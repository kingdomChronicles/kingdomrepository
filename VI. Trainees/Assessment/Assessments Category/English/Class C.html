      <p><b>Greetings...</b><br><br>

        You are still struggling to understand God's plan for your life and the Kingdom of God program remains unclear to you. Your focus on material things and worldly concerns may be distracting you and hindering your goal of entering the Kingdom of God. This distraction might be clouding your understanding of God's messages for you. Relying solely on your own strength and understanding in spiritual matters could prevent you from experiencing the joy that comes from the presence of the Holy Spirit. Without the Holy Spirit in your life, serving God may feel burdensome rather than fulfilling.<br><br>

        In your current spiritual state, you are still struggling to fully surrender yourself to God. You might be hesitant to let Him reign over every part of your being and to place your complete trust in Him. This reluctance could be preventing you from fully experiencing the transformative power of God's presence in your life.<br><br>

        And sometimes, you may still commit sin and neglect to ask God for forgiveness. This kind of faith and understanding of God is considered ineffective, as it lacks the true light of God's presence.<br><br>

        Hebrews 10:26-27 NLT <br>
        [26] Dear friends, if we deliberately continue sinning after we have received knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice that will cover these sins. [27] There is only the terrible expectation of Godâ€™s judgment and the raging fire that will consume his enemies. <br><br>

        1 John 3:6 NLT <br>
        [6] Anyone who continues to live in him will not sin. But anyone who keeps on sinning does not know him or understand who he is.<br><br>

        The Kingdom Chronicle program serves as a guide to help people develop a true understanding of God and lead them to have genuine, saving faith. Ultimately, however, an individual's salvation depends on their own sincerity and commitment. The truths presented in the Kingdom Chronicle are sufficient for seekers to cultivate a genuine faith that can lead to salvation.<br><br>

        To move forward into the true Kingdom of God, genuine repentance and dedication are essential. This spiritual level requires sincere repentance and a commitment to turn away from a sinful way of life, fostering a true faith that will lead you to the Kingdom of God. It is important to recognize where you are on your faith journey and make a conscious decision to open your heart to God.<br><br>

        Consider asking God for the strength and willingness to let go of control over your life and allow His Spirit to guide you. Embrace the opportunity for spiritual growth through genuine repentance by surrendering your life to Him and trusting in His plan for you.<br><br>

        If you are open to spiritual guidance, seeking mentorship from us can be highly beneficial. A mentor can provide guidance and support as you navigate your spiritual growth and help you develop a deeper relationship with God. Mentorship offers a space to ask questions, gain insights, and receive encouragement as you progress on your faith journey.<br><br>

        Remember, as long as you continue to seek to know Him, God is patient and loving, and He desires a genuine relationship with you. As you open your heart to Him, you will gradually experience the peace, joy, and fulfillment that come from living a life aligned with His will. May this journey lead you to a deeper understanding of God's love and a stronger connection with Him.
