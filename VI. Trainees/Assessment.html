<h2>Batch 001 : Day 1-6</h2>

         
            <p><h3>122E</h3> You have a very humble heart, the moment you have known Him you you never stop praising his goodness. You love Him so much and you never stop serving Him. God has stored great things for you, just continue on having that humble heart and an expectant heart towards Him. God loves you so much and you love God so much too. God has stored great things for you.</p>
            <p><h3>232J</h3> In your heart you have faith, and you want to serve Him, but your not giving your best to Him. Material things sometimes steal your supposedly time for Him. Make God your top most priority. He wants to reveal Himself to you, but your heart is not 100% surrendered to Him. Give your best time to God and work more on relationship level. Ask God on His direction and leading, ask God to cleanse you and purify your heart. </p>
            <p><h3>111J</h3> You have a deep longingness for your God, even if you are on a critical environment where worship to God is not the norm, but you always desire to want to know Him more. More and more in a personal way. You have a deep craving to know the mysteries of God, thus His words is like a sword that pierced your inner being as if God is directly speaking to your ears. And most of all, you want to be use by God in such a different way. Just continue to focus on your spiritual growth, and God will soon reveal to you the things which He has prepared  since your mother conceived you in her womb. </p>
            <p><h3>222R</h3> You have a seeking heart and a humble heart, you want to know Him on a different level, in order to achieve what your heart desire is to work on giving God the highest and top most priority. No matter how busy the world is, just continue to make your personal time with the Lord, giving Him the ample time to communicate to Him on a personal level. Dont just learn to know Him but rather know Him on a personal level. Walk with Him and He will give you the desire of your heart. God will use you mightily in bringing so much soul in His kingdom.</p>
            <p><h3>112E</h3> Your devotional program is not just an activity to you but it is God's personal message that continually cleanse you and serves as a tool for your spiritual growth. You have such a wonderful heart, continue to serve Him and continue to walk on that journey and God will give you the most satisfying life. And God will someday will say unto you, "Well done my faithful servant". He loves you so much and He is the source of your joy right now.</p>
            <p><h3>121A</h3> Everytime you are in your time with God having your fellowship with Him, God is giving you the understanding of His word so that you may carefully obey what is written on it. God wants to manifest Himself to you, work on your time fellowshipping with Him. Give Him the most prescious time you can give to Him. Ask matrure believers on how to experience God especially on how to walk on God, and soon you will experience Him personally, more than you can imagine.</p>
            <p><h3>222G</h3> You have the heart in approaching God, but you do not give your best to Him, ok ka na sa kalagayan mo sa Kanya, the heart you have now, mas makikilala mo pa Siya ng lubusan if only, na bibigyan mo siya ng more time and utmost priority to commune with Him as your personal God. He is your God but your faith is not close to Him. Work more on your personal relationship on Him, do not just know Him on a distant but walk close to Him.</p>
            <p><h3>233C</h3> The message of God strikes your heart, telling you that you need to follow my command my child, but you have a baggage that hinders you to see Him, He wants to have a genuine relationship to you, but as of now you are close to Him because you want an answer to God on something. Focus on establishing your relationship to Him, and He will give you an understanding that will make your faith strong, a conquering faith that will lead you the way to a successful and fulfiling life journey and your purpose as His creator will be satisfactory or if you only have a humble and genuine heart in approaching Him then God will manifest Himself to you.</p>
            <p><h3>211C</h3> Sometimes you have difficulty in understanding the words, but having a humble heart asking what is His will and what is the meaning of His word to you, God's wisdom is always available for you, because you are blessed in having a very humble heart
              towards your maker.</p>
            <p><h3>212R</h3> Even though you are young and you do not fully understand as of now the things of God you still have the highest level of faith believing that God is the best thing and the most important and the priority of your life. You give place God in your life as your top most priority as of now, and in due time God will raise you as His champion, just continue what you have started right now. Dont slow down on your faith to Him.</p>
            <p><h3>112M</h3> God has given you the understanding regarding His words, he has given you the wisdom not just knowledge in understanding His word to you. You always treated His word as God is speaking to you directly. Through your devotion, God is having a constant communion to you. God has chosen you to become His champion. But you need to have a conquering faith. Do not use your 5 physical senses in weighing things, do not even use your 6th sense which is Common Sense but rather use only your 7th sense which is the wisdom coming from God for you to understand things. If you rightfully use that sense, then God will show you things that will enlighten you, and you will become one of the great asset on God's Kingdom.  Weigh things based on God's wisdom and understanding. And as of now that is your present struggle, just continue on your learning, focus on the goal and continue to communion with Him, the one who called you before you were born.</p>
            <p><h3>222A</h3> You want to serve Him but you are only serving Him base on your mind. Serve Him base on your heart. He has reserve great things to you. But you want to walk on your faith on a distant level. Ask God on how to walk on Him hand in hand. Lay down everything to Him. Know Him on a personal level not just on intelectual level but strive to know Him on a relationship level. Work more on your personal relationship with Him so that God will reveal to you the great things He has stored for You.</p>
            <p><h3>232K</h3> God has given you wisdom, but you do not make God your priority. He wants to show Himself to you an ability that others dont have but you are not giving God the best of you. He wants your heart, walk on a relationship level on Him. Talk to Him as a friend, and treat Him as the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords .</p>
            <p><h3>322P</h3> You have a seeking heart. You always want to praise Him, serve Him on the level of understanding you have on Him. Do not hesitate to ask your brethren to help you guide and grow more on Him. They willhelp you to grow more on Him. </p>
            <p><h3>112B</h3> God has given you the understanding of His word, di ka na matatangay pa ng mga maling katuruan, huwag mo lang gagamitin ang iyong 5 senses to weigh situations. God is your priority now, and no one can snatch that love and your understanding to Him. Spiritualy you have reach a point where your spiritual growth will continually soar higher and higher. Be warned, o not used your emotions in doing the things of God, just rely on your faith and to His message on what you need to do.</p>
