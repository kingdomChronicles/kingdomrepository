        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 3:31</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p><sup>31</sup> "Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways,"</p>

        <br><hr>
        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Do Not Envy the Wicked</b></p>

        <p> These words of wisdom from King Solomon convey a timeless truth: the allure of wickedness and violence is fleeting, and its consequences are grave. This verse offers a profound warning not only against emulating such individuals but also against envying their perceived success. <br><br>

        In the preceding verses, Solomon outlines the characteristics of a godly life, emphasizing kindness, generosity, and peace. The command in verse 31 builds upon this progression by highlighting the stark contrast between righteousness and violence. A "man of violence" represents more than just physical aggression; he embodies selfishness, cruelty, and greed. Though such individuals may appear to gain wealth and power, their ways are corrupt and ultimately destructive.<br><br>
        
        The psalmist David offers similar wisdom in Psalm, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalms 37:1 NLT</b><br>
        Don’t worry about the wicked or envy those who do wrong.</i><br><br>
        
        - urging believers not to fret over evildoers or envy wrongdoers. Instead, he assures us that the little possessed by the righteous is far better than the abundance of the wicked. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalms 37:16 NLT</b><br>
        It is better to be godly and have little than to be evil and rich.</i><br><br>
        
        This reminds us that material prosperity achieved through immoral means is hollow and temporary.<br><br>
        
        Moreover, Proverbs 3:31 challenges believers to guard their hearts against bitterness or jealousy when witnessing the apparent success of the wicked. Asaph, the author of Psalm 73, struggled with envy when he observed the prosperity of the arrogant and wicked. They seemed free of troubles, overflowing with wealth, and filled with pride. However, Asaph’s perspective changed when he entered God's sanctuary and understood their ultimate fate. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalms 73:17-20 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>17</sup> Then I went into your sanctuary, O God, and I finally understood the destiny of the wicked. <sup>18</sup> Truly, you put them on a slippery path and send them sliding over the cliff to destruction. <sup>19</sup> In an instant they are destroyed, completely swept away by terrors. <sup>20</sup> When you arise, O Lord, you will laugh at their silly ideas as a person laughs at dreams in the morning.</i><br><br>
        
        The wicked may enjoy temporary success, but their end is destruction.<br><br>
        
        Like Asaph, many of us have once envied the lives of those we admired or idolized, yet they lived far from God, the reality is that many of these people, despite their wealth and fame, live in darkness, weighed down by sin and overwhelming struggles, with some even ending their lives in despair. Thanks be to God, who, in His mercy, reached out to us and lifted us from the dark pit of life.<br><br>

        The fleeting success of the wicked may appear appealing, but it ultimately leads to destruction. God's wisdom reminds us that the path of violence and wickedness is deceptive and brings spiritual ruin. On the other hand, the way of righteousness, though marked with challenges and sacrifices, leads to peace, joy, and eternal blessings.<br><br>

        Proverbs 3:31 calls us to trust in God's justice and provision, rejecting the temptation to envy or imitate the wicked. Instead, we are encouraged to walk in integrity, faith, and love. In doing so, we honor God and embrace a life that leads to true and lasting peace in Him.
