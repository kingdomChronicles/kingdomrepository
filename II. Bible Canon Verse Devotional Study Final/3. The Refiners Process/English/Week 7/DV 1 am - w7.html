        <h2>Proverbs 3:29</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p><sup>29</sup> "Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you."</p>

        <br><hr>
        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b></b></p> -->

        <p> Proverbs 3:29 delivers a clear command that aligns with God’s desire for His people to live in harmony, integrity, and love. It cautions us against any form of premeditated harm toward our neighbors, particularly when they live trustingly beside us. This verse is a continuation of the wisdom laid out in Proverbs 3:27–28, which urges us to do good and not withhold help from those in need. Together, these verses emphasize the moral principle of treating others with kindness, fairness, and respect. <br><br>

        The imagery behind the Hebrew word for "plan" provides a deeper understanding of the verse. It can mean "plowing" or "engraving," suggesting an act of intentional, deliberate preparation. To plan evil, then, is not a fleeting thought but a calculated action, as if engraving harm into one’s heart. The verse reveals the severity of such an act, particularly because it involves betraying the trust of someone who expects goodwill. A neighbor who dwells trustingly beside us assumes safety and respect, making any betrayal not just a personal sin but a violation of communal trust and God’s moral law.<br><br>
        
        Scripture consistently defends the sanctity of the neighborly relationship. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Exodus 20:16-17 NLT</b>
        <sup>16</sup> “You must not testify falsely against your neighbor. <sup>17</sup> “You must not covet your neighbor’s house. You must not covet your neighbor’s wife, male or female servant, ox or donkey, or anything else that belongs to your neighbor.”</i><br><br>
        
        The verses in Exodus commands us not to bear false witness or covet anything that belongs to our neighbor. These laws reflect God’s desire for justice and contentment within communities. To purposefully harm a neighbor contradicts the spirit of these commands, breaking the covenant of trust that God expects His people to uphold.<br><br>
        
        The tragic story of King David and Uriah offers a sobering example of the consequences of plotting evil against a neighbor. David, consumed by lust for Bathsheba, violated Uriah’s trust by orchestrating his death in battle after committing adultery with Bathsheba. David’s sin was not only an affront to Uriah but also a direct offense to God. Though David’s plan succeeded temporarily, God exposed his sin and brought judgment upon him. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Samuel 11:1-5 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>1</sup> In the spring of the year, when kings normally go out to war, David sent Joab and the Israelite army to fight the Ammonites. They destroyed the Ammonite army and laid siege to the city of Rabbah. However, David stayed behind in Jerusalem. <sup>2</sup> Late one afternoon, after his midday rest, David got out of bed and was walking on the roof of the palace. As he looked out over the city, he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking a bath. <sup>3</sup> He sent someone to find out who she was, and he was told, “She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” <sup>4</sup> Then David sent messengers to get her; and when she came to the palace, he slept with her. She had just completed the purification rites after having her menstrual period. Then she returned home. <sup>5</sup> Later, when Bathsheba discovered that she was pregnant, she sent David a message, saying, “I’m pregnant.”<br><br>
        
        <b>2 Samuel 11:6-9 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>6</sup> Then David sent word to Joab: “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent him to David. <sup>7</sup> When Uriah arrived, David asked him how Joab and the army were getting along and how the war was progressing. <sup>8</sup> Then he told Uriah, “Go on home and relax.” David even sent a gift to Uriah after he had left the palace. <sup>9</sup> But Uriah didn’t go home. He slept that night at the palace entrance with the king’s palace guard. <sup>10</sup> When David heard that Uriah had not gone home, he summoned him and asked, “What’s the matter? Why didn’t you go home last night after being away for so long?”<br><br>
        
        
        <b>2 Samuel 11:11-13 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>11</sup> Uriah replied, “The Ark and the armies of Israel and Judah are living in tents, and Joab and my master’s men are camping in the open fields. How could I go home to wine and dine and sleep with my wife? I swear that I would never do such a thing.” <sup>12</sup> “Well, stay here today,” David told him, “and tomorrow you may return to the army.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. <sup>13</sup> Then David invited him to dinner and got him drunk. But even then he couldn’t get Uriah to go home to his wife. Again he slept at the palace entrance with the king’s palace guard. <br><br>
        
        <b>2 Samuel 11:14-17 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>14</sup> So the next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and gave it to Uriah to deliver. <sup>15</sup> The letter instructed Joab, “Station Uriah on the front lines where the battle is fiercest. Then pull back so that he will be killed.” <sup>16</sup> So Joab assigned Uriah to a spot close to the city wall where he knew the enemy’s strongest men were fighting. <sup>17</sup> And when the enemy soldiers came out of the city to fight, Uriah the Hittite was killed along with several other Israelite soldiers.<br><br>
        
        <b>2 Samuel 12:1-7 NLT</b> <br>
        <sup>1</sup> So the Lord sent Nathan the prophet to tell David this story: “There were two men in a certain town. One was rich, and one was poor. <sup>2</sup> The rich man owned a great many sheep and cattle. <sup>3</sup> The poor man owned nothing but one little lamb he had bought. He raised that little lamb, and it grew up with his children. It ate from the man’s own plate and drank from his cup. He cuddled it in his arms like a baby daughter. <sup>4</sup> One day a guest arrived at the home of the rich man. But instead of killing an animal from his own flock or herd, he took the poor man’s lamb and killed it and prepared it for his guest.” <sup>5</sup> David was furious. “As surely as the Lord lives,” he vowed, “any man who would do such a thing deserves to die! <sup>6</sup> He must repay four lambs to the poor man for the one he stole and for having no pity.” <sup>7</sup> Then Nathan said to David, “You are that man! The Lord, the God of Israel, says: I anointed you king of Israel and saved you from the power of Saul. <br><br>

        <b>2 Samuel 12:8-12 NLT</b> <br>
        <sup>8</sup> I gave you your master’s house and his wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. And if that had not been enough, I would have given you much, much more. <sup>9</sup> Why, then, have you despised the word of the Lord and done this horrible deed? For you have murdered Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the Ammonites and stolen his wife. <sup>10</sup> From this time on, your family will live by the sword because you have despised me by taking Uriah’s wife to be your own. <sup>11</sup> “This is what the Lord says: Because of what you have done, I will cause your own household to rebel against you. I will give your wives to another man before your very eyes, and he will go to bed with them in public view. <sup>12</sup> You did it secretly, but I will make this happen to you openly in the sight of all Israel.” </i><br><br>
        
        This narrative underscores the truth that no evil plan remains hidden from God and that such actions have profound consequences.<br><br>
        
        In practical terms, Proverbs 3:29 challenges us to examine our intentions and actions toward others. It calls us to uphold integrity in our relationships, refusing to entertain thoughts of envy, deceit, or harm. Instead, we are encouraged to live with generosity and compassion, fostering communities built on trust and love. This command aligns with the teaching of Jesus, who summarized the law as loving God and loving our neighbor as ourselves.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 22:37-39 NKJV</b><br>
        <sup>37</sup> Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ <sup>38</sup> This is the first and great commandment. <sup>39</sup> And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ </i><br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 3:29 serves as a reminder of the moral responsibility we carry toward those around us. To plot evil against a trusting neighbor is to violate not only their trust but also God’s design for human relationships. By choosing to act with kindness and integrity, we honor God and reflect His character to the world.
