        </center>

        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 3:32</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NKJV (New King James Version)</p>

        

        <p><sup>32</sup> For the perverse person is an abomination to the Lord, But His secret counsel is with the upright</p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>A Call to Uprightness</b></p>

        <p> "For the perverse person is an abomination to the Lord, but His secret counsel is with the upright". This verse highlights the stark contrast between the ways of the wicked and the ways of the righteous, providing a sobering reminder of how God views those who deviate from His path versus those who walk in integrity. <br><br>

        The Hebrew word translated as "perverse" implies someone who is bent, twisted, or crooked—someone who chooses to stray from the straight path that God has set. This person is not simply flawed but actively embraces dishonesty, fraudulence, and selfishness. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 14:2 NKJV</b><br>
        He who walks in his uprightness fears the Lord, But he who is perverse in his ways despises Him.</i><br><br>
        
        Proverbs 14:2 reinforces this truth by stating that the devious person despises the Lord. Such individuals walk in lawlessness, driven by pride and a disregard for moral and spiritual truth. Their actions are offensive to God, labeled as "abominations" because they violate His holiness and justice.<br><br>
        
        The Scriptures provide numerous examples of actions that are abominations to God. Proverbs 6 lists several,<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 6:16-19 NKJV</b><br>
        <sup>16</sup> These six things the Lord hates, Yes, seven are an abomination to Him: <sup>17</sup> A proud look, A lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, <sup>18</sup> A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil, <sup>19</sup> A false witness who speaks lies, And one who sows discord among brethren. </i><br><br>
        
        These behaviors reflect a heart that is far from God, one that prioritizes personal gain and pleasure over righteousness.<br><br>
        
        In contrast, the upright—the righteous and morally straight—enjoy a unique relationship with God. The phrase "His secret counsel is with the upright" conveys the idea of intimacy and trust. God welcomes the upright into His inner circle, sharing His wisdom, guidance, and blessings. This privilege is reserved for those who walk in obedience, humility, and faithfulness.<br><br>
        
        For believers, this verse serves as both a warning and an encouragement. It warns us to avoid the ways of the perverse and reject fellowship with those who embrace such a lifestyle. Associating with the crooked can lead to spiritual compromise and distance from God. Instead, believers are called to walk in uprightness, striving to live lives marked by honesty, integrity, and a commitment to God's ways.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 3:32 challenges us to examine our own hearts and paths. Are we walking in a way that honors God, or are we straying into crookedness? The promise of being in God's confidence—a relationship of trust and closeness—should inspire us to reject sin and pursue righteousness. By walking the straight and narrow path, we align ourselves with God's will and partake in the blessings of His guidance, protection, and eternal fellowship.
