        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 3:21</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
          

        <p><sup>21</sup> "My son, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight, preserve sound judgment and discretion;"</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Importance of Wisdom, Sound Judgment, and Discretion</b></p>

        <p> In Proverbs 3:21, Solomon offers a powerful reminder to his son: "My son, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight, preserve sound judgment and discretion." This verse encapsulates the essence of godly living, urging believers to prioritize wisdom, sound judgment, and discretion in every aspect of life. These qualities are not merely intellectual exercises but are tied to how we live out our faith and make decisions in a world full of competing choices. <br><br>

        Wisdom, in the context of Proverbs, is much more than an academic skill or intellectual capability. It is the ability to apply godly knowledge in practical, moral ways. Throughout Proverbs, wisdom is personified as a woman calling out to those who would listen. True wisdom encompasses not only understanding but also the correct moral judgments that align with God's will. In this passage, Solomon emphasizes that wisdom should never be out of our sight, meaning it must be the guiding principle of all our decisions and actions. In this way, wisdom becomes a path to victory—both spiritual and practical. <br><br>
        
        The phrase “sound judgment” in this verse can be understood as the success that comes from applying wisdom in a practical, discerning way. It suggests that those who have wisdom will naturally achieve success, not through mere luck or human effort but through godly understanding and application. Wisdom leads to decisions that yield favorable outcomes, while those who act without it may find themselves struggling to navigate life’s complexities. <br><br>
        
        The verse also highlights the importance of discretion. Discretion refers to the ability to make sound decisions, especially when faced with multiple options. It involves evaluating situations carefully and discerning the right course of action. The Hebrew term for discretion used here, me-zim'māh', carries an even broader meaning, including planning, plotting, and thoughtful consideration. This deeper understanding of discretion reminds us that decisions should not be made hastily or impulsively. Instead, we must pause, reflect, and assess how our actions will align with God's will. Discretion involves a careful balance of thinking before we act and knowing when not to act at all. It requires being attuned to the guidance of the Holy Spirit and making decisions that reflect His will. <br><br>
        
        This theme of making the right decisions is not new in the Bible. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Joshua 24:14-15 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>14</sup>  “Now therefore fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness. Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the Lord. <sup>15</sup> And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.”</i> <br><br>
        
        In the Book of  Joshua, Joshua challenges the Israelites to choose whom they will serve. He declared that he and his house would serve the Lord, urging the people to make a decisive choice: “Now therefore fear the LORD and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness… choose this day whom you will serve.” Similarly, we are called to make decisions that reflect our commitment in serving the Lord, often in the face of societal pressure to conform. This decision-making requires not just intellect but a heart aligned with God’s will and a willingness to discern His direction in each circumstance. <br><br>
        
        In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul reinforces the idea of discretion in decision-making when he urges Christians to avoid being conformed to the patterns of this world but instead to offer themselves to God as living sacrifices.  <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 12:1-2 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>1</sup>  I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. <sup>2</sup> Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. </i> <br><br>
        
        This call to reject worldly values and discern the will of God in all things is a form of discretion. It means refusing to let the world shape our decisions and instead choosing to follow God’s path, even when the choices are not always clear-cut or easy. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 Corinthians 10:23 NLT</b><br>
        You say, “I am allowed to do anything”—but not everything is good for you. You say, “I am allowed to do anything”—but not everything is beneficial. </i> <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 14:23 NLT</b><br>
        But if you have doubts about whether or not you should eat something, you are sinning if you go ahead and do it. For you are not following your convictions. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning.</i> <br><br>
        
        In 1 Corinthians and Romans, Paul provides further guidance on the need for discretion. Not all choices are inherently sinful, but some may not be beneficial for our spiritual growth or the growth of others. In these cases, discretion becomes vital in evaluating whether an action, even though permissible, is in alignment with God’s greater purpose for our lives. <br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 3:21 teaches us that wisdom, sound judgment, and discretion are essential for living a life that honors God. These qualities empower us to make decisions that are not only morally right but also lead to true success and fulfillment. As believers, we are called to make decisions that reflect our devotion to the Lord, seeking His guidance in all things. By preserving wisdom and discretion in our lives, we can navigate the challenges of the world with confidence, knowing that we are walking in the light of God’s truth.
