        <h2>Proverbs 3:25</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NKJV (New King James Version)</p>
          

        <p><sup>25</sup> "Do not be afraid of sudden terror, Nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes"</p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Trusting God in the Face of Sudden Terror</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 3:25 states, “Do not be afraid of sudden terror, nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes.” This verse, filled with wisdom and assurance, serves as a guiding principle for believers navigating life’s uncertainties. Solomon’s counsel to his son is as relevant today as it was in ancient times: fear should not dominate the hearts of those who trust in God. <br><br>

        In the preceding verses, Solomon highlights the blessings of living by godly wisdom and discretion. A life rooted in God’s principles not only fosters peace but also shields us from the destructive consequences of rebellion and wickedness. Those who choose righteousness often avoid the pitfalls of sin. However, Proverbs 3:25 acknowledges that even the righteous are not immune to sudden terror or the trouble caused by the wicked.<br><br>
        
        This verse provides two layers of assurance. First, it reminds believers that they are not to fear unexpected challenges or the schemes of evil people. Scripture repeatedly acknowledges the reality of hardship for God’s people. For instance, Psalm declares, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalm 34:19 ESV</b><br>
        Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all.</i><br><br>
        
        Trials and sudden troubles may come, but God remains our refuge.<br><br>
        
        Secondly, Proverbs 3:25 points to the ultimate security believers have in the Lord. While the wicked may face ruin and judgment, the righteous are spared from this fate. As Romans affirms,<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 8:1 ESV</b><br>
        There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. </i><br><br>
        
        The believer’s hope lies in God’s salvation, ensuring they are not swept away in the judgment reserved for the wicked.<br><br>
        
        This truth does not deny the natural response of fear when faced with terror or danger. However, Scripture encourages us to rise above fear by placing our confidence in God. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 10:28 NLT</b><br>
        “Don’t be afraid of those who want to kill your body; they cannot touch your soul. Fear only God, who can destroy both soul and body in hell. </i><br><br>
        
        Jesus emphasized this in Matthew, where He instructed His followers not to fear those who can kill the body but cannot harm the soul. Similarly, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalms 27:1 NLT</b><br>
        The Lord is my light and my salvation— so why should I be afraid? The Lord is my fortress, protecting me from danger, so why should I tremble?</i><br><br>
        
        David’s proclamation in Psalm serves as a powerful reminder of God’s unwavering protection.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 3:25 calls us to trust God’s sovereignty. Sudden terror may catch us off guard, but nothing surprises God. He is present in every storm, offering peace and assurance. This verse challenges believers to live courageously, knowing that God is their protector and deliverer. It also offers hope, reassuring us that the judgment of the wicked will not touch those redeemed by the Lord.<br><br>
        
        In a world fraught with uncertainties, Solomon’s timeless wisdom invites us to anchor our hearts in God’s promises. Fear need not rule our lives when we place our faith in the One who holds all things in His hands.
