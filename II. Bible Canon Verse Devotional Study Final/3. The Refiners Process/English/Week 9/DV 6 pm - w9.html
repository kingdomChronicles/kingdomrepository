        </center>

        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 5:2</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NASB (New American Standard Bible)</p>

        

        <p><sup>2</sup> So that you may maintain discretion And your lips may comply with knowledge.</p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Value of Discretion and Knowledgeable Speech</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 5:2 states, “So that you may maintain discretion and your lips may comply with knowledge”. In this verse, Solomon emphasizes the profound benefits of heeding wise counsel. The ultimate goal of his instruction is not merely to impart information but to equip his son with the ability to discern right from wrong and to speak words that reflect godly wisdom. <br><br>

        Solomon's teaching underscores the principle that true wisdom is not passive knowledge but the active ability to live in accordance with God’s principles. Discretion, as mentioned in this verse, refers to sound judgment and the ability to avoid harmful choices. This wisdom protects individuals from walking the path of sin and foolishness. Solomon seeks to guide his son to live with integrity, make godly decisions, and avoid the snares of an evil world.<br><br>
        
        Equally important is the way one speaks. Solomon encourages his son to use his lips to comply with knowledge. Scripture repeatedly warns against the misuse of words, highlighting how speech can either build up or destroy. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalm 1:1-2 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; <sup>2</sup> but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night.</i><br><br>
        
        It reminds us that those who delight in the law of the Lord will not walk in the way of sinners. Such individuals will reject the ways of the world, including its corrupt speech, such as gossip, profanity, lying, and foolish talk.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Ephesians 5:4 ESV</b><br>
        Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving. </i><br><br>
        
        Instead, godly wisdom calls for speech that edifies and glorifies God. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Ephesians 4:29 ESV</b><br>
        Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear. </i><br><br>
        
        The verse exhorts believers to speak words that build up and offer grace to others. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Colossians 4:6 ESV</b><br>
        Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person. </i><br><br>
        
        Furthermore, it instructs us to let our speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so we may know how to respond to others with wisdom and love. Words that come from a heart aligned with God’s Word bring encouragement, instruction, and thanksgiving to God.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Ephesians 5:19 NLT</b><br>
        singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, and making music to the Lord in your hearts. </i><br><br>
        
        Ultimately, our words and actions stem from what we feed our minds and hearts. If we allow ourselves to dwell on evil thoughts and ungodly influences, our words and deeds will reflect that corruption. However, if we immerse ourselves in the wisdom of Scripture, we will naturally align with what pleases the Lord. Discretion and knowledgeable speech are byproducts of a life deeply rooted in God’s Word and teachings.<br><br>
        
        Proverbs 5:2 serves as a timeless reminder of the power of wisdom in shaping our choices and our words. It challenges us to reflect on the counsel we heed and the words we speak. Are we, like Solomon’s son, attentive to godly instruction and diligent in applying it to our lives? By embracing wisdom and allowing Scripture to guide our thoughts and speech, we can live lives that honor God and inspire others to do the same.
