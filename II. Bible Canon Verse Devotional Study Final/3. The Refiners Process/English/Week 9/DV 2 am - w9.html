        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 4:20</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">KJV (King James Version)</p>
          

        <p><sup>20</sup> "My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings."</p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Listening with Intent</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 4:20 states, "My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings." This verse highlights the importance of intentional listening and paying close attention to wisdom. The imagery of inclining one’s ear paints a picture of someone leaning forward, straining to catch every word, and placing great value on the message being shared. It is a call to not only hear but to actively engage with and deeply consider godly counsel. <br><br>

        This idea of attentive listening is a recurring theme in Scripture. Merely hearing wise advice is insufficient; it must be heard with the purpose of understanding and applying it to life. Such careful listening reflects a heart that treasures wisdom and longs for guidance. Proverbs consistently emphasizes this, urging believers to treat godly wisdom as a precious treasure worth seeking and guarding.<br><br>
        
        Jesus Himself underscored the importance of listening carefully. He said, "Pay attention to what you hear". <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Mark 4:24 ESV</b><br>
        And he said to them, “Pay attention to what you hear: with the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and still more will be added to you. </i><br><br>
        
        In His parable of the sower, Jesus described four types of soil that represent the ways people receive God's Word. The seed that fell on the path symbolizes the Word that Satan quickly snatches away. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Mark 4:15 ESV</b><br>
        And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them. </i><br><br>
        
        The rocky ground represents those who receive the Word with joy but abandon it when trials arise. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Mark 4:16-17 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>16</sup> And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy. <sup>17</sup> And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away. </i><br><br>
        
        The thorny ground depicts those who initially accept the Word but allow worldly concerns, the deceitfulness of wealth, and material desires to choke its growth. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Mark 4:18-19 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>18</sup> And others are the ones sown among thorns. They are those who hear the word, <sup>19</sup> but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.</i> <br><br>
        
        Finally, the good soil represents those who hear the Word, accept it, and demonstrate its transformative power by bearing fruit in their lives.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Mark 4:20 ESV</b><br>
        But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.” </i><br><br>
        
        This parable underscores the necessity of listening with both open ears and an open heart. To incline one’s ear to wisdom means to welcome it eagerly, <i><b>prioritize</b></i> it above distractions, and allow it to shape one’s thoughts, attitudes, and actions. It requires <i><b>humility</b></i> to recognize the value of divine instruction and a <i><b>willingness to apply it</b></i>, even when it challenges personal desires or societal norms.<br><br>
        
        Proverbs 4:20 serves as a gentle but firm reminder of the responsibility we have in receiving God's Word. It is not enough to let wisdom passively enter our minds. We must actively seek to understand it, meditate on its truths, and implement it in our daily lives. True listening results in transformation, as God's Word takes root in our hearts and bears fruit that glorifies Him.<br><br>
        
        As believers, we are called to approach God's Word with attentiveness and reverence. By inclining our ears and hearts to His teachings, we align ourselves with His will and open the door for His wisdom to guide our paths. In doing so, we demonstrate our love for God and our commitment to living according to His truth.
