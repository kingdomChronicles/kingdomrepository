        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Staying on the Path of Righteousness</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 4:27 states, "Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil." This verse serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of remaining steadfast on the path of righteousness. Solomon concludes this chapter with a plea to his son to avoid deviating from the God-intended way and to deliberately turn away from evil. This advice stems from Solomon’s own experiences, as he painfully learned the consequences of being led astray. Later in life, he wrote in Ecclesiastes about the ultimate significance of honoring God above all else. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 Kings 11:4 ESV</b><br>
        For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not wholly true to the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father. <br><br>
        
        <b>Ecclesiastes 12:13 ESV</b><br>
        The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. </i><br><br>
        
        The command to not turn to the right or the left emphasizes the importance of complete obedience to God's wisdom. It rejects any alteration, no matter how small, such as misinterpreting the message, adding unnecessary burdens, or violating God's commandments. The Pharisees during Jesus' time exemplified those who fell into the trap of creating additional laws and traditions that distorted God's true purpose. This is also what the Apostle John stressed in his writing, as revealed by our Lord Jesus, that the true message of his writings must not be diminished, altered or added to. <br><br>

        <i><b>Revelation 22:18-19 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>18</sup> And I solemnly declare to everyone who hears the words of prophecy written in this book: If anyone adds anything to what is written here, God will add to that person the plagues described in this book. <sup>19</sup> And if anyone removes any of the words from this book of prophecy, God will remove that person’s share in the tree of life and in the holy city that are described in this book.</i><br><br>

        
        <i><b>Matthew 23:2-4 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>2</sup> “The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees are the official interpreters of the law of Moses. <sup>3</sup> So practice and obey whatever they tell you, but don’t follow their example. For they don’t practice what they teach. <sup>4</sup> They crush people with unbearable religious demands and never lift a finger to ease the burden.<br><br>
        
        <b>Mark 7:8-9 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>8</sup>  For you ignore God’s law and substitute your own tradition.” <sup>9</sup> Then he said, “You skillfully sidestep God’s law in order to hold on to your own tradition.</i> <br><br>
        
        God's directive is clear: we are not to alter or veer from His revealed path in any way.<br><br>
        
        The life of Samson illustrates the dangers of straying from God’s path. Samson, a Nazarite dedicated to the Lord from birth, was called to a life of strict devotion, including not cutting his hair, abstaining from alcohol, and avoiding unclean food. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Judges 13:5-7 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>5</sup> for behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb, and he shall begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines.” <sup>6</sup> Then the woman came and told her husband, “A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask him where he was from, and he did not tell me his name, <sup>7</sup> but he said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.’”</i><br><br>
        
        However, Samson repeatedly disregarded these vows. His relationship with Delilah, a heathen woman, led to his downfall when she betrayed him by cutting his hair, the source of his strength. Samson’s disobedience resulted in devastating consequences—he was captured, blinded, and humiliated by the Philistines. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Judges 16:19-22 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>19</sup> She made him sleep on her knees. And she called a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him. <sup>20</sup> And she said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And he awoke from his sleep and said, “I will go out as at other times and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the Lord had left him. <sup>21</sup> And the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze shackles. And he ground at the mill in the prison. <sup>22</sup> But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.  <br><br>

        <b>Judges 16:23-25 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>23</sup> Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice, and they said, “Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand.” <sup>24</sup> And when the people saw him, they praised their god. For they said, “Our god has given our enemy into our hand, the ravager of our country, who has killed many of us.” <sup>25</sup> And when their hearts were merry, they said, “Call Samson, that he may entertain us.” So they called Samson out of the prison, and he entertained them. They made him stand between the pillars. </i><br><br>

        His story is a sobering example of the cost of veering off God’s intended path.<br><br>
        
        Solomon's advice in Proverbs 4:27 calls us to avoid such outcomes by staying firmly rooted in the path of righteousness. Turning away from evil requires intentionality, discipline, and reliance on God’s Word. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 Chronicles 10:13 NLT</b><br>
        So Saul died because he was unfaithful to the Lord. He failed to obey the Lord’s command, and he even consulted a medium </i><br><br>
        
        When we face temptations, we are reminded of the promise which assures us that God will provide a way out so we can endure and overcome sin.<br><br>
        
        This verse challenges us to examine our own lives and decisions. Are we staying true to God’s commands, or are we allowing distractions, temptations, or our own desires to lead us astray? Following God’s path demands focus, faithfulness, and a heart committed to doing His will.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 4:27 reminds us that steadfast obedience to God’s way is the key to avoiding spiritual ruin. By refusing to turn to the right or the left, and by actively resisting evil, we honor God and fulfill His purpose for our lives. Let us strive to walk faithfully on the path of righteousness, knowing that it leads to life, peace, and the fulfillment of His promises.
