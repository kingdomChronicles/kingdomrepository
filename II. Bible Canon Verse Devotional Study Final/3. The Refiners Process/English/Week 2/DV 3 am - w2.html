        </center>


        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Series Lesson: The Consequences of Ignoring Wisdom</b></p> -->

        <p> Proverbs 1:30 says, "They would have none of my counsel and despised my every rebuke." This verse addresses the human tendency to reject wisdom and the inevitable consequences that follow such rejection. This rejection is not passive; it is deliberate. In this way, ignorance becomes a choice—a conscious decision to disregard the counsel that could lead to a life of righteousness and peace. <br><br>

        The Bible teaches that God has provided enough evidence in the world around us for everyone to begin their journey of seeking truth <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 1:18-20 NKJV</b> <sup>18</sup> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, <sup>19</sup> because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. <sup>20</sup> For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, </i><br><br>
        
        
        In fact, God promises to give wisdom to those who seek Him <br><br>
        
        <i><b> Matthew 7:7 NKJV</b> “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.</i><br><br>
        
        Yet, despite these provisions, many people turn away from the wisdom that comes from God. They refuse to acknowledge His authority, choosing instead to follow their own desires, which often lead to foolish decisions and sin. <br><br>
        
        When we refuse to listen to wisdom, or when we refuse to begin with the "fear of the Lord" (Proverbs 1:7), wisdom becomes invisible to us. We treat it as if it does not exist. As a result, we become susceptible to folly, falling into traps set by sin and human error. This rejection of wisdom has serious consequences, as even those who have accepted Christ as Savior are not immune to the natural results of their choices. While salvation offers spiritual security, the principle of cause and effect remains intact in our earthly lives. Foolish decisions often lead to pain, regret, and hardship. <br><br>
        
        Godly wisdom offers guidance that can protect us from unnecessary suffering. By seeking counsel from a divine perspective, we can avoid many of the pitfalls that come with human error and the randomness of life. Ultimately, the best defense against poor decisions and their consequences is a life lived in reverence and submission to God’s wisdom. This reverence, or "fear of the Lord," is the beginning of true understanding and leads to a life of fulfillment, purpose, and peace.
