            <h1>Daily Devotional Verses</h1>
        </center>

        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

                <h2>Proverbs 1:28-29</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NKJV (New King James Version)</p>

                

                <p><sup>28</sup> Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me.
                <sup>29</sup> Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord,</p>

                <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Importance of Seeking Wisdom Before Carrying Out Plans or Actions </b></p>
  
                <p>The verse under discussion reinforces the idea that the time to seek wisdom is before acting, not after. As human beings, we often fall into the trap of making impulsive decisions and only afterward, when we face the negative consequences, do we begin to question ourselves: “What should I do now?” This approach, however, is backward. The right time to ask that crucial question is before stepping into action. By not doing so, we set ourselves up for avoidable troubles. Once the consequences of poor choices start to manifest, we suddenly become motivated to analyze, plan, and strategize. But true wisdom lies not in reacting to disaster but in choosing the right path from the outset, by considering the potential consequences before they arrive. Instead of frantically trying to escape the results of our poor decisions, we should be listening to wisdom beforehand and avoiding such consequences entirely. <br><br>

                When we experience the results of our wrong choices, it is common to look back with regret, wishing we had made the wiser choice earlier. We recall the moments when wisdom beckoned us, and yet, we ignored her voice. The saying “hindsight is 20/20” aptly describes this scenario, much like the message found in the book of Proverbs. Wisdom often becomes most evident when we are already facing the consequences of ignoring it. This sentiment is mirrored in Proverbs 1:26, where the haunting memory of disregarded good advice lingers. <br><br>
                
                Proverbs 1:7 serves as the key verse for the entire book, with verse 29 emphasizing the devastation that follows when we ignore the pursuit of wisdom. True wisdom is firmly rooted in a reverent “fear” of God—a respectful acknowledgment of His authority and guidance. When we fail to give God His rightful place in our lives, we despise the knowledge that would have led us to act wisely. Instead of embracing the wisdom that comes from respecting God’s will, we find ourselves pursuing a path of ignorance, which eventually leads to catastrophe. <br><br>
                
                The strong language used in passages like these, particularly the words "hate" and "despise," should be understood in their proper context. During the time these scriptures were written, extreme contrasts were often used to drive home a point. In this case, those who choose ignorance over wisdom are said to “hate” knowledge, though this is not meant to be taken in an absolute, literal sense. Rather, in symbolic terms, it suggests that they have rejected true knowledge—a knowledge grounded in reverence for God—and chosen something else in its place. <br><br>
                
                In essence, the message here is clear: wisdom calls out to us before we act, and it is our responsibility to listen and choose the right path. <b><i>True wisdom comes from acknowledging God’s role in our lives and seeking His guidance before we make decisions that could lead us into disaster. Acting with wisdom is not just about correcting the consequences of wrong decisions but about avoiding them from the start by seeking wisdom and steering clear of their eternal consequences, where there is no room for regret because it is already too late.
                </i></b>
