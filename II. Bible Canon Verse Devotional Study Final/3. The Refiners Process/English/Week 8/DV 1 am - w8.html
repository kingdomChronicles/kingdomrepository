        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 4:6</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p><sup>6</sup> "Don’t turn your back on wisdom, for she will protect you. Love her, and she will guard you."</p>

        <br><hr>
        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Value of Wisdom</b></p>

        <p> In Proverbs 4:6, David imparts timeless wisdom to his son Solomon: "Don’t turn your back on wisdom, for she will protect you. Love her, and she will guard you". Through the personification of wisdom as a woman, David emphasizes its indispensable role in life. By staying close to wisdom, Solomon is assured of guidance, protection, and a secure path. This counsel remains profoundly relevant for Christians today as they navigate the challenges of a fallen world. <br><br>

        David’s use of personification presents wisdom as a nurturing and protective figure. She is not a distant or abstract concept but a constant companion whose presence ensures safety and stability. By loving wisdom and staying by her side, Solomon—and by extension, all believers—are shielded from the pitfalls of foolishness and sin. Those who embrace wisdom and live by godly principles are far less likely to suffer the consequences of immoral or destructive choices. Wisdom serves as a safeguard, preserving the lives of those who cherish her.<br><br>
        
        In the New Testament, the apostle Paul echoes this principle, warning believers about false teachers who masquerade as angels of light. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Corinthians 11:13-14 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>13</sup> For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. <sup>14</sup> And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. </i><br><br>
        
        These individuals present teachings that seem appealing but ultimately lead to spiritual ruin. Paul’s concern for the Corinthians mirrors David’s for Solomon: that they might be led astray from a sincere devotion to God. Paul likens their faith to a betrothal, urging them to remain pure and steadfast in their commitment to Christ. This underscores the importance of guarding one’s heart and mind against deceitful influences by adhering to divine wisdom.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 Timothy 6:20 ESV</b><br>
        O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you. Avoid the irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called “knowledge,” </i><br><br>
        
        Similarly, Paul advises Timothy to “guard the deposit” entrusted to him. 
        This deposit refers to the truth of God’s Word and the wisdom it imparts. Timothy is instructed to avoid meaningless chatter and false knowledge, which can erode faith and lead to confusion. Like Solomon, Timothy is called to cling to wisdom, ensuring that his life and ministry remain grounded in truth.<br><br>
        
        For Christians, the path of wisdom is illuminated by God’s Word. Scripture provides guidance, enabling believers to discern right from wrong and resist the allure of false teachings. Wisdom calls believers to live with integrity, humility, and devotion to God, qualities that shield them from the snares of sin and the consequences of folly.<br><br>
        
        In conclusion, Proverbs 4:6 serves as a powerful reminder of the value of wisdom in the believer’s life. David’s counsel to Solomon, Paul’s exhortations to the Corinthians, and Timothy’s charge to guard the truth all point to the necessity of embracing and cherishing godly wisdom. By staying true to God’s Word and loving His wisdom, Christians find not only protection but also the strength to live lives that honor Him. Wisdom is a treasure that guards the hearts of those who seek it, guiding them on the path of righteousness.
