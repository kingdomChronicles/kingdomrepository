        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 4:8</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p><sup>8</sup> "If you prize wisdom, she will make you great. Embrace her, and she will honor you."</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Value of Wisdom</b></p>

        <p> "If you prize wisdom, she will make you great. Embrace her, and she will honor you." These words from Proverbs 4:8 echo the timeless truth that wisdom, when treasured and embraced, brings exaltation and honor to one’s life. Wisdom, as described in the book of Proverbs, is more than knowledge; it is the ability to live in alignment with godly principles. Without wisdom, life can easily spiral into shame, regret, dishonor, and misery. However, those who cherish wisdom find themselves elevated, respected, and honored, both by God and by others. <br><br>

        Wisdom is not an inherent quality but a divine gift from God. Yet, He bestows it only upon those who actively seek and prize it. Solomon, the writer of Proverbs, recalls learning the importance of wisdom from his father, King David. This teaching emphasizes the need to pursue wisdom with a heart that treasures God’s Word and desires His guidance. Such pursuit aligns with the principle found in 1 Samuel, <br><br>

        <i><b>1 Samuel 2:30 NLT</b><br>
        “Therefore, the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I promised that your branch of the tribe of Levi would always be my priests. But I will honor those who honor me, and I will despise those who think lightly of me. </i><br><br>
        
        - where the Lord declares, "Those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed."<br><br>
        
        Jesus Christ provides the ultimate example of honoring God through wisdom. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Philippians 2:7-8 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>7</sup> Instead, he gave up his divine privileges; he took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being. When he appeared in human form, <sup>8</sup> he humbled himself in obedience to God and died a criminal’s death on a cross.</i><br><br>
        
        The verse illustrates how Jesus, though fully God, humbled Himself as a servant and obeyed the Father even to the point of death on a cross. Because of His faithfulness, God exalted Him above all, giving Him "the name that is above every name".<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Philippians 2:9 ESV</b><br>
        Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,</i><br><br> 
        
        This pattern reveals that true greatness comes through humility, obedience, and a commitment to godly wisdom.<br><br>
        
        Moreover, God extends this honor to all who follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Believers who value wisdom, live in obedience, and put their faith in God are promised rewards in His kingdom. They are granted crowns of righteousness and the privilege of reigning with Christ during His Millennial Kingdom.<br><br>
        
        In conclusion, Proverbs 4:8 teaches us that wisdom is not merely an option but a necessity for a life that is truly great and honorable. To prize and embrace wisdom is to align oneself with God’s will, thereby securing both His favor and eternal rewards. May we always seek, cherish, and live by wisdom, for in doing so, we honor God and are honored in return.
