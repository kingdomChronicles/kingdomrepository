        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 3:7-8</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>

        <p><sup>7</sup> Don’t be impressed with your own wisdom. Instead, fear the Lord and turn away from evil.
        <sup>8</sup> Then you will have healing for your body and strength for your bones.</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Trusting God for Healing and Strength</b></p>

        <p> 
          Proverbs 3:7–8 teaches a timeless principle: <i>"Don’t be impressed with your own wisdom. Instead, fear the Lord and turn away from evil. Then you will have healing for your body and strength for your bones."</i> These verses, penned by King Solomon, highlight the blessings that flow from a life grounded in humility, reverence for God, and a commitment to righteousness. <br><br>

          Solomon emphasizes that trusting in one's own wisdom is futile compared to relying on God's infinite knowledge. Fearing the Lord—a deep reverence and respect for His authority—leads to wise living, while turning away from evil keeps us from the harm caused by sin. The result is a life marked by healing and strength, both physically and spiritually.<br><br>

          The connection between obedience to God and well-being is not a new concept.<br><br>

          <i><b>Exodus 15:22-26 ESV</b><br>
          <sup>22</sup> Then Moses made Israel set out from the Red Sea, and they went into the wilderness of Shur. They went three days in the wilderness and found no water. <sup>23</sup> When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter; therefore it was named Marah. <sup>24</sup> And the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?” <sup>25</sup> And he cried to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a log, and he threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. There the Lord made for them a statute and a rule, and there he tested them, <sup>26</sup> saying, “If you will diligently listen to the voice of the Lord your God, and do that which is right in his eyes, and give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you that I put on the Egyptians, for I am the Lord, your healer.”</i><br><br>

          In Exodus 15:22–26, the Israelites faced a crisis at Marah, where they found undrinkable bitter water. Their grumbling revealed a lack of trust, but God intervened, sweetening the water and giving them a promise: if they would listen to His voice and follow His commands, He would protect them from the diseases that plagued the Egyptians. God identified Himself as their healer, highlighting the link between obedience and health.<br><br>

          This principle remains relevant today. While God's promise of healing in Exodus was directed specifically to Israel, the general truth applies universally: a life aligned with God's will often leads to physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. By avoiding destructive behaviors and embracing godly wisdom, we reduce the risks of harm caused by sin and poor choices.<br><br>

          Moreover, this passage underscores that God is not only concerned with our spiritual health but also with our holistic well-being. When we trust Him, acknowledge His authority, and turn from evil, we align ourselves with His design for life. This alignment brings a sense of peace and refreshment that sustains us even in challenging times.<br><br>

          In conclusion, Proverbs 3:7–8 reminds us to reject pride in our own understanding and to submit to God's guidance. When we revere Him and walk in His ways, He blesses us with healing and strength, enabling us to navigate life's trials with resilience and grace. Let us strive to maintain a close relationship with the Lord, trusting Him wholeheartedly, and experiencing the abundant life He promises.
