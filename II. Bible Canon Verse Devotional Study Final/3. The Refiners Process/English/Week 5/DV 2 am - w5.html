        <h2>Proverbs 3:7</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p><sup>7</sup> "Don’t be impressed with your own wisdom. Instead, fear the Lord and turn away from evil."</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Humility, Reverence, and Turning From Evil</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 3:7 says, <i>"Don’t be impressed with your own wisdom. Instead, fear the Lord and turn away from evil."</i> This verse speaks directly to the human tendency to trust in our own intellect and judgment over the wisdom of God. It challenges us to adopt a posture of humility, acknowledging that our understanding is finite and flawed compared to the infinite wisdom of the Creator. Solomon, the wisest man to ever live, penned these words to remind us that true wisdom begins with reverence for God, not reliance on human reasoning. <br><br>

        In today’s world, where self-confidence and self-reliance are often celebrated, it can be tempting to trust in our own knowledge and abilities. However, Proverbs 3:7 warns against being impressed with ourselves or placing ultimate confidence in our own wisdom. This is not to say that we should act without thought, planning, or discernment, but rather that our wisdom should always be subordinate to God’s. Human understanding, no matter how advanced or logical it seems, is limited and prone to error. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 1:22-23 AMP</b><br>
        <sup>22</sup> Claiming to be wise, they became fools, <sup>23</sup> and exchanged the glory and majesty and excellence of the immortal God for an image [worthless idols] in the shape of mortal man and birds and four-footed animals and reptiles. </i><br><br>
        
        As the verses explains, those who reject God often claim wisdom but end up as fools by worshiping created things rather than the Creator. This misplacement of trust leads to false assumptions, poor decisions, and ultimately, destruction.<br><br>
        
        Instead of exalting our own wisdom, the verse calls us to "fear the Lord," which means to have a deep respect, awe, and reverence for Him. This reverence is the foundation of true wisdom, as echoed: <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Job 28:28 NLT</b><br>
        And this is what he says to all humanity: ‘The fear of the Lord is true wisdom; to forsake evil is real understanding.’</i><br><br>
        
        Fearing the Lord involves recognizing His authority, trusting in His perfect will, and obeying His commands. It requires us to acknowledge that God’s ways are higher than our ways and to submit to His guidance, even when we do not fully understand His plans.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Isaiah 55:8-9 KJV</b><br>
        <sup>8</sup> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. <sup>9</sup> For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</i><br><br>
        
        Turning away from evil is another critical aspect of this verse. Reverence for God naturally leads to a rejection of sin and unrighteousness. To fear the Lord is to love what He loves and hate what He hates. This was exemplified in the life of Job, who suffered greatly without understanding why. Despite his confusion and pain, Job remained steadfast in his reverence for God and refused to turn to evil. His unwavering faith allowed him to endure trials and ultimately led to restoration and blessing. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Job 42:10-17 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>10</sup> When Job prayed for his friends, the Lord restored his fortunes. In fact, the Lord gave him twice as much as before! <sup>11</sup> Then all his brothers, sisters, and former friends came and feasted with him in his home. And they consoled him and comforted him because of all the trials the Lord had brought against him. And each of them brought him a gift of money and a gold ring. <sup>12</sup> So the Lord blessed Job in the second half of his life even more than in the beginning. For now he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 teams of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. <sup>13</sup> He also gave Job seven more sons and three more daughters. <sup>14</sup> He named his first daughter Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. <sup>15</sup> In all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of Job. And their father put them into his will along with their brothers. <sup>16</sup> Job lived 140 years after that, living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren. <sup>17</sup> Then he died, an old man who had lived a long, full life.</i><br><br>
        
        Job’s life demonstrates that fearing the Lord and rejecting evil are not just theoretical ideas but practical choices that can sustain us through life’s hardships.<br><br>
        
        The wisdom of Proverbs 3:7 invites us to live a life of humility, dependence on God, and moral integrity. It reminds us that our own wisdom is not enough to navigate the complexities of life. Instead, we must trust in God’s infinite understanding and walk in His ways. This requires us to let go of pride, acknowledge our limitations, and place our confidence in the Lord. As we do so, we will find that reverence for God and turning away from evil leads not only to wisdom and understanding but also to a life that honors Him and brings us peace.<br><br>
        
        In conclusion, Proverbs 3:7 teaches us to resist the temptation of self-reliance and instead anchor our lives in the fear of the Lord. It calls us to acknowledge the insufficiency of human wisdom, trust in God’s perfect plan, and turn away from sin. By embracing these principles, we can live a life that reflects true wisdom and faithfulness to God. Solomon’s timeless counsel reminds us that humility before God is the first step toward a life of purpose, peace, and eternal blessing.
