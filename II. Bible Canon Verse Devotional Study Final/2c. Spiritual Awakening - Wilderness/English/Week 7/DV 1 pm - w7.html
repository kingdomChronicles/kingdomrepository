      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

          <h2>Isaiah 53:8</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
                <p>
                  <sup>8</sup> By oppression and judgment he was taken away. Yet who of his generation protested? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was punished.
                </p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>As we continue our devotional series on the 700-year prophecy about the coming Messiah from the book of Isaiah, we reflect on a profound verse that sheds light on Jesus' demeanor and purpose.<br><br>

                <i>Read Mark 11:1-11, Luke 19:28-40, John 12:12-19, and Matthew 21:1-11. On how the different Gospel portrays the entry of their King in Jerusalem.</i><br><br>

                As the verses describe, in the days leading up to Jesus' death, He entered Jerusalem in a triumphal parade. The people of the city rejoiced, showering Him with praises and Messianic titles. Everything seemed to be going well. They had witnessed His miracles and heard His teachings. They welcomed Him as their King, eagerly anticipating that He would cast out the Romans, take the throne of David, and begin His reign over the world.<br><br>

                For the first time in this passage, we see that the suffering Christ would endure would end in death. It was unimaginable that the Messiah would die. The text says, “who considered that He was cut off out of the land of the living.” The thought of His impending death did not enter their minds. Even the disciples, whom He had directly told that He would die, did not believe it. The idea of His death did not match what they were seeing. They saw power, miracles, and authority. They saw the divine.<br><br>

                Yet, it all ended in death. This illustrates the theology of substitution once more. He was struck down "for the transgression of the people." The only way to bear humanity's sins was for Christ, their King, to die for them. <br><br>

                The triumphal entry into Jerusalem and the subsequent death of Jesus Christ are profound demonstrations of the unpredictable and unfathomable nature of God's plan. The people expected a political savior who would overthrow the Roman oppressors and restore the earthly kingdom of Israel. Instead, they received a spiritual Savior whose mission was far greater than mere political liberation. His mission was to offer redemption and eternal life to all humanity.<br><br>

                God's plan is beyond human imagination; we cannot fathom the mind of God or conceive the good things He has prepared for those who have love and faith in Him.<br><br>


                Jesus' death on the cross, a concept so foreign to the expectations of the people, highlighted the deep chasm between human understanding and divine wisdom. The disciples, despite being closest to Him, could not grasp the necessity of His sacrifice. Their vision was limited to immediate deliverance and earthly power, whereas Jesus' purpose encompassed the eternal salvation of souls.<br><br>

                The theology of substitution is central to this narrative. Jesus, the sinless Son of God, took upon Himself the sins of humanity and endured the punishment that was rightfully ours. This act of ultimate love and sacrifice was not something that could be conceived by human minds. It defied logic and expectation, demonstrating the boundless depth of God's love and His perfect plan for redemption.<br><br>

                God's plan, as evidenced by the life and death of Jesus, is far beyond human comprehension. It is a plan woven with grace, mercy, and profound wisdom. While we may not always understand His ways, we are called to trust in His divine purpose. Just as the people of Jerusalem could not foresee the significance of Jesus' death, we too may not always see the immediate outcomes of God's plans in our lives. Yet, we are assured that His plans are for our ultimate good.<br><br>

                In conclusion, the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem and His subsequent crucifixion underscore the vast difference between human expectation and divine reality. It challenges us to trust in God's greater plan, even when it defies our understanding. Through Jesus' sacrifice, we are invited into a relationship with God that transcends the limitations of this world and offers eternal hope. God's plan is indeed not something that people could ever come up with, but it is the perfect plan for the redemption of humanity.<br><br>

                As the establishment of God's Kingdom on earth in the Last Days approaches, God's reign will be realized through His chosen children.<br><br>

                The question is: Are you ready to be part of God's Kingdom, embrace His divine purpose, and dedicate yourself to advancing His Kingdom on earth?<br><br>
                
                If your answer is <b>YES</b>, you want to be part of those advancing God's Kingdom.<br><br>
                
                In your reflection, include the phrase: <u>"Yes, I want to be part of advancing God's Kingdom."</u> A separate meeting will be held for all who accept the challenge to serve God at a higher level in His Kingdom. This meeting will address various aspects of the work needed to continue expanding His Kingdom on earth.</p>
