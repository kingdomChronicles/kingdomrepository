                <h2>Matthew 25:1-13</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
                <p>   
                    <sup>1</sup>  “Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. 
                    <sup>2</sup> Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 
                    <sup>3</sup> The five who were foolish didn’t take enough olive oil for their lamps, 
                    <sup>4</sup> but the other five were wise enough to take along extra oil. 
                    <sup>5</sup> When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep. 
                    <sup>6</sup>  “At midnight they were roused by the shout, ‘Look, the bridegroom is coming! Come out and meet him!’ 
                    <sup>7</sup>  “All the bridesmaids got up and prepared their lamps. 
                    <sup>8</sup> Then the five foolish ones asked the others, ‘Please give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out.’ 
                    <sup>9</sup>  “But the others replied, ‘We don’t have enough for all of us. Go to a shop and buy some for yourselves.’ 
                    <sup>10</sup>  “But while they were gone to buy oil, the bridegroom came. Then those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was locked. 
                    <sup>11</sup> Later, when the other five bridesmaids returned, they stood outside, calling, ‘Lord! Lord! Open the door for us!’ 
                    <sup>12</sup>  “But he called back, ‘Believe me, I don’t know you!’ 
                    <sup>13</sup>  “So you, too, must keep watch! For you do not know the day or hour of my return.

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>This story invites us to examine our own readiness. When will the Kingdom of God close its doors to those seeking salvation? We don't know when it will happen, and it will likely come unexpectedly. No one knows when this event will occur.</p>

                <p>Remember, we are significantly involved in what happens. We have already been warned that these things will occur someday. Just as the bridesmaids had the role of meeting the bridegroom on his way to the bride's home, we have a role to play as we wait for the events that will unfold in the Kingdom of God.</p>

                <p>We understand that our acceptance depends on how we participate while waiting. Simply volunteering to be part of the welcome, or what we might call "giving our hearts to God" and having a moment of change without maintaining and continuing spiritual growth, is not enough.</p>

                <p>Many of us today claim that we have accepted the Lord into our lives, but in reality, most only profess this with their lips, not with their hearts. True acceptance involves being prepared, living in a state of readiness, and always anticipating His return.</p>

                <p>The foolish bridesmaids agreed to be part of the wedding party, but they weren't truly committed. They were prepared for the short term, but not for the long, steady journey of obedience. Many of us today are like those foolish bridesmaids. We might go to church, but we don't follow God's will. If we say we are Christians but don't live by His Word and openly go against His will, then we are just like the foolish bridesmaids.</p>

                <p>The wise bridesmaids, however, came prepared and brought extra supplies. They understood their responsibilities and whom they were obeying. We can consider ourselves among the wise bridesmaids if we follow God's will. The oil represents our readiness, meaning our obedience to His will that comes from our hearts. We should always keep our lamps filled with oil so that they will not flicker and continue to shine brightly.</p>

                <p>Consistently studying His Word and obeying what is written in it represents our continual supply of the Oil of the Lord, which is the Word of God being applied in our lives.</p>

                <p>The foolish bridesmaids represent professing Christians today who are part of churches and have their own rituals and their own condition in attending worship services. They engage in similar activities like the children of God. However, they do not live out the Word of God. Their worship is only lip service and outward actions meant to be seen by others.</p>

                <p>While the wise bridesmaids were the true disciples of God, they were open to training and correction through God's Word. They continuously improved their spiritual journey through daily practice and communion with God by His Word.</p>

                <p>The Book of Proverbs states, “The light of the righteous rejoices, but the lamp of the wicked goes out.” Preparedness, therefore, is evident in how we decide to live according to God's complete plan for us. In essence, we are letting God shape us according to His will as expressed in His Word.</p>

                <p>Merely calling ourselves Christians or followers of Christ is not sufficient; we must also act on what God tells us to do by following His instructions in His Word. Those who genuinely believe will strive to live by keeping their lamps burning.</p>

                <p>We come to understand God, and in a mysterious manner, He has His own method of calling us. In return, we come to be recognized by God as we demonstrate our faith in Him through our actions.</p>

                <p>Through inward acts of devotion like prayer, reading, and meditating on Scripture, as well as outward actions of loving and serving our neighbors in public and communal worship, we live according to God's complete will, which involves both our inward and outward actions in accordance with His Word.</p>

                <p>So, we always show our expectation of Christ's return, being a crucial part of the event that we have firmly based our lives on. Those who follow God's Word will never be embarrassed, as doing God's will shows that we are always ready for whatever will occur in the events of the Kingdom of God.</p>

                <p>We might consider whether Jesus included the detail about all the bridesmaids falling asleep to remind us that we can be diligent without being overwhelmed and overworked. In the story, being asleep does not symbolize sin or state of lukewarmness but rather an act of trust. </p>
                  
                <p>However, readiness is different; it pertains to our ongoing relationship with Him. This means that every day, every hour, every minute—in short, all the time—we must be connected with our God. This connection should not be superficial, expressed only through words and outward actions, but should originate deep within our hearts.</p>

                <p>When the bridegroom appears unexpectedly, no one knows when it will happen. However, if we are living according to His will, our way of life will already demonstrate our preparedness to welcome him. We will have more than enough spiritual fuel to light our way upon his return.</p>

                <p>One important lesson from this is that salvation is personal and cannot be shared. You cannot give your salvation to others such as friends, siblings, parents, or children because each person's salvation is individual. Our role is to guide them to the path of salvation, and their response of faith should be directed towards God for their own salvation.</p>

                <p>So, we should not hesitate in our faith, nor should we imitate the unprepared foolish bridesmaids. Let us not wait until it is too late and God tells us He does not know us. Instead, let us keep our lamps filled with oil by daily devoting ourselves to the Word of God. Amen.</p>
