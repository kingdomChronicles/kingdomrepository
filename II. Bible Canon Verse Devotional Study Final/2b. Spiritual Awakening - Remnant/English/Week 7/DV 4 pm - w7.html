  <p class="SCQoute">This devotion will guide you on how to pray to God as though you are speaking to your Father or a close friend.</p>


  <p class="chapterTitle">Prayer that touches the heart of God</p>    
                   
   



  <h2>Matthew 6:5-8 </h2>
  <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>

  <p>
    <sup>5</sup>  “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 
    <sup>6</sup> But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 
    <sup>7</sup> And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 
    <sup>8</sup> Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

  <h2 class="chapterTitle">INSTRUCTION:</h2> <br>
  <p>Seek guidance from God through His Holy Spirit to assist you in carefully following each step of your devotion.</p>

 <ol>
        
        <li> Find a quiet room and close the door to avoid any interruptions while you have a meaningful conversation with God through prayer. Remember, even though you cannot see your Father, you can feel His presence because His Spirit is already within you.</li>
        <li> Prepare all the lists you've made so you can offer them to God during your prayer.</li>
        <li> In your prayer, release forgiveness for all the names on your list—those who have hurt you. Read each name and forgive them one by one.</li>
        <li> In your prayer, ask God for forgiveness for all the names on your list—those whom you have hurt. Read each name and ask God to forgive you.</li>
        <li> Confess and offer to God all your concerns written on your list.</li>
        <li> Then, envision yourself in a room, approaching God's Holy throne. Leave behind everything that is not pleasing in His sight as you prepare for your prayer session.</li>
        <li> Abandon all your accomplishments, big and small. God is not concerned about them.</li>
        <li> Let go of any pride in your physical appearance, as God does not care about it.</li>
        <li> Humble yourself completely as you spiritually face God's Holy throne.</li>
        <li> Surrender even your intelligence, as God is not concerned about the extent of your knowledge.</li>
        <li> Reject everything your physical senses are experiencing—what you see, feel, and hear.</li>
        <li> Prepare your headphones before you begin to pray. </li>
        <li> Before clicking on the video link, proceed to the next step.</li>
        <li> Kneel before the Lord.</li>
        <li> Visualize and imagine yourself spiritually like this: Hold your heart as if you are taking it out from your chest and slowly lift it up to God.</li>
        <li> Allow your heart to do all the talking. That is the real you.</li>
        <li> Watch the video and wait for the Holy Spirit to move you in prayer. Confess everything you want to tell God.</li>
        <li> Continue until you feel God is finished with you. Let the music video play throughout your prayer session. Number 19 should be done after your prayer session with God.</li>
        <li> Reflect on how God moved during your prayer time.</li>
 </ol>

                  <p><i>Listening/Watching to uplifting Music/Video can help prepare your heart and mind for prayer. It can also be a beautiful way to connect with God before you begin praying. </i> </p>
      
                  <p><i>If you have a headset then better use one and feel God's presence while you pray. Sing a song to God through this Music Video/s</i></p>
