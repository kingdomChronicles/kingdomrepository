      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>Ezekiel 33:1-9</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
      <p> 
          
        <sup>1</sup> Once again a message came to me from the Lord: 
        <sup>2</sup> “Son of man, give your people this message: ‘When I bring an army against a country, the people of that land choose one of their own to be a watchman. 
        <sup>3</sup> When the watchman sees the enemy coming, he sounds the alarm to warn the people. 
        <sup>4</sup> Then if those who hear the alarm refuse to take action, it is their own fault if they die. 
        <sup>5</sup> They heard the alarm but ignored it, so the responsibility is theirs. If they had listened to the warning, they could have saved their lives. 
        <sup>6</sup> But if the watchman sees the enemy coming and doesn’t sound the alarm to warn the people, he is responsible for their captivity. They will die in their sins, but I will hold the watchman responsible for their deaths.’ 
        <sup>7</sup> “Now, son of man, I am making you a watchman for the people of Israel. Therefore, listen to what I say and warn them for me. 
        <sup>8</sup> If I announce that some wicked people are sure to die and you fail to tell them to change their ways, then they will die in their sins, and I will hold you responsible for their deaths. 
        <sup>9</sup> But if you warn them to repent and they don’t repent, they will die in their sins, but you will have saved yourself.

      <p><b>The Role of a Watchman: Understanding the Commisioned Role of Ezekiel</b><br><br>

        
        In the biblical narrative, the role of a watchman is a profound symbol of vigilance, responsibility, and spiritual accountability. This is especially evident in Ezekiel 33:1-9, where God appoints the prophet Ezekiel as a watchman over the house of Israel. This role was not merely a symbolic title but a solemn duty to convey God's messages to a people who had strayed from His commands through intentional sinning. This devotional verse will explore the significance of Ezekiel's commission as a watchman and its implications for modern spiritual leaders and believers today.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Context of Ezekiel's Commission</b><br><br>
        
        <b><i>Historical Background</i></b><br><br>
        
        Ezekiel lived during a pivotal and challenging period in Israel's history. The nation was in Babylonian exile, suffering the consequences of persistent disobedience and idolatry. It was a time of great spiritual and moral decline, and the people of Israel had become a rebellious house, turning away from God’s commandments.<br><br>
        
        Amidst this backdrop, God called Ezekiel to be a prophet and a watchman for His people. In ancient times, a watchman held a critical military position. Positioned on city walls or towers, watchmen were responsible for identifying potential threats and alerting the city's inhabitants. The failure of a watchman to sound the alarm could result in disaster for the city and severe punishment, including death, for the watchman himself. Similarly, Ezekiel’s role was to perceive spiritual dangers and warn the people of Israel of impending judgment if they did not repent from their sinful ways.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Spiritual Watchman</b><br><br>
        
        Unlike a traditional watchman who used physical senses to detect threats, Ezekiel was tasked with using spiritual discernment to perceive God’s messages. God instructed him to listen closely to His words and relay them to the people, regardless of their willingness to hear. <br><br>
        
        In Ezekiel 3:10-11, God emphasizes the importance of internalizing His words: <i>"Son of man, take into your heart all My words which I will speak to you and listen closely."</i><br><br>
        
        Ezekiel faced the challenge of speaking to a "rebellious house," a nation that had repeatedly rejected God's commands. Nevertheless, his duty was to warn them in hopes of turning them back to God. The people of Israel were not just any nation; they were God's chosen people, and He desired their repentance and restoration. As stated in Ezekiel 18:32, <i>"For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent and live!"</i> This highlights God’s deep compassion and desire for His people to return to Him.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Role of Modern-Day Watchmen</b><br><br>
        
        
        God continues to seek individuals who will stand as watchmen, proclaiming His word and urging repentance. Jeremiah 23:22 reflects this desire: <i>"But if they had stood in my council, they would have proclaimed my words to my people and would have turned them from their evil ways and from their evil deeds."</i> This call to be a watchman is not limited to spiritual leaders alone but extends to all believers who are part of the Kingdom of God.<br><br>
        
        In today’s world, the need for spiritual watchmen is more pressing than ever. Society grapples with moral and ethical challenges, and many contemporary religious teachings fall short of conveying the full message of God’s kingdom. Believers are called to rise as watchmen, sharing the truth of God’s Word and warning others of the consequences of sin and disobedience.<br><br>
        
        The role of a watchman is a significant responsibility for every believer who considers themselves part of God’s kingdom. This involves not only caring for our spiritual community but also extending God’s message to those who have yet to acknowledge Him as their God and King. Family members, friends, colleagues, and all those God places in our path are part of our responsibility to inform about the truth of God’s kingdom and the divine judgment awaiting those who refuse to repent and turn to Him.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        The role of a watchman, as exemplified by Ezekiel, is one of profound responsibility and commitment. Ezekiel was chosen to convey God's message to a rebellious nation, emphasizing the importance of repentance and divine love. This role is mirrored in the responsibilities of each believer in the Kingdom of God. Everyone who is part of the kingdom is tasked with sharing the truth and warning of the consequences of ignoring God’s commands.<br><br>
        
        As the coming of the Lord draws near, believers must remain vigilant, heeding God's word and standing firm against deception. The question remains: will you, as a believer, commit to being a watchman for God's people and for your nation, listening intently to His message and boldly proclaiming His truth meaning, will you courageously share the program of the Kingdom of God? <i>"Now as for you, son of man, I have appointed you a watchman for the house of Israel; so you will hear a message from My mouth and give them warning from Me."</i> (Ezekiel 33:7)<br><br>
        
        In these last days, let us rise to the challenge of being watchmen, standing in God’s council, and faithfully proclaiming His Word, turning people back from their evil ways, and guiding them towards the path of repentance and salvation. The call to be a watchman is a call to action, a call to love, and a call to fulfill the Great Commission entrusted to us by God.<br><br>
        
        All the truths you have learned from the program through the Word of God, along with the blessings, curses, and impending divine judgment, are now your responsibility, and you will be held accountable if you do not follow and share them.<br><br>
        
        As watchmen, it is our duty to inform everyone entrusted to us as our responsibility. We cannot choose whom to inform; we must not judge whether someone is good or bad, nor should we consider their religion. The Lord commands watchmen to give a warning. Everyone you know who is not yet in the Kingdom of God is your responsibility. Every person God brings into your life is your accountability, and you are responsible for their salvation and potential destruction. <br><br>
        
       <i> The downfall of a nation is the collective responsibility of those who have been enlightened by the truths of the Kingdom of God as revealed through His written Word. </i>
