      <p><b>The Prodigal's Son Older Brother</b><br><br>
        
        The parable of the Prodigal Son, found in Luke 15:25-32, is a well-known story in the Bible that illustrates themes of repentance, forgiveness, and grace. Most people are familiar with the younger son, who asks for his inheritance, squanders it in a distant land, and then returns home to his father's open arms. However, the story doesn't end there. The elder brother's role is equally significant and offers valuable insights into human nature, pride, and self-righteousness.<br><br>

        <b>The Context of the Parable</b><br><br>
        
        The parable begins with a younger son who demands his share of the inheritance, leaves home, and wastes his wealth on reckless living. When he finds himself destitute and envious of the food given to pigs, he decides to return to his father, hoping to be accepted as a servant. The father, filled with compassion, welcomes him back with open arms, celebrates his return, and orders a feast in his honor.<br><br>
        
        Meanwhile, the older son is working in the field. When he approaches the house and hears music and dancing, he becomes curious and asks a servant about the festivities. Upon learning that his younger brother has returned and is being celebrated, he becomes angry and refuses to join the celebration.<br><br>
        
       <b>The Sin of the Older Brother</b><br><br>
        
        On the surface, the older brother appears to be the obedient, faithful son who stayed with his father and worked hard. However, his reaction to his brother's return reveals deeper issues in his heart. He is angry, bitter, and resentful of his father's grace toward his wayward brother. The older brother's sin is one of self-righteousness and pride, which can be more insidious and dangerous than the reckless sin of the younger brother.<br><br>
        
        The elder brother's anger is rooted in his perception of injustice. He feels slighted that his years of service and obedience have not been rewarded in the same way his brother's return has been celebrated. He believes he deserves recognition and reward for his faithfulness, and he cannot comprehend his father's unconditional love and forgiveness.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Father's Response</b><br><br>
        
        The father, demonstrating remarkable patience and understanding, goes out to his older son and pleads with him to join the celebration. He reminds him that everything the father has is already his, and that the celebration is fitting because his brother was "dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found."<br><br>
        
        The father's response highlights the themes of grace and forgiveness that run throughout the parable. He does not rebuke his older son for his anger and pride but instead invites him to share in the joy of his brother's return. The father's love is not diminished by the elder son's resentment, just as it was not diminished by the younger son's rebellion.<br><br>
        
        <b>Lessons for Today</b><br><br>
        
        The parable of the Prodigal Son offers several important lessons, particularly through the character of the older brother. It challenges us to examine our own hearts for self-righteousness, pride and the way we are serving God. Like the older brother, we may be tempted to believe that our good deeds and faithfulness earn us special favor with God. However, the parable reminds us that God's love and grace are not earned but freely given.<br><br>
        
        <b><i>1. Self-Righteousness and Pride:</i></b> <br><br>
        
        The story of the older brother warns us of the dangers of self-righteousness. We can become so focused on our own perceived goodness that we fail to recognize our need for grace. The older brother's pride and sense of moral superiority blinded him to the joy of his brother's return and the depth of the father's love.<br><br>
        
        Are you like the older brother who believes you are part of the Kingdom of God just because you do your daily devotions? Yet, you do not actively participate in expanding His Kingdom. You don’t engage with fellow believers to strengthen each other and work together to spread God’s Kingdom.<br><br>
        
        Your self-pride might lead you to think that daily devotion is enough, but without action to demonstrate your faith, it falls short.<br><br>

        
        
        <b><i>2. Grace and Forgiveness:</i></b> <br><br>
        
        The father's response to both sons underscores the boundless grace and forgiveness available to all. The younger son's return is celebrated not because of his past actions but because of his repentance and the father's love. Similarly, the older son is invited to experience the same grace, despite his anger and pride.<br><br>
        
        Do we joyfully invite others to join us in studying the truths about God’s reign? Those truly part of God's Kingdom bear the burden of ensuring that all people receive His mercy and grace. We are called, chosen, forgiven, and restored by God so that we can become instruments to reach those around us, who also need to know God's goodness.<br><br>
        
        <b><i>3. Joy in Repentance:</i></b> <br><br>
        
        The parable encourages us to rejoice in the repentance and restoration of others. The older brother's inability to celebrate his brother's return reveals a lack of empathy and understanding of the father's love. We are called to share in the joy of others' transformation and redemption.<br><br>
        
        Do you feel joy when bringing souls into God's Kingdom? One of the proofs that God has accepted us and His Holy Spirit dwells in us is our determination to share with others the goodness He has done in our lives.<br><br>
        
        
        "If you have not yet experienced the salvation God offers, this may be the reason why you have not yet shared Him with others."<br><br>
        
        <i>
        Luke 9:26 (KJV) <br>
        “For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.”
        </i><br><br>
        
        Remember, if we persist in neglecting our responsibility to invite others to God, we will be accountable to Him for it. The only possible reason we might not be able to share God's word with others is that we have not yet received the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit guides us in fulfilling God's will and is the mark that identifies a believer as truly belonging to God, kept forever by His power.<br><br>
        
        <i>
        Ephesians 1:13-14 KJV <br>
        <sup>13</sup> In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 
        <sup>14</sup> which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
        </i><br><br>
        
        
        Examine yourself; you might be like the older brother who refuses to enter the house of his Father. And in the same way, we know that outside the Kingdom of God, judgment awaits those who remain there.<br><br>
        
        
        <b><i>4. Understanding God's Love:</i></b> <br><br>
        
        The parable challenges us to understand God's love as unconditional and inclusive. The father's love for both sons is unwavering, regardless of their actions. This reflects the nature of God's love for us, which is not based on our merit but on His grace.<br><br>
        
        Let us always consider God's love and what He has done for us, how we have experienced His grace and mercy. These are the same things everyone around us needs. Let’s act now and bring people to God, especially into His Kingdom. Use the Kingdom Chronicle program to help them understand God’s Kingdom and His reign here on Earth.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        The parable of the Prodigal Son, particularly the role of the older brother, offers profound insights into human nature and the transformative power of grace. It calls us to examine our own hearts for self-righteousness, pride, and how we are serving God. We are to embrace the boundless grace of God and to rejoice in being His instruments in the repentance and restoration of others.<br><br>
        
        As we reflect on this story, let us strive to embody the father's love and grace in our own lives, extending it to others and celebrating the transformative power of God's forgiveness.
