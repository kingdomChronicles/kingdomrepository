      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>Matthew 19:16-22</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle"> AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
                <p>
                    <sup>16</sup> And someone came to Him and said, “Teacher, what [essentially] good thing shall I do to obtain eternal life [that is, eternal salvation in the Messiah's kingdom]?” <br> <br>
                    <sup>17</sup> Jesus answered, “Why are you asking Me about what is [essentially] good? There is only One who is [essentially] good; but if you wish to enter into eternal life, keep the commandments.”  <br> <br>
                    <sup>18</sup> He said to Jesus, “Which commandments?” And Jesus answered, “You shall not commit murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not give false testimony; <br> <br>
                    <sup>19</sup> Honor your father and mother; and love your neighbor as yourself” [that is, unselfishly seek the best or higher good for others]. <br> <br>
                    <sup>20</sup> The young man said to Him, “I have kept all these things [from my youth]; what do I still lack?”  <br> <br>
                    <sup>21</sup> Jesus answered him, “If you wish to be perfect [that is, have the spiritual maturity that accompanies godly character with no moral or ethical deficiencies], go and sell what you have and give [the money] to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me [becoming My disciple, believing and trusting in Me and walking the same path of life that I walk].” <br> <br>
                    <sup>22</sup> But when the young man heard this, he left grieving and distressed, for he owned much property and had many possessions [which he treasured more than his relationship with God]. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><b><sup>16</sup> And someone came to Him and said, “Teacher, what [essentially] good thing shall I do to obtain eternal life [that is, eternal salvation in the Messiah's kingdom]?”</b> <br><br>
                    A serious and wealthy young man and a ruler have approached Jesus with a life-and-death question. He has asked what good deed he must do to have eternal life. The man is clearly a religious person and a faithful follower of Judaism. In the gospel of Luke, he is described as a ruler; some commentators speculate that he was a Pharisee or other religious leader in Israel. <br><br>
                    <b>He is young</b>, meaning he still has the strength to do the good things he needs to do. <br><br>
                    <b>Rich Man</b>: He has enough resources to be able to help people in need, as the law was written to guide us to do good deeds. <br><br>
                    <b>A Pharisee</b>, or religious leader, was serving the Lord based on the Law of Moses. He was also an expert on the law.
                </p> <br>

                <p>The man assumes that having an eternal life relies on actions, but why, even though He has the resources, authority, and knowledge to do the good things as per what the law has taught, there is something within his heart that is lacking? He was not sure of His salvation.</p> <br><br>

                <p><b><sup>17a</sup> Jesus answered, “Why are you asking Me about what is [essentially] good? There is only One who is [essentially] good;                </b> <br><br>
                    <b>"Why are you asking Me about what is [essentially] good?...</b>  As Jesus so often does, He answers the young man's question with a question of His own. He immediately challenges the assumption the man's question revealed. He asks why the young man asks Him about what is good. <br><br>
                   
                    Jesus insists there is only One who is good. That One is God. In a roundabout way, Jesus is asking the man, "Are you calling me God?" Jesus, as God's Son, is one with Him. He is God manifested in flesh.
                </p> <br><br>

                <p><b><sup>17b</sup> but if you wish to enter into eternal life, keep the commandments.”  
                <sup>18</sup> He said to Jesus, “Which commandments?” And Jesus answered, “You shall not commit murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not give false testimony; 
                <sup>19</sup> Honor your father and mother; and love your neighbor as yourself” [that is, unselfishly seek the best or higher good for others].</b><br><br>

                <b>Which commandments?</b>... This serious follower of Judaism wants to know how he can be sure that he will make it into the kingdom of heaven. The rich man's question shows he is not complacently believing that simply being Jewish will guarantee him a place in the Kingdom of heaven. </p> <br><br>


                <p><b><sup>20</sup> The young man said to Him, “I have kept all these things [from my youth]; what do I still lack?” </b> <br><br>
                    The man has said, proudly and blindly, that he has already kept those commandments. <br><br>
                    Are you also proud of God that you have a ministry, that you go to church, or that you give your offering? <br><br>
                   
                    Having a ministry in the church is not a guarantee of salvation, nor is it a guarantee of how many years you have been attending fellowship. It's also not a guarantee if you read the Bible but don't understand, meditate, and obey. Your money is also not a guarantee, even if you are one of those who give a large amount to the church; God cannot be bribed. <br><br>

                    How much worse is the condition of those who do not have a ministry or do not care about the work of the Lord? How much more are those who do not want to open the bible (His word)? <br><br>

                    How much more the people who go to church, but it's normal to commit repeated sins such as lying, being selfish, and causing division, and it's okay to feel angry with the people around them, unforgiving, and all others who are considered by the scripture sin and not good in the eyes of the Lord. <br><br>

                    Do we also ask the Lord how to truly gain salvation? Just like him, who is doing everything he knows is good because he wants to enter the Kingdom of God,. <br><br>

                    Are you also asking this question? Or has the enemy deceived you into believing that even though your life and your activities are contrary to the word of God, you still believe that you are saved and that you can enter the Kingdom of God?
                </p> <br><br>

                <p><b><sup>21</sup> Jesus answered him, “If you wish to be perfect [that is, have the spiritual maturity that accompanies godly character with no moral or ethical deficiencies], go and sell what you have and give [the money] to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me [becoming My disciple, believing and trusting in Me and walking the same path of life that I walk].” </b> <br><br>
                    The purpose of this comment is to expose the blindness of this wealthy young man and his ultimate lack of sincerity. The man believed—or wanted to believe—that he had already loved his neighbor as himself. Jesus showed that it was not true because the man still had great wealth, and his neighbors were still poor. The young man was not perfectly good, after all. <br><br>
                   
                    There are two points to this comment by Jesus. One is immediately clear; the other comes to light when the rich man reacts to Jesus' advice. <br><br>

                    First, this demonstrates that nobody is good enough to be guaranteed eternal life with God in heaven. <br><br>

                    The gospel of Jesus Christ is that He is the only one good enough to die to pay for our sin and to cover our lack of goodness with His perfect goodness. Only by faith in Jesus and through God's grace and power can anyone be saved. As much as we might hope we've been "good enough," we can't live up to God's standard of perfection. <br><br>

                    The second and most immediate purpose of Jesus' words in this verse is shown in the following verse. When pushed to follow God—to pursue "good"—the rich man only shows his refusal.
                </p> <br><br>

                <p><b><sup>22</sup> But when the young man heard this, he left grieving and distressed, for he owned much property and had many possessions [which he treasured more than his relationship with God]. </b> <br><br>

                    His reaction proves that he is ultimately unwilling to follow God unless God does things the rich man's way. <br><br>

                    Christ demonstrated to this man that he could not be good enough to have eternal life on his own. He will need to receive Jesus' goodness so he can have eternal life. <br><br>

                    <b>Conclusion:</b><br><br>

                    What kind of obedience do you want from God? Do you want to be the one being followed, and are you the one to choose the way or what type of obedience you want to give God? You are not worthy of salvation if that is how you want to serve God. God can't help you if you are the one to be followed and the one to give direction. Are you better than God? Are you smarter than God? God knows everything, and our only part is to believe and follow His way. <br><br>

                    The most important thing right now is that we admit that there is still something lacking and missing and that we should possess a teachable heart so that God can teach us the true way of salvation. <br><br>
                    
                    A person who is saved knows the feeling of true salvation.  <br><br>
                    
                    Never pretend or foolishly think you already have salvation. Compare yourself with what His Word says. You must be sure of your salvation by obeying God with all your heart, soul, strength, and your whole being. If you realize one day that you aren't truly saved, it will be too late. <br><br> 

                    Don't deceive yourself; the evidence of your salvation should be seen in your lifestyle and in how you care about the things of God. Is the fruit of your salvation reflected in your daily life? Do you care about expanding God's Kingdom? Are you bringing souls to His Kingdom? Do you support the needs of God's Kingdom on earth?<br><br>
                    
                    If you humble yourself and fully submit your life to His will, God will show you the right path to salvation and the perfect obedience that His Son exemplified while He was on earth. The question is, are you willing?
