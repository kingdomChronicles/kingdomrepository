          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

          <h2>Psalms 40:2</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
          <p> 
            <sup>2</sup> He brought me up out of a horrible pit [of tumult and of destruction], out of the miry clay, And He set my feet upon a rock, steadying my footsteps and establishing my path. 
          </p>

          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>
    

          <p>Read Genesis 37:12-28, before continuing your devotion. <br><br>

            The patriarch Joseph literally faced the disaster of being thrown into a pit. His brothers hated him and tried to get rid of him by putting him in the pit. However, in God's plan, Judah, one of the brothers, convinced the others to pull him out of the pit and sell him to a caravan of Ishmaelites headed for Egypt. The brothers received twenty shekels of silver from the traders.<br><br>
            
            
            For King David, no part of the scripture records any literal events of him being trapped in a pit. Instead, this is additional poetry describing how deeply desperate David's situation was. David's life was filled with near-death experiences that seemed as hopeless as being stuck in a trash pit or a slimy swamp. One can imagine being abandoned in a deep hole filling with water, mud, and slime. <br><br>
            
            In such a situation, it is impossible to get a foothold, but the Lord reached down to David, answered his cry for help, and pulled him to safety. David says the Lord set his feet on a rock and made his steps secure. This imagery shows that the Lord rescued David from his enemies and provided security for him. <br><br>
            
            From being a little shepherd boy on the hills of Bethlehem, David demonstrated a life dedicated to the Lord. He was a man after God's own heart, whose patient endurance and trusting faith brought him deliverance, encouragement, hope, and salvation. <br><br>
            
            His rescue from the pit of destruction and release from the slimy clay reminds us of the terrible suffering of Joseph as we have just read, whose brothers threw him into a deep pit before selling him as a slave to passing Midianite traders. His fate also reminds us of men like Job and Jeremiah, who both faced terrible trials similar to those David endured as he sought the Lord. <br><br>
            
            Perhaps the person who sank into the deepest pit of destruction and whose patient endurance surpasses all others is our Savior, Jesus Christ. His trust in His Father never failed, despite the cesspool of sin He willingly sank into when crucified on a Roman cross so that we might be raised up from our pit of destruction into eternal life by faith in Him. <br><br>
            
            Jesus waited patiently for God as He hung on Calvary's tree, bearing the weight of the world's sin on His sinless shoulders. Although the Father turned away from His beloved Son as He became sin for us, the Lord inclined His ear, heard His cry, and brought Him up from the terrible pit of destruction and the miry clay so that He could become the rock of our salvation on which we can stand firm, through time and into eternity. <br><br>
            
            If we take our devotion seriously and walk daily in perfect communion with God, we can now experience how He rescued us from the pit of death and destruction and set our feet on the solid rock found in Jesus, our King, and our God. Our future is secured if we have seen His salvation in our lives. <br><br>
            
            
            No matter what pit of suffering and shame we may endure, and no matter how deeply we sink into the quicksand of destruction, we have His assurance that He will set our feet back on the rock of our salvation and establish our goings out and our comings in, from now and forevermore. <br><br>
            
            Let's continue our journey with our King, with our God, and let Him complete His work in our lives until we can stand firmly in front of the enemy and declare, "I am now secure with my King, my Lord, and my God in His Kingdom forevermore." <br><br>

            <p><b>My Prayer </b> <br>
                Heavenly Father, thank You for rescuing me from the pit of destruction and the oppressive miry clay. Your hand of blessing and encouragement has reached down to raise me up and set my feet upon the rock of my salvation, Jesus. Help me to wait patiently as You continue to teach me to walk in Your ways. Your Kingdom ways. In Jesus name. Amen.
                </p>
