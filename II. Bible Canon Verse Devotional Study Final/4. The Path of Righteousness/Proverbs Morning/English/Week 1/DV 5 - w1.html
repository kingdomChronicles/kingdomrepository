        <h2>Proverbs 5:7</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NKJV (New King James Version)</p>
          

        <p><sup>7</sup> "Therefore hear me now, my children, And do not depart from the words of my mouth."</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Call to Heed Wisdom</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 5:7, "Therefore hear me now, my children, and do not depart from the words of my mouth," is a heartfelt plea from Solomon to his students or followers, urging them to embrace and remain steadfast in wisdom. The use of “my children” reflects the nurturing relationship between a teacher and learners, emphasizing the care and responsibility a mentor feels in imparting life-changing guidance. However, the ultimate responsibility for living out this wisdom lies with each individual. <br><br>

        Solomon’s appeal underscores the importance of listening attentively and applying godly counsel. While parents and teachers can provide wisdom and direction, it is up to each person to integrate these lessons into their lives. The decisions made by the listener will determine whether they walk the path of righteousness or stray into destruction. This highlights the principle of personal accountability: we are each responsible for how we respond to truth and instruction.<br><br>
        
        Timothy serves as a model of someone who faithfully embraced the wisdom and teaching given to him during his formative years. Paul, in his letters, commends Timothy for the sincere faith passed down from his grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Timothy 1:5 NLT</b><br>
        I remember your genuine faith, for you share the faith that first filled your grandmother Lois and your mother, Eunice. And I know that same faith continues strong in you.</i><br><br>
        
        Timothy’s early exposure to Scripture shaped his character, grounding him in a faith that endured and empowered him to serve God throughout his life.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Timothy 3:14-15 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>14</sup> But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it <sup>15</sup> and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. </i><br><br>
        
        Paul’s reminder further emphasizes the value of holding fast to the truths learned from childhood, particularly the Scriptures that lead to salvation through faith in Christ.<br><br>
        
        This call to heed wisdom is as relevant today as it was in Solomon’s time. In a world filled with competing voices and distractions, the temptation to depart from godly counsel is strong. Many people neglect the timeless truths of Scripture, opting instead to follow fleeting trends or worldly philosophies. Yet the wisdom found in God’s Word is unchanging, providing guidance, protection, and purpose for those who choose to follow it.<br><br>
        
        Proverbs 5:7 challenges us to listen carefully to the wisdom we receive from godly mentors, teachers, and, most importantly, Scripture. It calls us to not only hear but also to hold firmly to these truths, making them the foundation of our lives. Like Timothy, we are encouraged to honor the godly teaching we have received and to continue walking in the path of faith and righteousness. In doing so, we align ourselves with God’s will and experience the abundant life He desires for us.
