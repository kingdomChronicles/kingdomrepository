        <h2>Proverbs 5:4</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p><sup>4</sup> "But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as dangerous as a double-edged sword."</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Bitter Consequences of Sin</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 5:4, "But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as dangerous as a double-edged sword," provides a sobering insight into the ultimate consequences of sin, particularly adultery. While sin often presents itself as sweet and alluring, its true nature is revealed in its aftermath—bitterness, pain, and destruction. This verse serves as a powerful warning that the promises of temptation never deliver lasting satisfaction, but instead lead to profound regret and harm. <br><br>

        The comparison to poison and a double-edged sword highlights the deceptive nature of sin. Poison, once consumed, spreads harm internally, representing the emotional and spiritual damage caused by giving in to temptation. Adultery, which may initially seem thrilling or fulfilling, eventually poisons the soul with guilt, shame, and brokenness. Similarly, the imagery of a double-edged sword signifies danger and destruction. This weapon cuts deeply, symbolizing the severe consequences of adultery—not only the personal guilt but also the damage inflicted on relationships, families, and reputations.<br><br>
        
        The reference to bitterness recalls the plant wormwood, known for its intensely bitter taste and association with calamity and judgment. In biblical symbolism, wormwood often represents the painful consequences of sin. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Revelation 8:10-11 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>10</sup> The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. <sup>11</sup> The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the water, because it had been made bitter.</i><br><br>
        
        For example, a star that is named Wormwood that poisons the waters, leading to widespread death. Just as the sweetness of temptation turns bitter, so does the fleeting pleasure of sin transform into lasting suffering.<br><br>
        
        Adultery's consequences are not only emotional but also far-reaching. The pain of betrayal impacts spouses, children, and communities. Trust is shattered, and reputations are tarnished. In some cases, health may also be affected, whether through stress or physical consequences. These outcomes illustrate the destructive nature of sin, which promises fleeting pleasure but delivers enduring agony.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Hebrews 4:12 NKJV</b><br>
        For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. </i><br><br>
        
        The metaphor of the double-edged sword  where God's Word is described as sharper than any sword, capable of discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. While the truth of Scripture separates right from wrong, the consequences of adultery deeply sever trust, peace, and integrity. The sharp sting of guilt and the awareness of wrongdoing are reminders of how sin separates us from God and others.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 5:4 calls us to reject the temporary allure of sin and to pursue righteousness. The sweet words of temptation mask the bitterness of its consequences. By clinging to God's Word and wisdom, we can discern the truth and avoid the destructive paths that lead to bitterness and pain. True satisfaction is found not in fleeting pleasures but in faithful obedience to God, which leads to lasting peace and joy.
