        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Wisdom of Guarding Your Commitments - Series Reflection on Proverbs 6:2-5 (1/4)</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 6:2 warns us about the consequences of making careless commitments, particularly in financial matters. Solomon’s advice is both practical and timeless, as it addresses a scenario many people face: making a promise or agreement in haste and then finding themselves bound by it in an unfavorable situation. <br><br>

        In this verse, Solomon highlights the danger of becoming entangled in agreements, such as cosigning for another person’s loan. This might seem like an act of kindness or support, but it often carries significant risks. The context of Proverbs suggests that such situations frequently arise in connection with unwise borrowing or lending practices, including excessive interest rates or unreliable borrowers. While cosigning itself is not inherently wrong, Solomon cautions against making agreements that could lead to financial ruin or unnecessary stress.<br><br>
        
        Even today, the wisdom of this verse applies. Many people have experienced the difficulty of cosigning a loan, only to find later that the borrower cannot fulfill their obligation. Whether it’s a loan for a car, tuition, or another expense, the cosigner becomes responsible for the payments when the borrower defaults. This leaves the cosigner "trapped" by the promise they made, regretting their decision as they shoulder the burden of a high-interest loan.<br><br>
        
        Shakespeare’s famous line, “Neither a borrower nor a lender be,” spoken by Polonius in Hamlet, echoes a similar sentiment. However, the Bible does not forbid borrowing or lending outright. Instead, it warns against the sinful practices of charging exorbitant interest or entering agreements carelessly. Lending or borrowing is not wrong in itself, but it must be done with wisdom, caution, and a clear understanding of the potential consequences.<br><br>
        
        This verse challenges us to take our words and commitments seriously. If we find ourselves trapped by an unwise agreement, the Bible advises swift action to resolve the situation, as outlined in the verses that follow. <br><br> 
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 6:3-5 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>3</sup> follow my advice and save yourself, for you have placed yourself at your friend’s mercy. Now swallow your pride; go and beg to have your name erased. <sup>4</sup> Don’t put it off; do it now! Don’t rest until you do. <sup>5</sup> Save yourself like a gazelle escaping from a hunter, like a bird fleeing from a net.</i><br><br>
        
        We must approach such situations with humility, seek to rectify the issue, and learn from the experience.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 6:2 reminds us to think carefully before making promises, particularly in financial matters. A thoughtful approach to our commitments can spare us unnecessary hardships and allow us to act with integrity, wisdom, and responsibility. In all things, seeking God’s guidance and exercising discernment will help us avoid the pitfalls of rash agreements and protect us from being "caught by what we said."
