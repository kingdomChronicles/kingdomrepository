        <h2>Proverbs 6:1</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Traslation)</p>
          

        <p>
          <sup>1</sup> My child, if you have put up security for a friend’s debtor agreed to guarantee the debt of a stranger
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Danger of Guaranteeing Debts</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 6:1 states, “My child, if you have put up security for a friend’s debt or agreed to guarantee the debt of a stranger…” This verse introduces a cautionary lesson about the dangers of financial agreements that bind one’s resources to another person’s reliability. While the Bible encourages generosity and helping those in need, it also warns against unwise commitments that could lead to personal ruin. <br><br>

        In the Old Testament, lending money to fellow Israelites was encouraged as a way to alleviate distress and demonstrate compassion. However, this generosity was to be governed by fairness and mercy. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Exodus 22:25 NLT</b><br>
        “If you lend money to any of my people who are in need, do not charge interest as a money lender would. </i><br><br>
        
        The verse explicitly forbids charging interest on loans to the poor, emphasizing that lending was meant to be an act of kindness rather than an opportunity for profit. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Exodo 22:26 MBBTAG12</b><br>
        Kapag may nagsanla sa inyo ng balabal, ibalik ninyo iyon sa kanya bago lumubog ang araw </i><br><br>
        
        Additionally, Exodus 22:26 commands lenders to return a neighbor’s cloak taken as collateral by nightfall, recognizing the borrower’s need for warmth and protection. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Leviticus 25:35-37 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>35</sup> “If one of your fellow Israelites falls into poverty and cannot support himself, support him as you would a foreigner or a temporary resident and allow him to live with you. <sup>36</sup> Do not charge interest or make a profit at his expense. Instead, show your fear of God by letting him live with you as your relative. <sup>37</sup> Remember, do not charge interest on money you lend him or make a profit on food you sell him. </i><br><br>
        
        Leviticus 25:35–37 reinforces these principles, prohibiting exploitation and interest on loans within the Israelite community. These guidelines reflect God’s heart for justice and mercy in financial dealings.<br><br>
        
        Proverbs 6:1 specifically addresses the act of “putting up security” or becoming a cosigner for another’s debt. This involves agreeing to take responsibility for someone else’s financial obligation if they fail to repay it. While this might seem like an act of kindness, it carries significant risk. The borrower’s financial irresponsibility or inability to repay can result in the guarantor losing their own wealth. The warning here is not against all forms of borrowing or lending but against the unwise entanglement of one’s resources with the unpredictable behavior of others.<br><br>
        
        The Bible’s wisdom regarding financial stewardship emphasizes prudence and discernment. Becoming a guarantor for a debt exposes a person to potential financial hardship and disrupts their ability to manage their own obligations. This is especially true when the borrower is a stranger or someone whose reliability is uncertain. By tying one’s finances to another person’s choices, the guarantor places themselves in a vulnerable position, potentially jeopardizing their stability and peace of mind.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 6:1 serves as a reminder to approach financial decisions with caution and wisdom. While generosity and helping others are virtuous, they must be balanced with responsibility and foresight. Reckless financial commitments can lead to unnecessary stress and hardship, undermining the very intention of helping others. Instead, the Bible encourages believers to give freely and wisely, trusting God to provide for their needs while avoiding entanglements that could lead to harm.<br><br>
        
        In reflecting on this verse, we are reminded of the importance of aligning our financial decisions with God’s principles of justice, mercy, and wisdom. Let us strive to be good stewards of the resources entrusted to us, helping others in ways that reflect God’s love while maintaining the prudence and discernment that honor Him.
