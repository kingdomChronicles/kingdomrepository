        <h2>Proverbs 5:23</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NKJV (New King James Version)</p>
          

        <p>
          <sup>23</sup> He shall die for lack of instruction, And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
        </p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Consequences of Undisciplined Living</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 5:23 warns, "He shall die for lack of instruction, and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray." This verse emphasizes the severe consequences of ignoring wisdom and discipline. It paints a sobering picture of a life consumed by folly, one that ultimately leads to destruction—physically, mentally, and spiritually. <br><br>

        An undisciplined person, one who rejects good teaching and correction, sets himself on a path of ruin. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 5:11-13 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>11</sup> and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed, <sup>12</sup> and you say, “How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof! <sup>13</sup> I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.
        </i><br><br>
        
        Proverbs 5:11–13 describes such an individual lamenting in regret, realizing too late the consequences of disregarding wisdom. Discipline serves as a safeguard, guiding a person to live a healthy and upright life. Without it, a person is left vulnerable to the consequences of sinful choices, which often result in suffering and even premature death.Proverbs 14:12 echoes this warning: <br><br>

        <i><b>Proverbs 14:12 ESV</b><br>
        There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.</i><br><br>

        Beyond physical consequences, Proverbs 5:23 highlights the spiritual danger of rejecting discipline. The Hebrew word for "led astray" also carries the meaning of being "captivated" or "ensnared." Foolishness captivates those who abandon wisdom, leading them to pursue whatever their sinful desires dictate. By indulging in sin, the undisciplined person wanders further from the truth, often finding it difficult—or even impossible—to return.<br><br>
        
        Solomon’s warning is both practical and spiritual. Practically, a disciplined life promotes health, stability, and joy. Spiritually, discipline keeps a person close to God, aligned with His will and protected from the snares of sin. Those who reject correction and instruction, however, drift into a life of chaos and suffering, risking eternal separation from God.<br><br>
        
        Proverbs 5:23 serves as a wake-up call to all who might be tempted to ignore wisdom. It reminds us of the value of discipline and the dangers of unchecked folly. By seeking instruction and embracing God’s guidance, we can avoid the path of destruction and instead walk in the way of life. Let us, therefore, remain attentive to God’s Word, allowing it to shape our lives and lead us toward righteousness.
