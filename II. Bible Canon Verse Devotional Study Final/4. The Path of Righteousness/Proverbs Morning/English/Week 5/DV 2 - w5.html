            <sup>12</sup> A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,
            <sup>13</sup>  winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger,
            <sup>14</sup> with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord;
            <sup>15</sup> therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.</i>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Danger of "A Little" Laziness</b></p>

        <p> This verse serves as a cautionary warning against laziness, showing how even small, seemingly harmless habits can lead to destruction. Solomon, the wisest man in Israel, highlights how the temptation to rest "a little more" can grow into a pattern of irresponsibility. What starts as brief moments of delay can eventually lead to a lifetime of wasted opportunities. The consequences of this mindset are vividly described in the next verse: <br><br>

        <i><b>Proverbs 6:11 ESV</b><br>
        and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.</i><br><br>
        
        Just as a thief strikes unexpectedly, so does the downfall of those who neglect their responsibilities.<br><br>
        
        This passage follows the contrast between the lazy person and the diligent ant. The ant instinctively prepares for the future, working tirelessly without needing supervision. In contrast, the lazy person indulges in moments of ease, falsely assuming they can make up for lost time later. However, life does not always grant second chances. When trials come, the unprepared suffer the consequences.<br><br>
        
        The principle of preparedness is not only relevant in financial matters but also in spiritual life. Jesus Himself warned against spiritual complacency. In the Garden of Gethsemane, He instructed His disciples to stay awake and pray, but they repeatedly fell asleep. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 26:36-38 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>36</sup> Then Jesus went with them to the olive grove called Gethsemane, and he said, “Sit here while I go over there to pray.” <sup>37</sup> He took Peter and Zebedee’s two sons, James and John, and he became anguished and distressed. <sup>38</sup> He told them, “My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”</i><br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 26:39-41 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>39</sup> He went on a little farther and bowed with his face to the ground, praying, “My Father! If it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine.” <sup>40</sup> Then he returned to the disciples and found them asleep. He said to Peter, “Couldn’t you watch with me even one hour? <sup>41</sup> Keep watch and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak!”</i><br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 26:42-43 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>42</sup> Then Jesus left them a second time and prayed, “My Father! If this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, your will be done.” <sup>43</sup> When he returned to them again, he found them sleeping, for they couldn’t keep their eyes open.</i><br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 26:44-46 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>44</sup> So he went to pray a third time, saying the same things again. <sup>45</sup> Then he came to the disciples and said, “Go ahead and sleep. Have your rest. But look—the time has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <sup>46</sup> Up, let’s be going. Look, my betrayer is here!” </i><br><br>
        
        Their failure to watch and pray left them unprepared for the coming trial—Peter, who had confidently pledged loyalty to Jesus, soon denied Him three times. This tragic moment reveals that spiritual laziness can be just as dangerous as physical laziness, leading to moments of weakness in times of crisis.<br><br>
        
        As believers, we are called to be vigilant, both in our work and in our faith. A little compromise today can become a stronghold of failure tomorrow. We must guard against the subtle lure of procrastination and instead embrace diligence, discipline, and a heart that seeks after God. Life’s challenges will come, but those who prepare wisely—both materially and spiritually—will be ready when the storm arrives.
