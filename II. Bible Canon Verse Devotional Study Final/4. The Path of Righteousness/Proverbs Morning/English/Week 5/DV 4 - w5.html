        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:9-15 (4/7)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Deception of the Wicked</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 6:12 warns about a specific kind of person—one who is described as "worthless" and "wicked." These terms are not merely insults but reflections of the person’s character, shaped by their actions. The primary focus of this verse is the deceptive nature of such individuals, particularly their use of crooked speech. In modern terms, we might refer to such a person as a scammer, con-artist, or manipulator. Their words are not used to build others up but to deceive, mislead, and ultimately harm. <br><br>

        <b>The Ultimate Source of Deception</b><br><br>
        
        Deception has its roots in darkness, and the Bible identifies Satan as the ultimate deceiver. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 8:44 ESV</b><br>
        You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies. </i><br><br>
        
        From the very beginning, the Devil’s goal has been to lead humanity astray. In the Garden of Eden, he deceived Eve by directly contradicting God’s warning. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Genesis 3:4 ESV</b><br>
        But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. </i><br><br>
        
        
        This act of deception led to humanity’s fall, demonstrating the devastating power of crooked speech.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Danger of Following Deception</b><br><br>
        
        The Bible repeatedly warns against falling prey to deceptive words. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 Timothy 4:1-2 AMP</b><br>
        <sup>1</sup> But the Holy Spirit explicitly and unmistakably declares that in later times some will turn away from the faith, paying attention instead to deceitful and seductive spirits and doctrines of demons, <sup>2</sup> [misled] by the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared as with a branding iron [leaving them incapable of ethical functioning], </i><br><br>
        
        The scripture predicts a time when some will turn away from true faith, led astray by false teachers who distort the truth. This shows that deception is not always obvious—it can come through seemingly wise or persuasive words. However, the end of all deception is certain. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Revelation 20:1-3 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>1</sup> Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain. <sup>2</sup> And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, <sup>3</sup> and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be released for a little while.</i><br><br>
        
        Revelation 20:1–3 reveals that at the beginning of Christ’s millennial reign, Satan will be bound and cast into the bottomless pit, preventing him from deceiving the nations any longer.<br><br>
        
        <b>Walking in Truth</b><br><br>
        
        As followers of Christ, we are called to be people of truth, avoiding both deceitful speech and those who spread lies. Proverbs 6:12 serves as a reminder to examine not only the words of others but also our own. Are we using our words to speak life, truth, and righteousness, or are we allowing deception to take root in our hearts? In a world full of lies, choosing to walk in truth is both a challenge and a calling—one that reflects the character of Christ rather than the deception of the wicked.
