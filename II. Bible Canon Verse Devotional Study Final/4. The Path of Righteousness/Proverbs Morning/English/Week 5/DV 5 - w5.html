        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:9-15 (5/7)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Deceptive Signals of the Wicked</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 6:13 warns about the subtle but dangerous signals of a deceitful person: "winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger." These seemingly harmless gestures, in the context of Solomon’s warning, reveal a deeper truth about human deception. The worthless person described in the previous verse (Proverbs 6:12) does not openly declare his wickedness but instead communicates his intentions through covert signals. His actions are carefully calculated to manipulate, deceive, and ultimately bring harm to his unsuspecting victims. <br><br>

        In modern times, people often associate "winking" with playful gestures or secretive communication. However, in the Hebrew context, the term qō'rēs refers to a deliberate motion, like a pinching or squeezing of the eyes, signaling deceit. This aligns with the way con artists, criminals, and frauds use coded signs to communicate without being detected. These secret signals enable them to coordinate schemes while keeping their victims unaware until it is too late. <br><br>
        
        The Bible reinforces this theme of deception in several other passages. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalm 35:19 ESV</b><br>
        Let not those rejoice over me who are wrongfully my foes, and let not those wink the eye who hate me without cause.</i><br><br>
        
        David prays against those who "wink the eye" in hatred, illustrating how such gestures can symbolize malicious intent. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 10:10 ESV</b><br>
        Whoever winks the eye causes trouble, and a babbling fool will come to ruin.<br><br>
        
        <b>Proverbs 16:30 ESV</b><br>
        Whoever winks his eyes plans dishonest things; he who purses his lips brings evil to pass.</i><br><br>
        
        Proverbs 10:10 and 16:30 further emphasize that those who wink with their eyes are planning dishonesty and causing trouble. These warnings highlight the reality that evil often operates in subtle ways, rather than in open confrontation.<br><br>
        
        This verse serves as a reminder for believers to be discerning. The enemy of righteousness rarely works through obvious means. Instead, deception comes through hidden gestures, misleading words, and calculated actions. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 10:16 ESV</b><br>
        “Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. </i><br><br>
        
        As Jesus advised in Matthew 10:16, we are to be "wise as serpents and innocent as doves," ensuring that we do not fall prey to the tricks of the wicked. By staying alert and seeking God's wisdom, we can recognize deception and walk steadfastly in the path of righteousness.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 6:13 is not just about identifying the wicked but also about cultivating wisdom and integrity in our own lives. We must guard our hearts against deceit and be cautious of those who operate in secrecy, ensuring that our own actions reflect truth, honesty, and godliness in all we do.
