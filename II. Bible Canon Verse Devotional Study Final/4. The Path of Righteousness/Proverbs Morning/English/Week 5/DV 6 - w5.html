        <h2>Proverbs 6:9-15</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <i><sup>9</sup> How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?<sup>10</sup> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,<sup>11</sup> and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.
            <sup>12</sup> A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,
            <sup>13</sup>  winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger,
            </i><b><sup>14</sup> with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord;
            </b><i><sup>15</sup> therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.</i>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:9-15 (6/7)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Perverted Heart: A Source of Evil and Discord</b></p>

        <p> The book of Proverbs provides timeless wisdom about the nature of wickedness, and Proverbs 6:14 reveals the heart of a person who continually plots evil and sows discord. A person with a perverted heart is not merely someone who commits sin occasionally but one who intentionally devises wicked schemes. Their actions result in division, strife, and destruction. <br><br>

        The Bible often warns against those who stir up discord, highlighting the dangerous effects of their actions. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 6:12-13 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>12</sup> A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech, <sup>13</sup>  winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger,</i><br><br>
        
        Proverbs 6:12–13 describes such a person as deceitful and corrupt, using subtle signals to manipulate others. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Jeremiah 17:9 ESV</b><br>
        The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?</i><br><br>
        
        When someone’s heart is turned away from God, their thoughts become self-serving, and their words and actions bring conflict rather than peace.<br><br>
        
        <b>Biblical Examples of Discord Sowers</b><br><br>
        
        One clear example of a person who sowed discord is Diotrephes.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>3 John 1:9-10 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>9</sup>I have written something to the church, but Diotrephes, who likes to put himself first, does not acknowledge our authority. <sup>10</sup> So if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, talking wicked nonsense against us. And not content with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers, and also stops those who want to and puts them out of the church.</i><br><br>
        
        The apostle John condemns him for rejecting authority, speaking maliciously, and driving faithful believers away from the church. Diotrephes was not just mistaken in his actions—he actively worked against the unity of the body of Christ. His pride and self-interest caused division, making him a direct threat to the church’s mission.<br><br>
        
        Another example is Alexander the coppersmith.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Timothy 4:14-15 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>14</sup> Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds. <sup>15</sup> Beware of him yourself, for he strongly opposed our message.</i><br><br>
        
        Paul states that Alexander "did me great harm" and urges believers to be cautious, as Alexander strongly opposed the message of Christ. Like Diotrephes, he became an obstacle to God's work, creating division where there should have been unity.<br><br>
        
        These biblical examples serve as warnings that such people have always existed—and still do today. In churches, workplaces, families, and communities, there are those who plant seeds of discord, hoping to see conflict and destruction take root.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Consequences of Sowing Discord</b><br><br>
        
        The act of sowing discord is likened to planting seeds with the intent of reaping destruction. Instead of promoting peace, love, and unity, these individuals cultivate hatred, suspicion, and division. Their actions can weaken relationships, destroy trust, and ultimately hinder the work of God's kingdom.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 6:16-19 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>16</sup> There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: <sup>17</sup>  haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, <sup>18</sup>  a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, <sup>19</sup>  a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers. </i><br><br>
        
        The Bible is clear about God's view on such behavior. Proverbs 6:16–19 lists "sowing discord among brothers" as one of the seven things the Lord hates. This shows the seriousness of this sin—it is not just a minor character flaw but something that directly opposes God’s desire for harmony among His people.<br><br>
        
        <b>Overcoming Discord with Godly Wisdom</b><br><br>
        
        In contrast to those who sow discord, believers are called to be peacemakers. Jesus said:<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 5:9 ESV</b><br>
        “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</i><br><br>
        
        Rather than stirring up strife, we should strive to build unity, encourage love, and seek reconciliation when conflicts arise.<br><br>
        
        The best way to guard against a perverted heart is to surrender fully to God. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalm 51:10 ESV</b><br>
        Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.</i><br><br>
        
        When our hearts are aligned with God’s will, we will seek to edify rather than destroy, to bring peace rather than division.<br><br>
        
        In a world filled with conflict and division, Christians must stand as lights of unity and love. Instead of allowing discord to take root, we should be vigilant in protecting the unity of our faith communities, families, and relationships. By doing so, we reflect the heart of Christ and advance the work of His kingdom.
