        <h2>Proverbs 5:13</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
          

        <p><sup>14</sup> "And I was soon in serious trouble in the assembly of God’s people."</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Consequences of Sin and the Justice of Christ</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 5:14 declares, "And I was soon in serious trouble in the assembly of God’s people." This verse captures the profound regret and shame experienced by someone who has fallen into sin, specifically the sin of adultery. Solomon warns of the devastating consequences of sin: a loss of reputation, honor, and standing within the community of God’s people. Adultery, like other sins, promises fleeting pleasure but ultimately brings ruin and judgment. <br><br>

        In the ancient context, this "serious trouble" could refer to public shame or even capital punishment, as prescribed in the Law of Moses. The sinner would face the judgment of the community, standing in the assembly of God’s people as a cautionary example of the dangers of violating God's commandments. This image is not only literal but also deeply symbolic, pointing to the ultimate judgment that awaits all humanity before the throne of Christ.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Shame of Sin</b><br><br>
        
        Adultery brings not only private guilt but also public disgrace. Even in today’s permissive culture, adultery is met with condemnation and stigma, highlighting its destructive nature. It violates the sacred covenant of marriage, betrays trust, and harms families. The sinner may feel exposed and vulnerable in the "assembly of God’s people," a place where righteousness and accountability are upheld.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 8:4-6 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>4</sup> they said to him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. <sup>5</sup> Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?” <sup>6</sup> This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. <br><br>
        
        <b>John 8:7-11 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>7</sup> And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.” <sup>8</sup> And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground. <sup>9</sup> But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. <sup>10</sup> Jesus stood up and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?” <sup>11</sup> She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.” </i><br><br>
        
        This public exposure echoes the story of the woman caught in adultery. Her accusers brought her to Jesus, demanding justice according to the Law. Yet, Jesus demonstrated the perfect balance of justice and mercy. He challenged her accusers, saying, “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her”. Convicted by their own sinfulness, they left one by one, leaving the woman alone with Jesus. While He did not condone her sin, Jesus extended grace, saying, “Go, and sin no more”.<br><br>
        
        This moment reminds us that while sin brings shame, God’s grace offers redemption. However, redemption requires repentance. The woman was called to leave her life of sin and walk in obedience to God’s ways.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Judgment of Christ</b><br><br>
        
        While grace is freely given, it does not negate the reality of judgment. Proverbs 5:14 foreshadows the ultimate judgment when all sinners will stand before Christ. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 25:31-32 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>31</sup>  “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. <sup>32</sup> Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. <br><br>
        
        <b>Matthew 25:33-40 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>33</sup> And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. <sup>34</sup> Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. <sup>35</sup> For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, <sup>36</sup> I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ <sup>37</sup> Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? <sup>38</sup> And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? <sup>39</sup> And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ <sup>40</sup> And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’<br><br>
        
        <b>Matthew 25:41-46 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>41</sup>  “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. <sup>42</sup> For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, <sup>43</sup> I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ <sup>44</sup> Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ <sup>45</sup> Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ <sup>46</sup> And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”</i><br><br>
        
        Describes this moment, where Jesus will separate the righteous from the unrighteous. Those who have trusted in Him and lived according to His commands will be placed at His right hand, while the unrepentant will be placed at His left.<br><br>
        
        In this moment, God’s people, having been redeemed and sanctified, will share in the judgment of the world. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Revelation 20:4 ESV</b><br>
        Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. </i><br><br>
        
        Revelation 20:4 speaks of those who will sit on thrones and judge alongside Christ. The accusers, who may have once mocked or condemned the righteous, will themselves face judgment. This echoes the imagery of the adulterous woman’s accusers, who, convicted by their own sin, could not stand in judgment over her.<br><br>
        
        The sinner, represented in Proverbs 5:14, will lament their choices, recognizing the gravity of ignoring God’s commands. They will see how their sin not only brought earthly ruin but also eternal separation from God. Yet, for those who repent and turn to Christ, there is hope. As the woman caught in adultery experienced, God’s grace is greater than any sin.<br><br>
        
        <b>Living in Obedience</b><br><br>
        
        The lesson of Proverbs 5:14 is a call to heed God’s wisdom and avoid the path of sin. It warns us of the consequences of ignoring discipline and embracing fleeting pleasures. Sin not only harms our relationship with God but also damages our standing within His community.<br><br>
        
        As believers, we are called to live lives of integrity, loving God with all our heart, soul, and mind. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 22:37 ESV</b><br>
        And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. </i><br><br>
        
        We are also reminded of our responsibility to extend grace to others, as Jesus did, while encouraging them to turn away from sin.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, this verse points us to the reality of Christ’s judgment. On that day, the righteous will stand with Him, vindicated before their accusers, while the unrepentant will face the consequences of their rebellion. Let us, therefore, strive to live in obedience, walking in the wisdom of God’s Word, and trusting in His grace to sustain us. For in Him, there is both justice and mercy, and through Him, we can stand blameless before the assembly of God’s people.
