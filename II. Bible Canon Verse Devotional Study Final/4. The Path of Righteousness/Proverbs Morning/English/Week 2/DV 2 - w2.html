        <h2>Proverbs 5:10</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NASB (New American Standard Bible)</p>
          

        <p><sup>10</sup> "And strangers will be filled with your strength, And your hard-earned possessions will go to the house of a foreigner"</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Consequences of Sinful Indulgence</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 5:10 warns, "And strangers will be filled with your strength, and your hard-earned possessions will go to the house of a foreigner." This verse vividly illustrates the consequences of giving in to sin—whether it is physical adultery or spiritual rebellion against God. Solomon emphasizes that succumbing to temptation drains one's resources, energy, and dignity, ultimately leaving a person impoverished and enslaved to those who do not care for their well-being. <br><br>

        In a culture that often glorifies the pursuit of personal desires, the mantra "If it feels good, do it" resonates deeply. However, this philosophy of moral relativism leads only to destruction. The promise of sin is sweet and enticing, but its end is bitterness and pain. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 5:3-4 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>3</sup> For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil, <sup>4</sup> but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.<br><br>
        
        <b>John 8:34 ESV</b><br>
        Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin. </i><br><br>
        
        Sin enslaves, robbing a person of their strength and resources. Jesus Himself taught that those who live for their own pleasures often find that what they sought for joy instead brings ruin.<br><br>
        
        The prodigal son in Luke 15 is a poignant example of this truth. He took his inheritance, left his father’s house, and squandered everything in reckless living. He believed that freedom meant pursuing his desires without constraint. However, he found himself destitute, working for a foreigner, and feeding pigs—a degrading task for a Jew. His wealth and strength had been consumed by strangers, leaving him with nothing but regret. Yet, the story of the prodigal son also reveals the hope of redemption. When he returned to his father, broken and repentant, he was welcomed with open arms and restored to his rightful place.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Luke 15:20-24 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>20</sup> And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. <sup>21</sup> And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ <sup>22</sup> But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. <sup>23</sup> And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. <sup>24</sup> For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate.</i><br><br>
        
        Solomon’s warning in Proverbs 5:10 urges us to guard against squandering our God-given strength and blessings. Instead of wasting our resources on fleeting pleasures, we are called to devote ourselves to God. Jesus identified the greatest commandment as loving God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Mark 12:30 NLT</b><br>
        And you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength.</i><br><br>
        
        This wholehearted devotion to God not only protects us from the pitfalls of sin but also leads to a life of purpose and fulfillment.<br><br>
        
        The verse also highlights the deceitfulness of sin. What appears to be a path to freedom and pleasure is, in reality, a path to slavery and loss. By indulging in sinful desires, we give control of our lives to forces that drain our vitality and joy. In contrast, living in obedience to God allows us to steward our resources and strength for His glory and for the good of others.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 5:10 serves as a sobering reminder that sin is costly. It robs us of our honor, possessions, and peace. Yet, the message of the gospel is that no matter how far we stray, God’s grace is sufficient to redeem and restore us. By turning away from sin and dedicating our lives to God, we can find true freedom and lasting joy in Him.
