        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Regret of Ignoring Wisdom
        </b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 5:13 expresses the anguished lament of one who failed to heed sound instruction: “I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me!” This verse captures a universal experience—regret over ignored warnings and missed opportunities to choose wisdom. It paints the picture of someone broken by the consequences of sin, realizing too late the value of guidance they had once dismissed. <br><br>

        God often places teachers, mentors, and wise counselors in our lives to guide us toward righteousness. These individuals are instruments of His grace, providing insight and warnings to steer us away from destructive choices. However, the responsibility to listen and obey lies with the one receiving the instruction. This verse reminds us that it is not the fault of the teacher when the student rejects wisdom—it is the fault of the one who fails to listen. <br><br>
        
        This pattern of ignoring godly instruction is seen throughout Scripture. Even Jesus, the greatest teacher of all, was rejected by many who heard Him. Despite His authoritative and life-giving words, the religious leaders and crowds often refused to accept His teachings. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 5:39-40 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>39</sup> “You search the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. But the Scriptures point to me! <sup>40</sup> Yet you refuse to come to me to receive this life.</i><br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 6:66 NLT</b><br>
        At this point many of his disciples turned away and deserted him. </i><br><br>
        
        Many of His followers turned away because His message challenged their comfort and expectations.<br><br>
        
        Jesus Himself likened the reception of God’s Word to seed scattered on various types of soil. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 13:18-23 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>18</sup> “Hear then the parable of the sower: <sup>19</sup> When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. <sup>20</sup> As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, <sup>21</sup> yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. <sup>22</sup> As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. <sup>23</sup> As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.” </i><br><br>
        
        While some seed falls on fertile ground and produces fruit, other seed falls on rocky or thorny ground, where it cannot thrive. This parable illustrates that the heart’s condition determines whether instruction will be accepted or ignored.<br><br>
        
        The consequences of rejecting wisdom are not limited to one’s spiritual life—they often extend to broken relationships, missed blessings, and personal suffering. The Apostle Paul warned Timothy of a time when people would reject sound teaching, seeking instead to satisfy their own desires with teachers who tell them what they want to hear. <br><br> 
        
        <i><b>2 Timothy 4:3 ESV</b><br>
        For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, </i><br><br>
        
        This rejection of truth inevitably leads to pain and regret, as those who ignore wisdom face the natural consequences of their choices.<br><br>
        
        Proverbs 5:13 challenges us to humble ourselves and receive instruction with open hearts. Wisdom is a gift, but it requires discipline and a willingness to listen. We are called to reflect on our own attitudes toward godly counsel. Are we receptive to correction, or do we resist it out of pride or stubbornness?<br><br>
        
        The regret expressed in this verse serves as a sobering reminder to prioritize wisdom and godly instruction while we have the chance. As the following verse warns:<br><br>

        <i><b>Hebrews 3:15 NLT</b><br>
        Remember what it says: “Today when you hear his voice, don’t harden your hearts as Israel did when they rebelled.”</i><br><br>

        By inclining our ears to the voices of those who teach truth and by obeying God’s Word, we can avoid the sorrow of looking back with regret on the path we chose to ignore. Let us embrace the guidance of our teachers, knowing that their instruction leads us to life, not ruin.
