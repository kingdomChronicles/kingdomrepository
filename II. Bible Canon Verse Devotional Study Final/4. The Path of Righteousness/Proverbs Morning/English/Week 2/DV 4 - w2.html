        <h2>Proverbs 5:12</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p><sup>12</sup> "You will say, 'How I hated discipline! If only I had not ignored all the warnings!"</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The High Cost of Ignoring Wisdom
        </b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 5:12 vividly captures the sorrow of a person who failed to heed godly counsel: “You will say, ‘How I hated discipline! If only I had not ignored all the warnings!’” This lament embodies the regret of someone who has chosen sin over wisdom, only to suffer its painful consequences. <br><br>

        The allure of sin often lies in its promise of immediate gratification. Discipline, on the other hand, requires self-control and foresight—qualities that, while not always "fun," safeguard us from future regret. The momentary pleasure of yielding to temptation blinds individuals to the inevitable pain it brings: guilt and physical consequences.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 5:11 NLT</b><br>
        In the end you will groan in anguish when disease consumes your body.</i><br><br>
        
        This verse also serves as a broader warning against disregarding God’s wisdom. Sin, in any form, thrives when we reject discipline and ignore the warnings of Scripture, mentors, and the Spirit. Those who despise correction often find themselves lamenting their choices too late. Guilt over past actions can be unbearable, especially when those actions bring irreversible consequences.<br><br>
        
        The story of Judas Iscariot illustrates this principle with chilling clarity. Judas ignored Jesus’ teachings and warnings, choosing instead to betray Him for thirty pieces of silver. His betrayal filled him with deep regret when he realized the gravity of his actions. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 27:3-4 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>3</sup> Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, <sup>4</sup> saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” They said, “What is that to us? See to it yourself.” <br><br>
        
        Tragically, Judas allowed his remorse to lead to despair rather than to repentance. Instead of turning to God for forgiveness, he succumbed to hopelessness, ending his life in despair.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 27:5 ESV</b><br>
        And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. </i><br><br>
        
        This contrasts sharply with the example of Peter, who also sinned grievously by denying Jesus three times. Unlike Judas, Peter’s sorrow led him to godly repentance. He sought restoration and became a pillar of the early church. <br><br>

        <i><b>Luke 22:61-62 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>61</sup> And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.” <sup>62</sup> And he went out and wept bitterly.</i><br><br>
        
        <i><b>Acts 2:14-20 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>14</sup> But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them: “Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. <sup>15</sup> For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. <sup>16</sup> But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel: <sup>17</sup>  “‘And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams; <sup>18</sup> even on my male servants and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. <sup>19</sup> And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke; <sup>20</sup>  the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day.<br><br>
        
        <b>Acts 2:21-28 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>21</sup> And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.’ <sup>22</sup> “Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know— <sup>23</sup> this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. <sup>24</sup> God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. <sup>25</sup> For David says concerning him, “‘I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken; <sup>26</sup> therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope. <sup>27</sup> For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One see corruption. <sup>28</sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’<br><br>
        
        <b>Acts 2:29-36 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>29</sup> “Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. <sup>30</sup> Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, <sup>31</sup> he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. <sup>32</sup> This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. <sup>33</sup> Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. <sup>34</sup> For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, “‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, <sup>35</sup> until I make your enemies your footstool.”’ <sup>36</sup> Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”<br><br>
        
        Acts 2:37-41 ESV
        <sup>37</sup> Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” <sup>38</sup> And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup>39</sup> For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.” <sup>40</sup> And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation.” <sup>41</sup> So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls. </i><br><br>
        
        This difference highlights the importance of responding to regret with humility and a willingness to return to God, rather than succumbing to hopelessness.<br><br>
        
        Proverbs 5:12 urges us to embrace discipline and heed warnings while there is still time. It reminds us that wisdom often requires choosing what is right over what is easy. As followers of Christ, we are called to submit to God’s guidance and resist the temptations that promise fleeting pleasure but bring lasting pain.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, this verse challenges us to value discipline as a gift from God. It is through correction and instruction that we grow in wisdom and avoid the sorrow of regret. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Hebrews 12:11 ESV</b><br>
        For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.</i><br><br>
        
        By trusting in God’s wisdom and submitting to His discipline, we can walk the path of life and avoid the lamentation of those who reject it.
