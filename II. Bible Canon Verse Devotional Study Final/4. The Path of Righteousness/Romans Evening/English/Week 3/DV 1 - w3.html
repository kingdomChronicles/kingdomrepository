        <h2>Romans 1:16</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
          

        <p>
          <sup>16</sup> For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>A Message for All Repentant Israelite Remnants Scattered Across the World and for All Gentiles Alike</b></p>

        <p> Romans 1:16 declares Paul’s unshakable confidence in the Gospel, stating, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile." This verse not only encapsulates the essence of Paul’s mission but also reflects God’s eternal plan to bring salvation to all humanity—first to His chosen people, Israel, and then to the rest of the world. <br><br>

        During Paul’s time, the Good News of salvation was proclaimed first to the Israelite remnants. As God’s covenant people, the Israelites were given the Law, the prophets, and the promises of the Messiah. Jesus Himself, born into the nation of Israel, began His ministry among the Israelite remnants. This prioritization was part of God’s divine plan, as salvation is, as Jesus stated, “from the Israelites”. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 4:22 NKJV</b><br>
        You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. </i><br><br>
        
        However, this message of hope and redemption was never meant to be exclusive to one nation. It was always intended to reach the Gentiles—non-Israelite nations—thus fulfilling God’s promise to bless all the families of the earth through Abraham’s descendants.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Genesis 12:3 NKJV</b><br>
        I will bless those who bless you, And I will curse him who curses you; And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”</i><br><br>
        
        Paul, an Israelite man called to be an apostle to the Gentiles, understood this plan deeply. In every city he visited, Paul began his ministry by preaching in the synagogues of the Israelite remnants, giving his fellow Israelites the first opportunity to hear the Good News. When they rejected the message, as often happened, he turned to the Gentiles, proclaiming the Gospel to all who would listen. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Acts 13:46 NLT</b><br>
        Then Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and declared, “It was necessary that we first preach the word of God to you Jews. But since you have rejected it and judged yourselves unworthy of eternal life, we will offer it to the Gentiles. </i><br><br>
        
        This pattern reflected God’s overarching design: the message of salvation began with the Israelite remnants but was always meant to encompass all people, breaking down barriers of ethnicity, culture, and social status.<br><br>
        
        In the last days, as we live in today, this divine calling remains. God is gathering His scattered people, the Israelite remnants who have been dispersed among all nations, and extending His grace to the Gentiles who believe in the Gospel of the Kingdom. This universal invitation underscores the inclusivity of God’s salvation plan. It is not bound by geography, lineage, or tradition but is offered to anyone who believes in the power of the Gospel.<br><br>
        
        Paul’s boldness in proclaiming the Gospel serves as a reminder for believers today. Like Paul, we must not be ashamed of the Good News, regardless of the opposition or ridicule we may face. The Gospel is the power of God for salvation, a transformative message that changes lives and reconciles humanity to God. It is not our role to convince or force others to believe; rather, we are called to share the message faithfully and allow the Holy Spirit to work in the hearts of those who hear it.<br><br>
        
        Moreover, Paul’s compassion for both the Israelite remnants and the Gentiles challenges us to view all people as recipients of God’s grace. The Gospel is not limited to those who look like us, speak our language, or share our culture. It is for everyone, everywhere. This truth should inspire us to step beyond our comfort zones, reaching out to both the familiar and the unfamiliar with the message of salvation.<br><br>
        
        In conclusion, Romans 1:16 reminds us of the universal scope of God’s salvation. The Good News was first proclaimed to the Israelite remnants, but it extends to all nations, offering hope to anyone who believes. In these last days, God is calling both His scattered people and the Gentiles to Himself. As believers, we are tasked with sharing this message with compassion and urgency, trusting the Holy Spirit to convict and transform lives. Let us embrace this mission with confidence, knowing that the Gospel we proclaim is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.
