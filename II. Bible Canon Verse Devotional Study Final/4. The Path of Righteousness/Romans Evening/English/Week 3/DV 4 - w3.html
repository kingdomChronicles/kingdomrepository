        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Sins of Humanity Series - Series 1 / Part 2/8</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>God’s Revelation to Humanity</b></p>

        <p> Romans 1:19 declares, “For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.” This verse is a profound reminder that God’s existence, power, and divine nature are clearly revealed to all humanity. It underscores that the evidence of God is not hidden but displayed openly through His creation, leaving no room for excuses. This passage serves as both an assurance for believers and a warning for those who choose to reject Him. <br><br>

        The verse follows a striking statement in Romans 1:18, where Paul describes the wrath of God revealed against human sinfulness. God’s anger is not arbitrary but a response to humanity's ungodliness and unrighteousness. Many people suppress the truth about God, refusing to acknowledge Him despite the overwhelming evidence of His existence. They do not lack knowledge; rather, they willfully reject it. This suppression of truth is rooted in rebellion, not ignorance.<br><br>
        
        Paul emphasizes that God has made Himself “plain” to everyone. The natural world itself testifies to God’s reality. From the vastness of the universe to the intricate design of life on Earth, creation proclaims the existence of an intelligent, all-powerful Creator. This is a universal revelation that transcends time, culture, and geography. God has shown Himself not only in the beauty of nature but also in the moral law written in the hearts of all people.<br><br>
        
        What makes this passage sobering is that humanity’s disobedience is not due to a lack of evidence but a refusal to accept the truth. Many suppress what they know about God to pursue their own desires and avoid accountability. This rebellion leads to spiritual blindness and separation from God. It is a reminder that ignoring God’s revelation has dire consequences, both in this life and in eternity.<br><br>
        
        For believers, Romans 1:19 serves as an affirmation of God’s fairness and justice. No one can claim ignorance of His existence because He has made it clear through creation. This truth also challenges Christians to respond with gratitude and worship, acknowledging God’s majesty in the world around them. Furthermore, it reminds believers of their responsibility to share the gospel, pointing others to the Creator who has revealed Himself so clearly.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Romans 1:19 calls humanity to humility and accountability. God has made Himself known, leaving no excuse for rebellion. The evidence of His existence is all around us, urging us to seek Him and live according to His truth. For those who embrace this revelation, it leads to life and peace. For those who suppress it, the consequences are eternal. Let us, then, respond to God’s self-revelation with faith, obedience, and awe, acknowledging His power and divine nature in all that He has made.
