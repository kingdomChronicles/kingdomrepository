        <h2>Romans 1:17</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p>
          <sup>17</sup> This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, 'It is through faith that a righteous person has life.

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Good News: Righteousness Through Faith</b></p>

        <p> Romans 1:17 states, "This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, 'It is through faith that a righteous person has life.'” Together with the previous verse, this passage is often seen as the central theme of the book of Romans. Paul boldly declares that he is unashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes. <br><br>

        <i><b>Romans 1:16 NLT</b><br>
        For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes—the Jew first and also the Gentile. </i><br><br>
        
        Here, Paul explains what the gospel accomplishes: it reveals how God makes humanity righteous in His sight.<br><br>
        
        The righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel as something that is granted to human beings—not earned—through their faith in Christ. This righteousness, which is necessary for salvation, is not achieved by obeying the law or performing good works. Instead, it is a gift, freely given by God to those who place their trust in Christ. The phrase "from faith to faith" underscores that this righteousness is entirely rooted in faith from beginning to end.<br><br>
        
        Paul makes it clear that human beings cannot be justified or declared righteous by following the law. The law exposes sin and shows humanity's inability to meet God's perfect standards. No amount of good works or ritual obedience can reconcile us to God. Without righteousness, humanity stands condemned and separated from God because of sin.<br><br>
        
        However, the gospel offers hope. Through the death and resurrection of Christ, God has provided a way for sinful humanity to be reconciled to Him. Jesus bore the penalty of death and separation from God on the cross for our sins. When we trust in Christ, God sees us through Him and declares us "righteous" or "justified." This declaration is not based on anything we do but solely on our faith in Christ's completed work. Paul reiterates this idea in Philippians: <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Philippians 3:8-9 NKJV</b><br>
        <sup>8</sup> Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ <sup>9</sup> and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith; </i><br><br>
        
        "That I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith." This righteousness is a divine gift, a cornerstone of the "good news" that brings salvation to all who believe.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Habakkuk 2:4 NKJV</b><br>
        Behold the proud, His soul is not upright in him; But the just shall live by his faith. </i><br><br>
        
        Paul's quotation of Habakkuk, "The righteous shall live by his faith," highlights that this principle of faith is not new. Even in the Old Testament, God revealed that righteousness and life come through faith. This consistent truth bridges the old and new covenants, showing that faith has always been the key to a right relationship with God.<br><br>
        
        For believers today, Romans 1:17 serves as a reminder of the transformative power of the gospel. It emphasizes that salvation and righteousness are not earned through human effort but received through faith. This truth frees us from the burden of trying to earn God's favor and calls us to a life of trust in His promises. It also challenges us to share this Good News with others, so they too may experience the life and righteousness that come through faith in Christ.<br><br>
        
        In conclusion, the gospel reveals God's plan to make humanity righteous through faith, a plan that begins and ends with trusting Him. Romans 1:17 calls us to embrace this truth wholeheartedly, knowing that it is by faith that we live and are made right with God. Let us hold fast to this message and boldly share it with the world, confident in the life-transforming power of the Good News.
