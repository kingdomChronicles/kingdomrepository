Amen.</i>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Sins of Humanity Series - Series 1 / Part 3/8</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>God's Revelation Through His Creation</b></p>

        <p> The passage in Romans 1:20 is a clear declaration of the power and divinity of the Lord, revealed through His creation. It states, "For His invisible attributes, namely, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse." In this verse, Paul emphasizes that God has provided sufficient evidence of His presence and power so that every person may come to know Him. <br><br>

        <b>God's Revelation in Nature</b><br><br>
        
        According to the preceding verses, Paul states that those who are unrighteous reject the knowledge of God. They deliberately suppress the truth to avoid acknowledging the Lord's presence. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 1:18-19 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>18</sup> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. <sup>19</sup> For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. </i><br><br>
        
        However, God has clearly revealed Himself to all people. How has this been done? Through His creation. Nature and the entire universe serve as witnesses to the power and divinity of the Lord.<br><br>
        
        Paul explains that even those who have not heard the Gospel can have a basic understanding of God by observing nature. The beauty of the world, the vastness of the universe, and the intricacy of every creature reveal His eternal power. As David said:<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalm 19:1-6 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>1</sup> The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork. <sup>2</sup> Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge. <sup>3</sup> There is no speech, nor are there words, whose voice is not heard. <sup>4</sup>  Their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun, <sup>5</sup>  which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy. <sup>6</sup> Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them, and there is nothing hidden from its heat.</i><br><br>
        
        <b>Evidence of God in All Creation</b><br><br>
        
        The things we see around us—mountains, seas, clouds, and stars—are clear evidence of a powerful Creator. What kind of power would it take to create all of this? Surely, it would require eternal power. Such creation is not the work of humans but of a divine being. The logical conclusion from observing nature is that there is a God we must recognize and serve.<br><br>
        
        <b>Humanity’s Rejection of Truth</b><br><br>
        
        Despite the clear evidence, many people choose to reject God. Some believe in theories of creation that deny God as the Creator. However, according to Romans 1:20, God does not accept such arguments. He declares that the knowledge evident in nature is sufficient for people to seek Him. Anyone who genuinely seeks God will find Him. As Jesus said:<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 7:7-8 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>7</sup> “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. <sup>8</sup> For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. </i><br><br>
        
        <b>Without Excuse</b><br><br>
        
        Ultimately, the verse states that those who do not acknowledge God are "without excuse." Failure to recognize God is not due to a lack of evidence but to a deliberate disregard for the truth. God has issued a clear invitation to all through His creation. We are called to submit to Him and acknowledge Him as our Creator.<br><br>
        
        In summary, Romans 1:20 reminds us that God constantly reveals Himself. Nature serves as a testimony to His power and divinity. The only question is whether we are willing to respond to His invitation or continue to deny the truth. The choice is ours—will we seek God or reject His clear revelation?
