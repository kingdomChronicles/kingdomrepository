        <p>
          <sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,
          <sup>2</sup> which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Paul’s Identity and Mission Series (1/4)</b></p>

        <p> The opening verses of Romans are a masterful introduction to Paul’s life, calling, and the essence of the gospel message. In Romans 1:1-3, Paul reveals not only who he is but also the divine purpose that defines his existence. His words provide a glimpse into his unwavering commitment to Christ and his role in proclaiming salvation to the world. <br><br>

        <b>Paul’s Identity: Servant and Apostle</b><br><br>
        
        Paul introduces himself as a “servant of Christ Jesus.” The term “servant” (Greek: doulos) implies total surrender and devotion. Unlike a hired worker, a bondservant is bound to their master for life, serving not out of compulsion but with loyalty and dedication. By identifying as a servant, Paul emphasizes that his life is no longer his own; it belongs entirely to Christ. This serves as a powerful reminder to all believers that discipleship means submitting to Christ’s lordship in every aspect of life.<br><br>
        
        In addition to being a servant, Paul identifies himself as an apostle, someone set apart and sent out by Christ. His apostleship was not self-appointed but divinely ordained, confirmed during his encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Acts of the Apostles 9:15 NLT</b><br>
        But the Lord said, “Go, for Saul is my chosen instrument to take my message to the Gentiles and to kings, as well as to the people of Israel. <br><br>
        
        <b>Galatians 2:7-9 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>7</sup> Instead, they saw that God had given me the responsibility of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as he had given Peter the responsibility of preaching to the Jews. <sup>8</sup> For the same God who worked through Peter as the apostle to the Jews also worked through me as the apostle to the Gentiles. <sup>9</sup> In fact, James, Peter, and John, who were known as pillars of the church, recognized the gift God had given me, and they accepted Barnabas and me as their co-workers. They encouraged us to keep preaching to the Gentiles, while they continued their work with the Jews. </i><br><br>
        
        This calling marked Paul as a chosen instrument to carry the message of salvation to the Gentiles. His dual identity—humble servant and authoritative messenger—demonstrates the balance between submission to God and the responsibility to fulfill His mission.<br><br>
        
        <b>Set Apart for the Gospel</b><br><br>
        
        Paul’s mission was clear: he was “set apart for the gospel of God.” The idea of being set apart speaks to a life of singular purpose, consecrated for a holy task. Paul understood that his life was dedicated to spreading the good news of Jesus Christ. The gospel, as Paul notes, was not a new concept but one rooted in God’s promises through the prophets in the Scriptures. This continuity underscores the faithfulness of God’s plan, culminating in the arrival of His Son, Jesus Christ.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Gospel Centered on Christ</b><br><br>
        
        At the heart of Paul’s message is Jesus Christ, “descended from David according to the flesh.” This statement affirms Jesus’ humanity and His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies as the Messiah. By highlighting Jesus’ lineage, Paul connects the gospel to God’s covenant with Israel while also emphasizing its universal scope. The good news is not limited to one nation or people but is the fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan for all humanity.<br><br>
        
        <b>A Model for Believers</b><br><br>
        
        Paul’s identity and mission challenge believers to examine their own lives. Like Paul, we are called to live as servants of Christ, fully surrendered to His will. We are also set apart, entrusted with the task of sharing the gospel in our own contexts. Paul’s example inspires us to embrace both humility and boldness as we fulfill our God-given purpose.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>
        
        Romans 1:1-3 introduces profound truths about Paul’s identity, calling, and the gospel’s foundation. His dual role as a servant and apostle underscores the balance of humility and responsibility in serving Christ. Rooted in the promises of Scripture, Paul’s mission serves as a powerful reminder of God’s faithfulness and the centrality of Christ in the message of salvation. Through Paul’s example, we are encouraged to live lives wholly dedicated to the gospel, bringing glory to God and hope to the world.<br><br>
