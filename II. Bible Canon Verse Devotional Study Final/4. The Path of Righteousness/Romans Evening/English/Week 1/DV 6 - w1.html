        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Grace and Apostleship</b></p>

        <p> In Romans 1:5, Paul weaves together the essence of his calling, the power of grace, and the scope of the gospel’s mission. This verse reveals not only Paul’s role as an apostle but also the grand purpose of Christ's work: to bring people from all nations into the obedience of faith for the glory of His name. <br><br>

        <b>Grace: The Foundation of Paul’s Calling</b><br><br>
        
        Paul begins by acknowledging that it is through Jesus Christ that he has received grace. Grace, in this context, refers to the unmerited favor of God, freely given through Christ’s sacrifice.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Acts of the Apostles 9:1-5 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>1</sup> Meanwhile, Saul was uttering threats with every breath and was eager to kill the Lord’s followers. So he went to the high priest. <sup>2</sup> He requested letters addressed to the synagogues in Damascus, asking for their cooperation in the arrest of any followers of the Way he found there. He wanted to bring them—both men and women—back to Jerusalem in chains. <sup>3</sup> As he was approaching Damascus on this mission, a light from heaven suddenly shone down around him. <sup>4</sup> He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me?” <sup>5</sup> “Who are you, lord?” Saul asked. And the voice replied, “I am Jesus, the one you are persecuting! </i><br><br>
        
        Paul, once a fierce persecutor of Christians, was transformed by this grace into a fervent apostle of Christ. His life exemplifies the truth that God’s grace is not earned but gifted, empowering believers to fulfill their divine calling.<br><br>
        
        For Paul, this grace was not just about personal salvation. It was the foundation of his apostleship—his role as one sent by Christ to proclaim the gospel. This same grace enables all believers to serve God in their unique capacities, reminding us that every good work begins and is sustained by God’s unearned favor.<br><br>
        
        <b>Apostleship: The Authority to Speak for Christ</b><br><br>
        
        <i><b>Acts of the Apostles 9:15 NLT</b><br>
        But the Lord said, “Go, for Saul is my chosen instrument to take my message to the Gentiles and to kings, as well as to the people of Israel. </i><br><br>
        
        Paul’s apostleship was not self-assumed or granted by human authority. It was a direct commission from Jesus, where Christ declared Paul a chosen instrument to carry His name to the Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel. This divine authority allowed Paul to speak and act on behalf of Christ, delivering the gospel message with confidence and clarity.<br><br>
        
        The apostleship also came with a responsibility: to bring about the "obedience of faith." This phrase highlights the connection between belief and action. Faith in Christ is not a passive acknowledgment but an active trust that results in obedience to God’s will. True faith manifests in a life transformed by the gospel, marked by submission to Christ as Lord.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Obedience of Faith</b><br><br>
        
        The "obedience of faith" is a central theme in Paul’s writings. Here, Paul emphasizes that obedience begins with faith in Christ. To believe in Jesus is to obey His call to salvation. Refusing to believe is, in itself, disobedience.<br><br>
        
        This obedience extends beyond initial faith to encompass a life of walking with Christ. Faith produces fruit—actions and attitudes that align with God’s commands. Paul’s mission was to call people from all nations to this kind of obedience, demonstrating that salvation is not just about individual transformation but also about <i><b>living in a way that honors Christ’s name</b></i>.<br><br>
        
        <b>For the Glory of Christ’s Name</b><br><br>
        
        Paul makes it clear that his mission is "for the sake of His name." The ultimate purpose of bringing people to faith and obedience is not merely their salvation but the glory and honor of Jesus Christ. This echoes the central purpose of all creation: to glorify God. When people from every nation come to faith and live in obedience to Christ, His name is exalted, fulfilling God’s eternal plan.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Global Mission of the Gospel</b><br><br>
        
        Paul’s unique calling was to carry the gospel to the Gentiles, breaking down barriers between Jews and non-Jews. This verse underscores the universal scope of the gospel. Salvation is not limited to a specific ethnicity or culture but is available to all nations. Paul’s apostleship was a fulfillment of Jesus’ command to make disciples of all nations.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 28:19-20 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>19</sup> Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, <sup>20</sup> teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”</i><br><br>
        
        This global mission continues today. Believers are called to share the gospel, demonstrating <i><b>through their lives</b></i> the transformative power of faith in Christ. The obedience of faith is not confined to the early church but is an ongoing call for all who follow Jesus.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        Romans 1:5 captures the essence of Paul’s ministry and the heart of the gospel message. Through the grace of Christ, Paul was called to apostleship, tasked with bringing people from all nations into the obedience of faith. This obedience, rooted in belief in Jesus, glorifies His name and fulfills God’s redemptive plan for humanity.<br><br>
        
        For modern believers, this verse serves as both a reminder and a challenge. We, too, are recipients of grace and called to live in obedience to faith, reflecting Christ’s glory in all we do. And just as Paul was sent to proclaim the gospel to all nations, we are called to carry this message of hope and transformation to the world, ensuring that Jesus' name is honored among all people throughout the world.
