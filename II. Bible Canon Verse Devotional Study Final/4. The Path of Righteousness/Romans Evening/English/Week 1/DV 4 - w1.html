        <h2>Romans 1:1-3</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p>
          <sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,
          <sup>2</sup> which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,
          <sup>3</sup> concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Paul’s Identity and Mission Series (4/4)</b></p>

        <p> Romans 1:1-3 opens with a powerful declaration of Paul’s identity, calling, and purpose, setting the stage for the rich theological insights in the rest of the letter. These verses not only provide insight into Paul’s role as a servant and apostle but also emphasize the gospel of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of God’s promises. Through these words, Paul reveals his unwavering commitment to the message of salvation and the centrality of Christ in God’s redemptive plan. <br><br>

        <b>Paul’s Identity and Calling</b><br><br>
        
        Paul introduces himself as a servant of Christ Jesus, highlighting his complete devotion and submission to his Lord. The term "servant" (doulos in Greek) signifies a bondservant who willingly surrenders their life to serve their master. This identity reflects Paul’s humility and his recognition that his life belongs entirely to Christ.<br><br>
        
        In addition to being a servant, Paul identifies himself as an apostle, one called and sent out by God to proclaim the gospel. His apostleship was not self-appointed but divinely ordained, rooted in his encounter with Christ on the road to Damascus. <br><br>

        <i><b>Acts 9:3-6 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>3</sup> Now as he went on his way, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him. <sup>4</sup> And falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” <sup>5</sup> And he said, “Who are you, Lord?” And he said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. <sup>6</sup> But rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.” </i><br><br>

        <i><b>Acts 9:7-9 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>7</sup> The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. <sup>8</sup> Saul rose from the ground, and although his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. <sup>9</sup> And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</i><br><br>

        <i><b>Acts 9:10-14 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>10</sup> Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias.” And he said, “Here I am, Lord.” <sup>11</sup> And the Lord said to him, “Rise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying, <sup>12</sup> and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.” <sup>13</sup> But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup> And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.” </i><br><br>

        <i><b>Acts 9:15-16 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>15</sup> But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel. <sup>16</sup> For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.” </i><br><br>
        
        This dual identity—servant and apostle—demonstrates the balance of humility and authority required to fulfill God’s purposes.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Gospel: Promised and Fulfilled</b><br><br>
        
        Paul declares that he was set apart for the gospel of God, a message rooted in God’s promises and revealed through the prophets in the Scriptures. The gospel is not a new concept but the fulfillment of a divine plan that spans the entirety of Scripture. From the covenant with Abraham to the promises of the prophets, the Old Testament pointed to the coming of the Messiah.<br><br>
        
        Central to this gospel is Jesus Christ, who Paul describes as “descended from David according to the flesh.” This reference affirms Jesus’ Messianic lineage and His fulfillment of the covenant made with David.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Samuel 7:12-16 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>12</sup> When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. <sup>13</sup> He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. <sup>14</sup> I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, <sup>15</sup> but my steadfast love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you. <sup>16</sup> And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.’” </i><br><br>
        
        By highlighting Jesus’ humanity and lineage, Paul ties the gospel to God’s faithfulness and His plan to bring salvation to the world.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Relevance for Believers</b><br><br>
        
        Paul’s introduction in Romans 1:1-3 carries profound relevance for believers today.<br><br>
        
        <b>First</b>, it reminds us of our identity in Christ. Like Paul, we are called to be servants of Christ, wholly devoted to His will. This means surrendering our personal ambitions and desires to align our lives with God’s purposes.<br><br>
        
        <b>Second</b>, it emphasizes the importance of Scripture. The gospel is deeply rooted in God’s promises, revealed through the Bible. As followers of Christ, we are called to study and understand the Scriptures, recognizing how they testify to the saving work of Jesus and provide guidance for our lives.<br><br>
        
        <b>Finally</b>, Paul’s declaration underscores the centrality of Jesus in our faith. The gospel is not about rules, rituals, or traditions—it is about a relationship with the living Christ, who fulfills God’s promises and offers salvation to all who believe. In Jesus, we find the ultimate fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan and the hope of eternal life.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        Romans 1:1-3 introduces us to Paul’s profound understanding of his identity, calling, and the gospel. As a servant and apostle, Paul was set apart to proclaim the good news promised in the Scriptures and fulfilled in Jesus Christ. This passage serves as a timeless reminder of God’s faithfulness and the transformative power of the gospel.<br><br>
        
        It challenges us to embrace our identity as servants of Christ, to anchor our faith in the Scriptures, and to center our lives on the gospel. Just as Paul lived to proclaim the good news, we too are called to share the message of salvation, which remains the power of God for everyone who believes. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 1:16 NLT</b><br>
        For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes—the Jew first and also the Gentile. </i><br><br>
        
        Through this calling, we participate in God’s eternal plan, living lives that glorify Him and reflect His love to the world.
