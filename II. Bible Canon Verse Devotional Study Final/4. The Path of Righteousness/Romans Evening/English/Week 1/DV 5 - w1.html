        <h2>Romans 1:4</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
          

        <p>
          <sup>4</sup> "and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord."

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Declaration of Jesus Christ as Lord</b></p>

        <p> Romans 1:4 presents a profound declaration about the identity of Jesus Christ. Through the Spirit of holiness, Jesus was declared the Son of God in power by His resurrection from the dead. This verse is a cornerstone of Christian theology, encapsulating the truth of Jesus' divinity, the significance of His resurrection, and His rightful place as Lord over all. <br><br>

        <b>The Spirit of Holiness: Proclaiming Jesus as the Son of God</b><br><br>
        
        Paul begins by pointing to the role of the "Spirit of holiness," a term referring to the Holy Spirit, in affirming Jesus’ identity. The resurrection of Christ was not merely an extraordinary event but a divine declaration. Through the power of the Spirit, Jesus was revealed as the Son of God. This proclamation was not a new status for Jesus but a confirmation of what had always been true.<br><br>
        
        Jesus' resurrection is central to the gospel message. It was the ultimate demonstration of divine power and holiness, affirming that Jesus is not just a man but the eternal Son of God. His victory over death proved His authority over sin, the grave, and all creation. No human effort or natural phenomenon could achieve such an act; only the Spirit of God could raise Jesus from the dead, validating His divine nature.<br><br>
        
        <b>Fully Human and Fully Divine</b><br><br>
        
        In the preceding verse, Paul emphasizes Jesus’ humanity, describing Him as a descendant of King David. This lineage fulfilled Old Testament prophecies, establishing Jesus’ rightful claim as the Messiah. However, Romans 1:4 shifts the focus to Jesus' divinity, underscoring the profound truth that He is both fully human and fully God.<br><br>
        
        This dual nature of Christ is essential to the Christian faith. As a man, Jesus lived a sinless life, experienced human suffering, and died a sacrificial death for humanity's sins. As God, His resurrection was a demonstration of His power and authority, offering eternal life to all who believe. This perfect union of humanity and divinity makes Jesus uniquely qualified to be the Savior of the world.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Significance of the Resurrection</b><br><br>
        
        The resurrection is the defining moment in the gospel narrative. It is not only a historical event but also a theological cornerstone. Paul highlights that the resurrection "appointed" or "declared" Jesus as the Son of God in power. This does not imply that Jesus became the Son of God at His resurrection; rather, it publicly affirmed His identity and mission.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 28:6 NLT</b><br>
        He isn’t here! He is risen from the dead, just as he said would happen. Come, see where his body was lying. </i><br><br>
        
        The resurrection fulfilled Jesus' own predictions where He declared that He would rise on the third day. It also confirmed His authority to forgive sins.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Mark 2:10 ESV</b><br>
        But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralytic— </i><br><br>
        
        Without the resurrection, Jesus' claims about Himself would have been unsubstantiated, and the gospel would lose its power. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 Corinthians 15:17 NLT</b><br>
        And if Christ has not been raised, then your faith is useless and you are still guilty of your sins. </i><br><br>
        
        The empty tomb, however, stands as a testament to His victory and the hope of eternal life for all who trust in Him.<br><br>
        
        <b>Jesus Christ Our Lord</b><br><br>
        
        Paul concludes the verse by affirming the rightful response to Jesus’ resurrection and identity: acknowledgment of His lordship. Jesus is not just a Savior but also "our Lord." This title signifies His authority over all creation and His rule in the lives of believers. It calls for submission, worship, and obedience.<br><br>
        
        Recognizing Jesus as Lord means more than acknowledging His divinity. It requires a personal commitment to follow Him, to live according to His teachings, and to surrender to His will. Paul’s greeting in Romans reminds us that the gospel is not merely good news to be heard but a truth that demands a response—a life transformed by the power of Christ’s resurrection.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        Romans 1:4 encapsulates the majesty and mystery of Jesus Christ. Through the Spirit of holiness, His resurrection declared Him to be the Son of God in power. This declaration confirms His divine identity, His victory over death, and His rightful place as Lord. For believers, this verse is a call to worship, to bow before Jesus as Lord, and to live in the hope and power of His resurrection. It is a reminder that the gospel is not just about what Jesus has done but about who He is—the <i><b>eternal Son of God, fully human, fully God</b></i>, and the <i><b>reigning King of all</b></i>.
