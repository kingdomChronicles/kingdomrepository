          <sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Paul’s Identity and Mission Series (3/4)</b></p>

        <p> The opening verses of Paul’s letter to the Romans lay a foundational framework for understanding his life, calling, and message. Romans 1:1-3 introduces Paul as a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, and set apart for the gospel of God. These verses emphasize the gospel's central figure—Jesus Christ—and its fulfillment of God’s promises, establishing the tone for the theological richness of the letter. <br><br>

        <b>Jesus: The Center of the Gospel</b><br><br>
        
        Paul immediately centers the gospel on Jesus Christ, declaring Him as the fulfillment of God’s promises and the cornerstone of salvation. By referring to Jesus as a descendant of David "according to the flesh," Paul affirms the fulfillment of the Old Testament covenant that a ruler from David’s line would reign forever. This connection ties the gospel to the broader narrative of Scripture, revealing God’s faithfulness to His promises.<br><br>
        
        The genealogies in Matthew and Luke further confirm Jesus’ Messianic lineage, establishing His rightful claim as the promised King. However, Paul does not stop at Jesus’ human ancestry. He presents a more profound truth: Jesus is both fully human and fully divine. This dual nature is essential to the gospel, as it demonstrates that Jesus, though born into the line of David, transcends mere humanity.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Purpose of Christ’s Humanity</b><br><br>
        
        The incarnation of Jesus—God taking on human flesh—is central to Paul’s message. As fully human, Jesus experienced life’s struggles and temptations, yet He lived without sin. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Hebrews 4:15 ESV</b><br>
        For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. </i><br><br>
        
        This perfection qualified Him as the spotless Lamb of God, capable of bearing the sins of humanity on the cross. By taking on flesh, Jesus bridged the gap between God and humanity, becoming the mediator through whom reconciliation is possible.<br><br>
        
        Yet Jesus’ humanity is only part of the story. His divinity, which Paul elaborates on later in Romans, demonstrates His authority over sin and death. It is through His resurrection that Jesus is declared the Son of God in power. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 1:4 ESV</b><br>
        and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, </i><br><br>
        
        Thus, the gospel is a proclamation of Jesus’ complete work: His incarnation, death, and resurrection, all of which secured salvation for those who believe.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Fulfillment of Prophecy</b><br><br>
        
        Paul reminds his readers that the gospel is not a new concept but one deeply rooted in the promises made by God through the prophets. From Genesis to Malachi, the Scriptures point forward to a Redeemer who would reconcile humanity to God. Isaiah foretells a suffering servant who would bear the sins of many (Isaiah 53), while Jeremiah and Ezekiel speak of a new covenant established through the Messiah.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Jeremiah 31:31-34 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>31</sup> “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, <sup>32</sup> not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the Lord. <sup>33</sup> For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. <sup>34</sup> And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”</i><br><br>
        
        <i><b>Ezekiel 36:26-27 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>26</sup> And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. <sup>27</sup> And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules. </i><br><br>
        
        Paul's statement that the gospel was “promised long ago” highlights the sovereignty and faithfulness of God. The coming of Christ was neither sudden nor unexpected but the fulfillment of God's long-standing plan for the salvation of humanity. By anchoring the gospel in Scripture, Paul assures his readers that the message of salvation through Christ is trustworthy and consistent with God’s eternal plan.<br><br>
        
        <b>Paul’s Role in the Gospel Mission</b><br><br>
        
        Paul’s introduction also sheds light on his role in God’s redemptive work. As a “servant of Christ Jesus,” Paul exemplifies humility and total devotion to his Lord. His apostleship, however, reflects the authority and responsibility given to him by God to proclaim the gospel, especially to the Gentiles. Paul’s life, as seen in his letters and ministry, demonstrates the depth of his commitment to the gospel and his willingness to endure hardship for its sake.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Corinthians 11:23-28 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>23</sup> Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one—I am talking like a madman—with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death. <sup>24</sup> Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. <sup>25</sup> Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea; <sup>26</sup> on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers; <sup>27</sup> in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. <sup>28</sup> And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches. </i><br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        Romans 1:1-3 reveals the core of Paul's identity and mission: the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. At the heart of this message is Jesus, who came from the lineage of David according to the flesh and fulfilled the promises of God. Through His incarnation, death, and resurrection, Jesus accomplished humanity's salvation and established the bridge between God and man. Paul's words remind believers of the faithfulness of God's plan and the central role of Christ in the message of salvation. Like Paul, we are called to focus our lives on the gospel, embracing our responsibility to share the good news with all people until it reaches the entire world.
