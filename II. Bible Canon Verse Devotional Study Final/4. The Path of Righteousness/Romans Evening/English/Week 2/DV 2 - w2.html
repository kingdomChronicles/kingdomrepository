        <h2>Romans 1:7</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p>
          <sup>7</sup> "I am writing to all of you in Rome who are loved by God and are called to be his own holy people. May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace."

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>A Call to Holiness In these last days
        </b></p>

        <p> In Romans 1:7, Paul addresses the believers in Rome, reminding them of two profound truths: they are loved by God and called to be His holy people. Though Paul wrote this letter to the Christians of his time, its message resonates deeply with all believers, especially those called by God in these last days. It serves as both an affirmation of our identity in Christ and a reminder of our divine purpose. <br><br>

        <b>Loved by God</b><br><br>
        
        Paul begins by declaring that the recipients of his letter are loved by God. This truth is foundational to the Christian faith and echoes throughout Scripture. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 3:16 NKJV</b><br>
        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. </i><br><br>
        
        We are reminded that God's love extends to the entire world, a love so profound that He sent His only Son to save us. For believers, this love is not only universal but also deeply personal. It is a love that calls us out of darkness and into a relationship with Him.<br><br>
        
        In these last days, as the world grows increasingly chaotic and uncertain, this truth remains an anchor for all believers. To know we are loved by God is to find strength and comfort amid trials. It assures us that we are never alone, for the One who holds the universe in His hands also holds us close to His heart.<br><br>
        
        <b>Called to Be His Holy People</b><br><br>
        
        Paul goes further to describe the believers as "called to be His own holy people." This calling is not merely an invitation but a divine commissioning. To be "holy" means to be set apart for God's purposes, to live in a way that reflects His character and brings glory to His name.<br><br>
        
        In the New Testament, the term "saint" is applied to all believers. It is not a title reserved for a select few but a designation for everyone who is in Christ. Holiness is not about human perfection; it is about being covered by Christ's righteousness and walking in obedience to Him.<br><br>
        
        For believers in these last days, this calling takes on a renewed urgency. The world needs a witness of God's holiness, and we are that witness. We are called to stand out, not by conforming to the patterns of this age but by being transformed by the renewing of our minds. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 12:2 NKJV</b><br>
        And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. </i><br><br>
        
        Our lives should reflect the light of Christ, offering hope and direction to those lost in spiritual darkness.<br><br>
        
        <b>Grace and Peace</b><br><br>
        
        Paul concludes his greeting with a blessing of grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. These words are more than a standard salutation; they carry deep theological significance.<br><br>
        
        Grace is the unmerited favor of God, the foundation of our salvation and the source of our strength for daily living. Peace is the result of that graceâ€”a deep and abiding sense of well-being that comes from being reconciled to God.<br><br>
        
        In these last days, grace and peace are gifts we must treasure and extend to others. Grace empowers us to fulfill our calling, while peace sustains us in the face of adversity. Together, they enable us to live as holy people in a world desperate for the hope we carry.<br><br>
        
        <b>A Message to All God's Elect, Chosen and True Believers</b><br><br>
        
        Paul's words to the Romans are not confined to a specific time or place. They are a timeless message for all who are loved by God and called to be His holy people. This includes every believer today, regardless of nationality, language, or background.<br><br>
        
        In these last days, the call to holiness and the assurance of God's love are more relevant than ever. As we face challenges that test our faith, we must remember who we are in Christ. We are loved by God, set apart for His purposes, and equipped with His grace and peace.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        Romans 1:7 is a powerful reminder of our identity and purpose as believers. We are loved by God, called to be His holy people, and blessed with His grace and peace. These truths are not only comforting but also empowering, especially in these last days when the world desperately needs the light of Christ.<br><br>
        
        As we live out this calling, may we reflect God's holiness in our actions, extend His grace to those around us, and walk in His peace, confident in the knowledge that we are His beloved. In doing so, we fulfill our purpose and bring glory to His name, standing firm as His chosen people in these final days before His return.
