        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Paul’s Identity and Mission Series (2/4)</b></p>

        <p> The opening verses of Romans provide a powerful glimpse into Paul’s understanding of his calling and the gospel’s significance. Romans 1:1-3 introduces Paul as a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, and set apart for the gospel. These verses reflect Paul’s profound sense of identity and purpose and lay the foundation for the rich theological insights that follow in the letter. <br><br>

        <b>The Gospel: Promised and Fulfilled</b><br><br>
        
        Paul defines his mission as proclaiming the gospel of God, a message rooted in the promises made in the Old Testament. He emphasizes that the gospel is not a new revelation but the fulfillment of prophecies spoken through the prophets in the Scriptures. This continuity highlights God’s unchanging nature and His redemptive plan, which spans history and culminates in Jesus Christ.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Genesis 12:3 NKJV</b><br>
        I will bless those who bless you, And I will curse him who curses you; And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”</i><br><br>
        
        The Old Testament is filled with glimpses of the gospel. God’s covenant with Abraham established that all nations would be blessed through his lineage, and the Psalms and prophets repeatedly spoke of a coming Messiah. Isaiah, for example, foretold the suffering servant who would bear the sins of many. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Isaiah 53:1-6 NKJV</b><br>
        <sup>1</sup> Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? <sup>2</sup> For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant, And as a root out of dry ground. He has no form or comeliness; And when we see Him, There is no beauty that we should desire Him. <sup>3</sup> He is despised and rejected by men, A Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him; He was despised, and we did not esteem Him. <sup>4</sup> Surely He has borne our griefs And carried our sorrows; Yet we esteemed Him stricken, Smitten by God, and afflicted. <sup>5</sup> But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed. <sup>6</sup> All we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one, to his own way; And the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.<br><br>
        
        <b>Isaiah 53:7-12 NKJV</b><br>
        <sup>7</sup> He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He opened not His mouth; He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, And as a sheep before its shearers is silent, So He opened not His mouth. <sup>8</sup> He was taken from prison and from judgment, And who will declare His generation? For He was cut off from the land of the living; For the transgressions of My people He was stricken. <sup>9</sup> And they made His grave with the wicked— But with the rich at His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was any deceit in His mouth. <sup>10</sup> Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief. When You make His soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand. <sup>11</sup> He shall see the labor of His soul, and be satisfied. By His knowledge My righteous Servant shall justify many, For He shall bear their iniquities. <sup>12</sup> Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the great, And He shall divide the spoil with the strong, Because He poured out His soul unto death, And He was numbered with the transgressors, And He bore the sin of many, And made intercession for the transgressors.</i><br><br>
        
        Paul draws on these prophecies to show that Jesus is the long-awaited fulfillment of God’s promise, bridging the Old and New Testaments into one cohesive narrative of redemption.<br><br>
        
        <b>Paul’s Identity: Servant and Apostle</b><br><br>
        
        Paul describes himself first as a “servant of Christ Jesus.” The term doulos (servant) conveys the idea of complete devotion, submission, and loyalty. Paul’s servanthood reflects his recognition that his life is no longer his own but belongs entirely to Christ. This humility underscores the believer’s relationship with Christ—a relationship marked by willing surrender and obedience.<br><br>
        
        In addition to being a servant, Paul identifies himself as an apostle, one called and sent out to proclaim the gospel with authority. His apostleship was not self-appointed; it was divinely ordained, beginning with his dramatic encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Acts 9:15-16 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>15</sup> But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel. <sup>16</sup> For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.” </i><br><br>
        
        Paul’s role as an apostle carried the responsibility to teach, lead, and shepherd God’s people, further emphasizing the seriousness of his calling.<br><br>
        
        <b>Jesus: The Heart of the Gospel</b><br><br>
        
        At the center of Paul’s message is Jesus Christ, the fulfillment of God’s promises. Paul highlights Jesus’ humanity by stating that He was “descended from David according to the flesh.” This reference affirms Christ’s lineage as the promised King, fulfilling the covenant made with David that his throne would be established forever. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Samuel 7:12-16 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>12</sup> When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. <sup>13</sup> He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. <sup>14</sup> I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, <sup>15</sup> but my steadfast love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you. <sup>16</sup> And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.’” </i><br><br>
        
        Jesus’ descent from David also connects Him to the broader narrative of Israel’s history, grounding the gospel in God’s faithfulness to His people.<br><br>
        
        Yet, Paul’s description extends beyond genealogy. The gospel is not merely about Jesus’ earthly descent but also about His divine mission. As both fully human and fully divine, Jesus bridges the gap between humanity and God, offering salvation through His life, death, and resurrection.<br><br>
        
        <b>Application for Believers</b><br><br>
        
        Paul’s introduction challenges believers to reflect on their own identity and mission. Just as Paul saw himself as a servant and messenger, every follower of Christ is called to live a life devoted to God’s purposes. The gospel’s fulfillment in Christ reminds us of God’s unchanging faithfulness and invites us to participate in His redemptive work.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        Romans 1:1-3 encapsulates the essence of Paul’s identity and mission while grounding the gospel in God’s eternal plan. Paul’s dual identity as a servant and apostle reflects the humility and authority required to carry out God’s work. The gospel he proclaims is not an isolated event but the culmination of centuries of divine promises fulfilled in Jesus Christ. As believers, we are reminded of our own call to live as servants of Christ, sharing the good news with the same conviction and commitment Paul exemplified.
