        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Sharing the Good News with Compassion and Urgency</b></p>

        <p> In Romans 1:13–15, Paul expresses his deep desire to bring God’s message to all people, saying, "I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you…in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles." These verses reflect Paul's unwavering commitment to preaching the Gospel and his strategic vision to reach the diverse population of Rome. His message to the Romans carries a timeless reminder for us: to share the Good News with compassion and urgency, trusting the Spirit of God to convict hearts and lead people into His Kingdom. <br><br>

        Paul's longing to visit Rome stems from his desire to "reap a harvest," a metaphor for leading people to faith in Christ. He understood the magnitude of his mission: to bring salvation to Jews and Gentiles alike. Paul’s life was driven by the call to share the message of salvation, and he saw himself as obligated to everyone—Greeks and barbarians, the wise and the foolish. This universal approach reflects the inclusiveness of the Gospel, which is intended for all people, regardless of their culture, intellect, or background.<br><br>
        
        For believers today, Paul’s example serves as a call to action. We are reminded to share the message of Christ with everyone, leaving the work of conviction to the Holy Spirit. Our role is not to force anyone to believe but to faithfully proclaim the Gospel, trusting that God will work in their hearts. As we plant the seeds of truth, God is the one who brings the growth, ensuring that those who respond in faith will be included in His Kingdom.<br><br>
        
        Sharing the Gospel also requires compassion. Paul’s eagerness to preach stemmed from his love for people and his desire to see them experience the salvation promised by God. This compassion should inspire us to look beyond our own comfort zones and reach out to those who have not yet heard the Good News. Whether it is through face-to-face interactions or leveraging modern technology, such as social media and online platforms, the message of salvation must reach as many as possible.<br><br>
        
        Additionally, Paul’s strategic vision in targeting Rome as a hub for evangelism is noteworthy. He recognized that the city’s diversity and influence could amplify the spread of the Gospel to many nations and cultures. Similarly, we are called to think intentionally about where and how we share God’s message, whether by engaging in local outreach by sharing the Word of God to your surroundings, supporting missions through the Kingdom of God Programs, or using technology to connect with a global audience.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Paul's mission reminds us of the urgency of sharing the Gospel. The promise of salvation is available now, and we are God’s instruments in delivering this message to the world. The time to act is not tomorrow but today, for we do not know when Christ will return.<br><br>
        
        In conclusion, Romans 1:13–15 calls believers to embrace the responsibility of proclaiming the Good News to everyone. We are to act with compassion, urgency, and trust in the Spirit of God to convict hearts. As we follow Paul’s example, let us carry the message of salvation boldly, ensuring that as many as possible hear of God’s love and the promise of eternal life. May we share the Gospel with the hope that others, too, will be welcomed into God’s Kingdom and receive the salvation He offers.
