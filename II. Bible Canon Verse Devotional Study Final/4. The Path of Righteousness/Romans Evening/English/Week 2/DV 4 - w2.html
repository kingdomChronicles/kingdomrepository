        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Timeless Impartation of Spiritual Gifts</b></p>

        <p> In Romans 1:11, Paul writes, "I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong." This verse not only highlights Paul's deep desire to minister to the believers in Rome but also reveals a profound truth: spiritual matters, including the impartation of spiritual gifts, are not bound by time. Through the written Word of God, Paul's longing to strengthen the Roman believers transcends the centuries, offering spiritual blessings to us in these last days. <br><br>

        Paul’s eagerness to visit the Roman believers was driven by his sincere desire to see them grow stronger in their faith. He wanted to use the spiritual gifts given to him by God—particularly his gifts of teaching and evangelism—to build them up in Christ. This demonstrates that spiritual gifts are not for personal gain but for the edification and encouragement of others. The same principle applies to believers today. The spiritual gifts bestowed upon us are meant to strengthen the body of Christ, transcending time and geography through the Spirit's work in every generation.<br><br>
        
        It is significant that Paul's intent was to impart something "to make you strong." His focus was not on temporary or material concerns but on the eternal. The strength he sought for the Roman believers was spiritual—a deeper faith, greater understanding of the Gospel, and a closer relationship with Christ. This reminds us that true strength comes from God and is cultivated through His Word, prayer, and the fellowship of believers. Even though Paul could not visit Rome at the time, the letter he wrote continues to impart spiritual strength to countless generations.<br><br>
        
        Paul's ministry also teaches us about the importance of mutual encouragement in the faith. In the following verse, he acknowledges that while he intends to strengthen the Roman believers, he also expects to be encouraged by their faith.<br><br> 
        
        <i><b>Romans 1:12 NLT</b><br>
        When we get together, I want to encourage you in your faith, but I also want to be encouraged by yours.</i><br><br>
        
        This mutual exchange is a timeless principle. As we exercise our spiritual gifts and share the Word of God, we not only build others up but are also strengthened in return. This dynamic underscores the beauty of Christian fellowship, where the Spirit works through each member of the body to bless and encourage one another.<br><br>
        
        In these last days, Paul's words remind us of the timelessness of spiritual truths. The same gifts and blessings he desired to impart to the Roman believers are available to us today through the Word of God. The Scriptures are a living testimony of God's will and a means by which spiritual gifts are imparted to strengthen believers across generations.<br><br>
        
        Romans 1:11 reveals the eternal significance of sharing the spiritual gifts we have received from God. Paul’s desire to share a spiritual gift with the believers in Rome was fulfilled not only during their time but also extends to us today. Through the written Word of God, we continue to receive strength, inspiration, and blessings that transcend time and place. Everyone who has received Christ and entered His kingdom has already been given a gift from God. We only need to allow ourselves to be used as instruments of the Lord. The positive effect of this is that we discover the gift God has given us, and as we continue to be used by Him, our gifts grow stronger and more abundant. May we also use these gifts to strengthen others, so that the body of Christ remains steadfast and ready for the Lord's return.
