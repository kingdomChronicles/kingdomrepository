        <h2>Romans 1:6</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NKJV (New King James Version)</p>
          

        <p>
          <sup>6</sup> "among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;"
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Call to Obedience</b></p>

        <p> In Romans 1:6, Paul addresses the believers in Rome, reminding them that they are “the called of Jesus Christ.” Though this letter was penned to a specific audience in a specific time, the message resounds across the centuries and speaks directly to the called of Christ in these last days. Paul's mission, as outlined in the previous verses, was to proclaim the gospel to all nations and bring them into the obedience of faith. This call is not just for first-century Rome but for every believer across the globe today. <br><br>

        <b>The Call of Jesus Christ</b><br><br>
        
        Paul’s words emphasize that believers are not merely individuals who have stumbled upon faith; they are called by Jesus Christ Himself. This calling is both personal and purposeful. It is personal because each believer is chosen by God to enter into a relationship with Him. It is purposeful because this calling is meant to lead to the obedience of faith—a life lived in surrender to Christ and in alignment with His will.<br><br>
        
        In these last days, this calling takes on an even greater urgency. The world faces challenges that test the faith of believers, from moral decay to widespread unbelief. Yet, just as Paul reminded the Roman Christians of their identity in Christ, so too must believers today remember that they are called by Jesus, not to conform to the world, but to be His witnesses.<br><br>
        
        <b>A Global Mission</b><br><br>
        
        Paul’s mission was to proclaim the gospel to all nations, bringing them into the obedience of faith. This mission remains unchanged. Believers today are part of a global body of Christ, united in the calling to share the good news. The scope of this mission reflects the heart of God, who desires that none should perish but that all should come to repentance.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Peter 3:9 NLT</b><br>
        The Lord isn’t really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent. </i><br><br>
        
        These last days, the urgency of this mission is heightened. As the signs of Christ’s return become more evident, the call to proclaim the gospel to all nations grows louder. Believers are called not only to live out their faith but also to actively participate in advancing God’s kingdom. This echoes the Great Commission, where Jesus instructed His followers to make disciples of all nations.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 28:19 NLT</b><br>
        Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. </i><br><br>
        
        <b>The Obedience of Faith</b><br><br>
        
        Paul’s message in Romans is centered on the obedience of faith—a concept that remains vital for believers today. Faith is not merely intellectual assent; it is a wholehearted trust in Christ that leads to action. Obedience flows naturally from genuine faith, as believers align their lives with God’s will.<br><br>
        
        In these last days, the obedience of faith is a testimony to a watching world. When believers live out their calling, they demonstrate the transformative power of the gospel. This obedience is not about legalism or earning salvation; it is a response to God’s grace and a reflection of His work in our lives.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Called in the Last Days</b><br><br>
        
        Just as Paul wrote to the Christians in Rome, believers today are called by Jesus Christ. This calling is both a privilege and a responsibility. It is a privilege because it means being part of Christ, chosen by Him to belong to His family and His Kingdom. It is also a responsibility because it includes the command to live obediently to His will, share the gospel with all people, care for the needs of His Kingdom, and expand His Kingdom here on earth.<br><br>
        
        In these last days, this calling requires steadfastness. The challenges facing believers—persecution, temptation, and spiritual apathy—are real. Yet, the call of Christ empowers believers to rise above these challenges and fulfill their purpose. They are called to be light in the darkness, to stand firm in the truth, and to proclaim the hope of salvation.<br><br>
        
        <b>A Lasting Theology</b><br><br>
        
        Paul’s letter to the Romans presents the most comprehensive picture of Christian theology in the New Testament. It lays out the foundation of salvation, grace, faith, and obedience. This theology is not confined to first-century Rome; it is timeless and universal. In these last days, it serves as a guide for believers navigating the complexities of a world in spiritual turmoil.<br><br>
        
        The call to belong to Christ is a call to be part of His mission. It is a call to embrace the gospel, live it out, and share it with others. It is a call to stand firm in faith, even as the world grows increasingly hostile to the message of Christ.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        Romans 1:6 reminds believers of their identity as the “called of Jesus Christ.” This calling is a constant across time, uniting the early Christians in Rome with believers in the last days. Paul’s mission to proclaim the gospel and bring about the obedience of faith is echoed in the global mission of the Church and His Kingdom today.<br><br>
        
        As we approach the fulfillment of God’s plan in these last days, the calling of Christ takes on a renewed significance. Believers are called to live in obedience, proclaim the gospel, and reflect the glory of Christ in their lives. This is not just a message for Rome; it is a message for the world, for every believer who hears the call of Christ and responds in faith.
