        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Sins of Humanity Series - Series 2 / Part 3/7</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Consequences of Rejecting God</b></p>

        <p> Romans 1:28 states, "And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done." This verse serves as a sobering warning about the consequences of turning away from God. It reveals a divine principle: when people persistently reject the knowledge of God, He allows them to experience the full effects of their sinful choices. This is not an arbitrary punishment but rather the natural consequence of a life lived apart from God’s truth. <br><br>

        <b>The Root of the Problem: Willful Rejection of God</b><br><br>
        
        The preceding verses of Romans 1 explain that humanity has been given enough evidence of God's existence and nature. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 1:18-20 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>18</sup> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. <sup>19</sup> For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. <sup>20</sup> For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. </i><br><br>
        
        Through creation and conscience, people can recognize His power and divine nature. However, instead of honoring Him, many choose to suppress the truth and follow their own wisdom, which ultimately leads to foolishness. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 1:21-23 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>21</sup> For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. <sup>22</sup> Claiming to be wise, they became fools, <sup>23</sup> and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.</i><br><br>
        
        This rejection is not a result of ignorance but a deliberate choice. When people refuse to acknowledge God, they inevitably replace Him with false beliefs, leading them down a path of moral and spiritual corruption.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Wrath of God: Allowing Sin to Run Its Course</b><br><br>
        
        God’s wrath in this passage is not shown through immediate destruction or judgment but through the withdrawal of His restraining grace. Instead of forcing people to obey Him, He allows them to indulge in their sinful desires, leading to a debased mind—a way of thinking that is morally corrupt and incapable of discerning what is good. This is a form of divine judgment where people reap the consequences of their own rebellion.<br><br>
        
        Previously, Paul highlighted the perversion of human sexuality as one of the manifestations of this corruption. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 1:24-27 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>24</sup> Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, <sup>25</sup> because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. <sup>26</sup> For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; <sup>27</sup> and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.</i><br><br>
        
        However, Romans 1:28 expands this idea, showing that the rejection of God results in all kinds of moral decay. Without God's guidance, human nature descends into chaos, leading to actions that bring harm to both individuals and society.<br><br>
        
        <b>Cause and Effect: The Painful Consequences of Sin</b><br><br>
        
        This passage illustrates an undeniable truth: sin carries inherent consequences. When people disregard God's moral standards, they do not find freedom or fulfillment but instead suffer the effects of their choices. Broken relationships, addiction, violence, and deep dissatisfaction are some of the many results of a life detached from God's wisdom. What God prohibits is not meant to oppress humanity but to protect it from self-destruction. The moral boundaries He sets are designed for our good, and when we cross them, we experience harm.<br><br>
        
        <b>A Call to Acknowledge God</b><br><br>
        
        Romans 1:28 should serve as a warning and a call to repentance. It reminds us that rejecting God leads to destruction, not because He actively seeks to punish, but because life without Him naturally results in ruin. The only way to escape this downward spiral is to turn back to God, acknowledge Him, and submit to His rule. True wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (Proverbs 9:10), and only in Him can we find the clarity, peace, and righteousness that our souls truly long for.<br><br>
        
        This passage ultimately points us to the necessity of Christ. The gospel is the only power that can transform a debased mind into a renewed one. Through faith in Jesus, we receive a new heart and a new spirit, enabling us to live according to God’s will. In contrast to those who reject God, believers are called to live lives that reflect His holiness, showing the world that acknowledging God leads not to destruction, but to life in its fullest.
