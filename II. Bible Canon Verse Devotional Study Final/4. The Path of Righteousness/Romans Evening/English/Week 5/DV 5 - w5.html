        <h2>Romans 1:26-32</h2>

        <p>
        <i><sup>26</sup> For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; <sup>27</sup> and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. <sup>28</sup> And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. <sup>29</sup> They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness.  They are gossips,<sup>30</sup> slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, <sup>31</sup> foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. </i><b><sup>32</sup> Though they know God’s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.</b>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Sins of Humanity Series - Series 2 / Part 7/7</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Tragic Cycle of Sin and Humanities Approval</b></p>

        <p> Romans 1:32 serves as a sobering conclusion to Paul's indictment of humanity's sinful nature. It reveals not only the depth of human rebellion against God but also the tragic reality that people do not merely engage in sin—they endorse it, encouraging others to do the same. Paul highlights that mankind is not sinning out of total ignorance; rather, people are fully aware of God's righteous decree that those who commit such sins deserve death, yet they persist in their wrongdoing. Worse still, they take pleasure in the moral corruption of others, reinforcing a cycle of disobedience and decay. <br><br>

        Paul's argument in Romans 1 builds upon the idea that when people reject God's truth, He allows them to follow their desires. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 1:18-28 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>18</sup> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. <sup>19</sup> For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. <sup>20</sup> For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. <sup>21</sup> For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. <sup>22</sup> Claiming to be wise, they became fools, <sup>23</sup> and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things. <sup>24</sup> Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, <sup>25</sup> because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. <sup>26</sup> For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; <sup>27</sup> and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. <sup>28</sup> And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. </i><br><br>
        
        This leads to all forms of wickedness, ranging from idolatry to envy, deceit, and malice.<br><br> 
        
        <i><b>Romans 1:29-31 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>29</sup> They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, <sup>30</sup> slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, <sup>31</sup> foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. </i><br><br>
        
        However, Romans 1:32 makes a crucial point—sin is not just an individual problem; it is a collective one. When a society normalizes and celebrates sin, it accelerates its own destruction. Paul is not merely condemning those who commit these sins but also those who encourage them, making themselves complicit in rebellion against God.<br><br>
        
        Yet, this passage is not only about "other people." It is easy to read Romans 1 and assume Paul is referring solely to unbelievers, but in the next chapter (Romans 2:1), he turns the focus inward, showing that all humanity is guilty before God. Even those who claim to live under the law of Moses or any moral standard still fall short. Sin is not just about external actions; it is rooted in the very nature of humanity. Whether through open defiance or silent approval, every person shares in this guilt.<br><br>
        
        This reality leads us to a humbling conclusion: apart from God's grace, we are all trapped in sin. Paul’s message is not simply to expose sin but to highlight our need for redemption. Romans 1:32 should not only make us recognize the depth of human depravity but also point us toward the only hope we have—Jesus Christ. The condemnation of sin is real, but so is the invitation to salvation. Through Christ, we can break free from both the practice and approval of sin, turning instead to a life that honors God and His righteousness.
