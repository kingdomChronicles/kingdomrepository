        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Sins of Humanity Series - Series 2 / Part 5/7</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Humanity’s Descent into Unrighteousness: The Consequence of Rejecting God</b></p>

        <p> Paul’s indictment of humanity in Romans paints a grim picture of what happens when people turn away from God. He lays out a devastating list of sins, showing how the refusal to acknowledge God inevitably leads to moral decay, suffering, and destruction. This is not merely a list of divine punishments; rather, it is the natural consequence of a world that insists on rejecting its Creator. When humanity chooses to ignore God, He steps aside and allows us to experience the full weight of our choices. What follows is the unraveling of morality, relationships, and society itself. <br><br>

        <i><b>Romans 3:23 ESV</b><br>
        for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, </i><br><br>
        
        Romans 3:23 states that all have sinned and fall short of God's glory. This means that sin is not an isolated problem for a select few; it is the universal condition of humanity. Paul describes people as slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, and disobedient to parents. These are not just extreme acts of rebellion but also everyday attitudes that reveal the depth of human corruption. What is striking about Paul’s list is that it includes what many might consider "minor" sins alongside "major" ones. From arrogance to outright hatred of God, from boasting to inventing evil, all of these stem from the same root—the rejection of God’s authority.<br><br>
        
        The world often views certain sins as trivial or excusable. Many believe that pride, disobedience, and slander are simply part of human nature and not as severe as more obvious evils like murder or idolatry. However, Paul challenges this way of thinking. In God's eyes, all sin—no matter how society classifies it—is a symptom of a heart that has turned away from Him. This rebellion, whether subtle or blatant, separates people from God and leads to suffering. Humanity’s desire to live independently from Him has only resulted in the very pain and chaos that God warned about.<br><br>
        
        Perhaps the most sobering reality in Paul's message is that God's judgment often takes the form of letting us have what we think we want. He does not always send immediate destruction or visible punishment. Instead, He withdraws His guiding hand, allowing people to experience the full consequences of living apart from Him. This is both a warning and a reality check: the more we push God away, the deeper we sink into destruction, and the more we become enslaved to our own sinful desires.<br><br>
        
        Yet, Paul’s message does not end in despair. After exposing the depths of human sinfulness, he moves to the most important question: Is there a way out? If all have sinned and fall short, is there hope for restoration? The answer, as Paul will reveal, is found in Jesus Christ. While sin leads to death, the gift of God is eternal life through faith in Christ. The only way back from unrighteousness is not through human effort or moral improvement, but through the grace of God, who offers salvation to all who repent and believe.<br><br>
        
        Paul’s warning is clear: ignoring God leads to destruction, but acknowledging Him opens the door to redemption. The choice remains—will humanity continue down the path of sin, or will it turn back to the only One who can restore what has been lost?<br><br>

        This is why we need the Reign of God. It begins with His reign in our personal lives, then extends to our families, then to our nation, until ultimately, His rule is fully established over the entire world. Only through His sovereignty can true peace, righteousness, and divine order prevail.<br><br>

        <i><b>Thy Kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</b></i>
