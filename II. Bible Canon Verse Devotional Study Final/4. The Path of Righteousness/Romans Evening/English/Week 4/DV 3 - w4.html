        <p>
          <i><sup>18</sup> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. <sup>19</sup> For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.  <sup>20</sup> For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.<sup>21</sup> For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. <sup>22</sup> Claiming to be wise, they became fools, <sup>23</sup> and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things. </i><b><sup>24</sup> Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,</b> <i> <sup>25</sup> because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.</i>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Sins of Humanity Series - Series 1 / Part 7/8</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Consequences of Rejecting God</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 1:24 reflects the consequences of humanity's rejection of God and His truth. Paul elaborates on this in Romans 1:18-25, describing how turning away from God leads to a downward spiral of moral corruption. Despite God revealing His existence and divine qualities through creation, humanity willfully chooses to deny Him. This refusal to acknowledge God as Creator, Provider, and Lord results in spiritual blindness and futile thinking. <br><br>

        When people reject God's truth, they lose the ability to make right judgments about life and morality. Instead of worshiping the Creator, they worship created things—images resembling humans, animals, and other objects of their own making. In their pride, they claim to be wise but become foolish, exchanging the glory of God for idols. This idolatry is a profound insult to God, as it replaces His rightful place in our hearts with things that cannot truly satisfy.<br><br>
        
        In response to this rebellion, God "gives them up" to the consequences of their choices. This is not merely an act of abandonment but a form of divine judgment. God allows humanity to pursue the desires of their hearts, even when those desires lead to impurity and dishonor. By stepping aside, God permits people to experience the full impact of living apart from His design, particularly in their relationships and sexual behavior.<br><br>
        
        One example of this is the misuse of God's gift of sex. From the beginning, God intended sex to be a beautiful and sacred bond between a man and woman and not man on man or woman on woman. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Genesis 2:23-25 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>23</sup> Then the man said, “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.” <sup>24</sup>  Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. <sup>25</sup> And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.</i><br><br>
        
        However, when humanity rejects God, this gift becomes distorted and corrupted. Instead of bringing joy and intimacy, it leads to pain, exploitation, and brokenness. The indulgence in immoral desires results in emotional and physical suffering, fractured relationships, and a society that drifts further from God's design.<br><br>
        
        At first glance, allowing humanity to follow its own sinful desires may not seem like punishment. However, the suffering and misery that arise from unchecked passions reveal the gravity of this judgment. When God steps aside, humanity faces the natural consequences of living in rebellion against Him—brokenness, dissatisfaction, and despair.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, this passage serves as a sobering reminder of the dangers of turning away from God. It highlights the importance of acknowledging Him as Creator and Lord, living according to His design, and seeking His wisdom in all aspects of life. Only by honoring and worshiping God can humanity find true purpose, joy, and fulfillment.<br><br>
        
        In conclusion, Proverbs 1:24 warns us of the cost of rejecting God's truth. It challenges us to reflect on our lives and turn to Him in repentance and faith. May we choose to honor Him, live in obedience to His Word, and experience the blessings of a life aligned with His perfect will.
