They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, <sup>30</sup> slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, <sup>31</sup> foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. <sup>32</sup> Though they know God’s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.</i>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Sins of Humanity Series - Series 2 / Part 1/7</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>God's Judgment and Human Rebellion</b></p>

        <p> Romans 1:26 states, "For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature." This verse captures a profound truth about the consequences of humanity’s rejection of God. The Apostle Paul paints a vivid picture of how God, in response to human ungodliness and rebellion, allows people to pursue the depths of their sinful desires. This passage is both a warning and a call to reflect on the holiness of God and the devastating effects of turning away from Him. <br><br>

        Paul begins by explaining that God’s wrath is revealed against humanity’s suppression of His truth. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 1:18-20 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>18</sup> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. <sup>19</sup> For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.  <sup>20</sup> For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. </i><br><br>
        
        Humanity, despite clear evidence of God’s existence and divine power, chose to reject Him as Creator and instead worshipped creation. This idolatry, the elevation of created things above the Creator, is the root cause of humanity’s moral decay. In response, God "gave them up"—a phrase Paul uses multiple times in this chapter—to the consequences of their rebellion. This abandonment is not a passive act but an active judgment, allowing humanity to experience the destructive nature of their sin.<br><br>
        
        In verse 26, Paul specifically addresses the corruption of God’s design for human relationships and sexuality. Sexual desire, as created by God, is a beautiful gift meant to be enjoyed within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Genesis 2:23-25 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>23</sup> Then the man said, “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.” <sup>24</sup> Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. <sup>25</sup> And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.</i><br><br>
        
        It is a reflection of intimacy, love, and the unity of God’s creation. However, when humanity rejects God’s truth, even this gift is distorted. Paul describes how women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature, an expression of dishonorable passions. This distortion reflects humanity’s deeper spiritual rebellion, where God’s good design is rejected in favor of self-centered desires.<br><br>
        
        It is important to note that Paul’s condemnation is not of sexual desire itself. Scripture affirms that sexual expression, within God’s boundaries, is a good and holy gift. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 Timothy 4:4 ESV</b><br>
        For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,</i><br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 Corinthians 7:4-5 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>4</sup> The wife gives authority over her body to her husband, and the husband gives authority over his body to his wife. <sup>5</sup> Do not deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. Afterward, you should come together again so that Satan won’t be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</i><br><br>
        
        What Paul condemns is the misuse of this gift—the twisting of what God intended for good into something that dishonors Him and His creation. Female homosexuality, as mentioned here, and male homosexuality in the following verse, are presented as examples of this distortion.<br><br>
        
        Paul’s words also highlight the direct connection between humanity’s rejection of God and the unraveling of moral and relational order. By choosing to worship creation instead of the Creator, humanity becomes enslaved to their passions, losing sight of God’s perfect will. This is not only a judgment but a reflection of what happens when people exchange God’s truth for lies. The dishonor and brokenness that follow serve as a stark reminder of the consequences of living apart from God.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Romans 1:26 is a call to return to God’s truth. It reminds us that God’s design for humanity is good and that rejecting Him leads to chaos and destruction. Yet, even in the face of rebellion, God’s grace remains available. Through Christ, humanity can be restored, forgiven, and brought back into alignment with God’s will. This verse challenges believers to uphold God’s truth, seek His righteousness, and proclaim the hope of redemption found in Jesus. It is a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin but also a call to embrace the transformative power of God’s grace.
