 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">Journey of the Three Kings To Bethlehem</p>
                               

<p>
<sup>1</sup>Some days after their departure from home, I saw the caravan of Theokeno come up with those of Mensor and Seir at a ruined city. <br>
<sup>2</sup>Rows of tall pillars were still standing here and in many places large beautiful statues. <br>
<sup>3</sup>A band of wild robbers had taken up their quarters among the ruins. <br>
<sup>4</sup>They were clothed in the skins of beasts and armed with spears; they were of a brownish color, short and stout, but very agile. <br>
<sup>5</sup>The three caravans left this city together at daybreak and, after journeying half a day, rested in a very fertile district where there was a spring around which were many roomy sheds. <br>
<sup>6</sup>This was an ordinary halting place for caravans. <br>
<sup>7</sup>Each of the Kings had in his train, as companions, four nobles of his own race; but he himself was like a patriarch over all. <br>
<sup>8</sup>He took care of all, commanded all, dispensed to all. <br>
<sup>9</sup>In each caravan were to be found people of different color. <br>
<sup>10</sup>Mensor’s race was of a pleasing brownish color; Seir’s was brown; and Theokeno’s of a bright yellow. <br>
<sup>11</sup>I saw no shining black, saving the slaves, of whom each king possessed some.<br>
<sup>12</sup>The nobles holding staves in their hands, sat upon their dromedaries high among the piled-up packages, which were covered with hangings. <br>
<sup>13</sup>These were followed by other animals almost as large as horses, on which servants and slaves rode among the baggage. <br>
<sup>14</sup>On their arrival, they unloaded the animals and watered them at the spring. <br>
<sup>15</sup>This spring was surrounded by a little mound upon which was a wall with three open entrances. <br>
<sup>16</sup>In this enclosed space was a cistern, somewhat lower than the surrounding surface. <br>
<sup>17</sup>It had a pump with three pipes furnished with faucets. <br>
<sup>18</sup>Over the cistern was a cover usually kept locked. <br>
<sup>19</sup>But a man from the ruined city had accompanied the travelers, and he on payment of a tax, unlocked the reservoir. <br>
<sup>20</sup>The travelers had leathern vessels, which could be folded perfectly flat. <br>
<sup>21</sup>They were divided into four compartments, which when filled afforded drink to four of the camels at once. <br>
<sup>22</sup>These people were extremely careful of the water; not a drop was suffered to go to waste. <br>
<sup>23</sup>Then the beasts were put up in an enclosed, but uncovered space close to the spring, the stall of each animal being separated from its neighbor’s by a partition. <br>
<sup>24</sup>There were some troughs before them, into which was poured the feed which had been brought with them. <br>
<sup>25</sup>It consisted of corn, the grains of which were as large as acorns. <br>
<sup>26</sup>Among the baggage were bird baskets, high and narrow, which hung on the sides of the animals among the broad packages. <br>
<sup>27</sup>In the separate compartments of these baskets, either singly or in pairs, according to their different sizes, were birds like doves or hens. <br>
<sup>28</sup>They served for food on the way. <br>
<sup>29</sup>In leathern chests, they had loaves, all of the same size, like single plates, closely packed together. <br>
<sup>30</sup>Only as many as were needed were taken out at once. <br>
<sup>31</sup>They had with them very costly vessels of yellow metal set with precious stones. <br>
<sup>32</sup>They were almost exactly of the shape of our sacred vessels, some like chalices, some like little boats and dishes, out of which they drank and upon which they handed around the food. <br>
<sup>33</sup>The rims of most of these vessels were set with precious stones.<br>
<sup>34</sup>The three races were somewhat different in costume. <br>
<sup>35</sup>Theokeno and his followers, as well as Men-sor, wore high caps embroidered in colors, and white bands wound thickly around their heads. <br>
<sup>36</sup>Their short coats reached to the calf of the leg, and were very simple with only a few buttons and ornaments on the breast. <br>
<sup>37</sup>They were enveloped in light, wide, and very long mantles which trailed behind. <br>
<sup>38</sup>Seir and his followers wore caps with little white pads and round cowls embroidered in colors. <br>
<sup>39</sup>They had shorter mantles, which were, however, longer behind than in front. <br>
<sup>40</sup>Under their mantles were short tunics buttoning down to the knee and ornamented on the breast with laces, spangles, and innumerable glittering buttons, button on button. <br>
<sup>41</sup>On one side of the breast was a little sparkling shield like a star. <br>
<sup>42</sup>All had bare feet bound with laces to which soles were fastened. <br>
<sup>43</sup>The nobles wore short swords or large knives in their girdles, and they had many bags and boxes hanging about them. <br>
<sup>44</sup>Among the kings and their relatives were men about fifty, forty, thirty, and twenty years old. <br>
<sup>45</sup>Some wore their beard long, others short. <br>
<sup>46</sup>The servants and camel drivers were much more simply clothed; indeed, some had only a strip of stuff or an old garment around them.<br>
<sup>47</sup>When the beasts had been fed, watered, and stalled, and the attendants themselves had drunk, a fire was made in the middle of the enclosure in which they had encamped. <br>
<sup>48</sup>The wood used for that purpose consisted of sticks about two and a half feet long which the poor people of the surrounding country had brought hither in well-arranged bundles, as if prepared expressly for travelers. <br>
<sup>49</sup>The Kings constructed a three-cornered log pile and laid the sticks around the top, leaving an opening on one side to admit air. <br>
<sup>50</sup>The pile was very skillfully put together. <br>
<sup>51</sup>But I cannot say for certain how they lit the fire. <br>
<sup>52</sup>I saw one of them put one piece of wood into another, as if into a box, swing it round and round a little while, and then draw it forth burning. <br>
<sup>53</sup>And so they kindled a fire, and then I saw them killing some birds and roasting them.<br>
<sup>54</sup>The Three Kings and the ancients acted, each one in his own family, like the father of the house, cutting up the food and helping it around. <br>
<sup>55</sup>The carved birds and little loaves were laid on small dishes, or plates, which stood upon little feet, and passed around; and in the same way, the cups were filled and handed to each one to drink. <br>
<sup>56</sup>The lowest among the servants, of whom some were Moors, reclined on the bare earth. <br>
<sup>57</sup>They appeared to be slaves. <br>
<sup>58</sup>The simplicity, the kindness, the good nature of the Kings and nobles, were unspeakably touching. <br>
<sup>59</sup>They gave to the people who gathered around them something of all that they had; they even held out to them the golden vessels and let them drink like children.<br>
<sup>60</sup>Mensor, the brownish, was a Chaldean. <br>
<sup>61</sup>His city, whose name sounded to me something like Acajaja, was surrounded by a river, and appeared to be built on an island. <br>
<sup>62</sup>Mensor spent most of his time in the fields with his herds. <br>
<sup>63</sup>After the death of Christ, he was baptized by St. <br>
<sup>64</sup>Thomas, and named Leander. <br>
<sup>65</sup>Seir, the brown, on that very Christmas night stood prepared at Mensor’s for the expedition. <br>
<sup>66</sup>He and his race were the only ones so brown, but they had red lips. <br>
<sup>67</sup>The other people in the neighborhood were white. <br>
<sup>68</sup>Seir had the baptism of desire. <br>
<sup>69</sup>He was not living at the time of Jesus’ journey to the country of the Kings. <br>
<sup>70</sup>Theokeno was from Media, a country more to the north. <br>
<sup>71</sup>It lay like a strip of land further toward the interior and between two seas. <br>
<sup>72</sup>Theokeno dwelt in his own city; its name I have forgotten. <br>
<sup>73</sup>It consisted of tents erected on stone foundations. <br>
<sup>74</sup>He was the wealthiest of the three. <br>
<sup>75</sup>He might, I think, have taken a more direct route to Bethlehem, but in order to join the others he made a circuitous one. <br>
<sup>76</sup>I think that he had even to pass near Babylon in order to come up with them. <br>
<sup>77</sup>He also was baptized by St. <br>
<sup>78</sup>Thomas and named Leo. <br>
<sup>79</sup>The names Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar were given to the kings, because they so well suited them, for Caspar means “He is won by love”; Melchior, “He is so coaxing, so insinuating, he uses so much address, he approaches one so gently”; Balthasar, “With his whole will, he accomplishes the will of God.”<br>
<sup>80</sup>From Mensor’s city, Seir dwelt at the distance of a three days’ journey, each day counting twelve hours; and Theokeno further on, at a distance of five such days. <br>
<sup>81</sup>Mensor and Seir were together when they saw in the stars the vision of the birth of Jesus, and both set out on the following day with their respective caravans. <br>
<sup>82</sup>Theokeno, also, had the same vision in his own home, and he hurried to join the other two. <br>
<sup>83</sup>Their journey to Bethlehem was about seven hundred and some odd hours. <br>
<sup>84</sup>In the odd number, six occurs. <br>
<sup>85</sup>It was a journey of about sixty days, each day twelve hours long; but they accomplished it in thirty-three days, on account of the great speed of their camels, and because they often travelled day and night.<br>
<sup>86</sup>The star that guided them was like a ball from whose lower surface light streamed as from an open mouth. <br>
<sup>87</sup>It always appeared to me as if guided by an apparition that held it by a thread of light. <br>
<sup>88</sup>By day I saw walking before the caravan a figure more brilliant than the light of the sun. <br>
<sup>89</sup>When I reflect upon the length of the journey, the rapidity with which they made it appears to me astonishing. <br>
<sup>90</sup>But those beasts have so light and even a step that their march looks to me as orderly and as swift, their movements as uniform, as the flight of birds of passage. <br>
<sup>91</sup>The homes of the Three Kings formed a triangle with one another. <br>
<sup>92</sup>Mensor and Seir dwelt nearest to each other; Theokeno was the most distant.<br>
<sup>93</sup>When the caravan had rested till evening, the people that had followed helped to load the beasts again, and then carried off home all that the travelers left behind them. <br>
<sup>94</sup>When the caravan set out, the star was visible, shining with a reddish light, like the moon in windy weather. <br>
<sup>95</sup>Its train of light was pale and long. <br>
<sup>96</sup>The Kings and their followers went part of the way on foot beside their animals, praying with heads uncovered. <br>
<sup>97</sup>The road here was such as to prevent their travelling quickly; but when it became level, they mounted and pushed on at a swift rate. <br>
<sup>98</sup>Sometimes they slackened their pace and all sang together, the sound of their voices on the night air producing a most touching effect. <br>
<sup>99</sup>When I gazed upon them riding forward in such order, their hearts filled with joy and devotion, I could not help thinking: “Ah, if our processions could only pattern after this!” Once I saw them passing the night in a field near a spring. <br>
<sup>100</sup>A man from one of the huts in the neighborhood unlocked it for them. <br>
<sup>101</sup>They watered their beasts and, without unpacking, refreshed themselves by a short rest.<br>
<sup>102</sup>Again I saw the caravan upon a high plateau. <br>
<sup>103</sup>On their right extended a mountain chain, and it seemed to me that they were drawing near to a point in the road where it again made a descent to a thickly settled district whose houses lay among trees and fountains. <br>
<sup>104</sup>The inhabitants of this place wove covers out of threads stretched from tree to tree, and adored images of oxen. <br>
<sup>105</sup>They bountifully supplied food to the crowd that followed the caravan, but the dishes out of which they ate were used no more. <br>
<sup>106</sup>I was surprised at that.<br>
<sup>107</sup>The next day I saw the Kings near a city whose name sounded like Causur, and which was built of tents on stone foundations. <br>
<sup>108</sup>They stopped to rest with the king to whom the city belonged, and whose tent palace lay at a little distance. <br>
<sup>109</sup>The Three Kings had since their meeting travelled fifty-three or sixty-three hours. <br>
<sup>110</sup>They told the king of Causur all that they had seen in the stars. <br>
<sup>111</sup>He was very greatly astonished. <br>
<sup>112</sup>He looked through a tube at the star that was guiding them, and in it he saw a little Child with a Cross.<br>
<sup>113</sup>He begged them, in consequence, to inform him on their return of all that they discovered, that he might erect altars and offer sacrifice to the Child. <br>
<sup>114</sup>On the Kings’ departure from Causur, they were joined by a considerable train of nobles, who were going to travel the same way. <br>
<sup>115</sup>Later they rested at a spring and made a fire, but they did not unload their camels. <br>
<sup>116</sup>When again on their way, I heard them softly and sweetly singing together short strophes, such as: “Over the mountains we shall go. <br>
<sup>117</sup>And before the new King kneel!”
<sup>118</sup>One of them began and the others took up and sang with him the strophes, which they in turn composed and intoned. <br>
<sup>119</sup>In the center of the star was plainly visible a little Child with a Cross.<br>
<sup>120</sup>Mary had a vision of the Kings’ approach when they were resting a day in Causur, and she told it to Joseph and Elizabeth.<br>
<sup>121</sup>At last I saw the Kings arrive at the first Jewish city, a small, straggling place where many of the houses were surrounded by high hedges. <br>
<sup>122</sup>They were here in a straight line from Bethlehem, notwithstanding which they proceeded along toward the right as the streets ran in that direction. <br>
<sup>123</sup>As they entered this place, they sang more sweetly than ever and were full of joy, for the star was here shining upon them with unusual brilliancy, although the moonlight was so bright that one could see shadows distinctly. <br>
<sup>124</sup>The inhabitants of the city, however, either did not see the star, or they took no special notice of it. <br>
<sup>125</sup>They were exceedingly obliging. <br>
<sup>126</sup>When some of the cavalcade dismounted, they assisted them greatly in watering their camels. <br>
<sup>127</sup>It reminded me of Abraham’s time, for then people were all so good and ready to assist one another. <br>
<sup>128</sup>Many of them, bearing branches in their hands, led the caravan through the city and even went a part of the way with them. <br>
<sup>129</sup>The star was not constantly shining before them; sometimes it was quite dull. <br>
<sup>130</sup>It appeared to shine out more clearly wherever good people lived; and when the travelers beheld it more brilliant than usual, their hearts were filled with emotion thinking that there, perhaps, they would find the Messiah. <br>
<sup>131</sup>The Kings were not without apprehension lest their large caravan would create notice and comment.<br>
<sup>132</sup>The next day they went without halting around a dark, foggy city and, at a short distance from it, crossed a river which empties into the Dead Sea. <br>
<sup>133</sup>That evening, I saw them enter a city whose name sounded like Manathea, or Madian. <br>
<sup>134</sup>Their caravan was now perhaps two hundred strong, so great was the crowd their generosity drew after them. <br>
<sup>135</sup>A street ran through this last place, the inhabitants of which consisted partly of Jews, partly of heathens. <br>
<sup>136</sup>The caravan was led into the space between the city and its surrounding wall, and there the Kings pitched their tents. <br>
<sup>137</sup>I saw here, as in the former city, how anxious they became when they discovered that no one knew anything of the newborn King, and I heard them telling how long the star had been looked for among them.</p><br>
 


<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Genealogy of the Kings</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>I heard that the Three Kings traced their genealogy back to Job, who had dwelt on the Caucasus and had jurisdiction over other districts far and wide. <br>
<sup>2</sup>Long before Balaam, and before Abraham’s sojourn in Egypt, they had the prophecy of the star and the hope of its fulfillment. <br>
<sup>3</sup>The leaders of a race from the land of Job had upon an expedition to Egypt, in the region of Heliopolis, received from an angel the revelation that from a virgin the Saviour would be born whom their descendants would honor. <br>
<sup>4</sup>They were also instructed to go no farther, but to return to their homes and watch the stars. <br>
<sup>5</sup>They celebrated festivals in memory of the event, erected altars and triumphal arches which they adorned with flowers, and then turned back home. <br>
<sup>6</sup>There may, perhaps, have been three thousand of these people collected together at this time. <br>
<sup>7</sup>They were dwellers in Media and star worshippers, of a beautiful, yellowish-brown color and of tall and noble stature. <br>
<sup>8</sup>They roamed from place to place with their herds, ruling wherever they pleased by their irresistible power. <br>
<sup>9</sup>They had, as the Kings now related, been the first to announce the prophecy to their people, and the first to introduce among them the observation of the stars. <br>
<sup>10</sup>When both the prophecy and the study had fallen into general oblivion, they were received first by one of Balaam’s scholars, and long after him by three prophetesses, the daughters of the Three Kings’ forefathers. <br>
<sup>11</sup>And now at last, five hundred years since the time of those prophetesses, the star had appeared which they were to follow.<br>
<sup>12</sup>Those three prophetesses were contemporary. <br>
<sup>13</sup>They were deeply versed in the stars; they had visions and the spirit of prophecy. <br>
<sup>14</sup>They foresaw that a star would arise out of Jacob and that an inviolate Virgin would bring forth the Saviour. <br>
<sup>15</sup>Clothed in long garments, they went about the country announcing this prophecy, exhorting to good, foretelling the future down to the most remote ages, and promising that messengers from the Saviour would come to their people and lead them to the worship of the true God. <br>
<sup>16</sup>The fathers of these virgins built a temple to the promised Mother of God on the spot where their lands joined, and in its vicinity a tower from which to observe the constellations and their various changes. <br>
<sup>17</sup>From these three princes, about five hundred years after and through a lineal descent of fifteen generations, sprang the Holy Kings. <br>
<sup>18</sup>It was by their intermingling with other races that they became so different in color. <br>
<sup>19</sup>For a length of time, some of their ancestors were constantly on the tower observing the stars. <br>
<sup>20</sup>What they saw was noted down and taught orally; and, in consequence of these observations, many changes gradually crept into their temple and worship.<br>
<sup>21</sup>All periods remarkable on account of their reference to the coming of the Messiah were pointed out to them by visions in the stars. <br>
<sup>22</sup>During the last year since Mary’s Conception, these visions were more and more significant, and the coming of salvation more explicitly shown. <br>
<sup>23</sup>At the time of the Blessed Virgin’s Conception, they saw the Virgin with the scepter and the scales in whose evenly balanced plates lay wheat and grapes. <br>
<sup>24</sup>They saw, too, a prefiguration of the bitter Passion itself, for they beheld the newborn King involved in a war from which He came out victorious over all His enemies.<br>
<sup>25</sup>This observing of the stars was accompanied by religious ceremonies, fasting, prayer, purification, and self-denial. <br>
<sup>26</sup>They watched not one star alone, but a whole constellation; by certain coincidences among the different stars as they gazed, were formed the visions and pictures that they saw. <br>
<sup>27</sup>The wicked, engaging in this star worship, were affected by evil influences and thrown into convulsions by their demoniacal visions. <br>
<sup>28</sup>It was by the agency of such people that the practice arose of sacrificing the aged and little children. <br>
<sup>29</sup>But such cruelties gradually fell into disuse. <br>
<sup>30</sup>The Kings saw the visions clearly and from them tasted sweet, interior consolation, without feeling the effects of any malign influence. <br>
<sup>31</sup>They became, on the contrary, better and more pious. <br>
<sup>32</sup>With great simplicity and candor, they described what they saw to their inquisitive auditors; but when they perceived that what their forefathers had so patiently awaited for two thousand years was not received with implicit belief, they became sad. <br>
<sup>33</sup>The star was hidden by a cloud; but when it again appeared, looking so large among the drifting clouds and so near to the earth, the Kings arose from their couches, called the people of the city together, and pointed it out to them. <br>
<sup>34</sup>The people gazed awestruck; some were deeply impressed, others were vexed at the Kings for disturbing their rest, while the majority sought but to profit by the princely bounty.<br>
<sup>35</sup>I heard the royal travelers saying how far they had journeyed up to this time. <br>
<sup>36</sup>They reckoned the day’s journey on foot as one of twelve hours. <br>
<sup>37</sup>Before reaching their place of meeting, one had made a journey of three such days, the other five of twelve hours. <br>
<sup>38</sup>But on their beasts, which were dromedaries, subtracting the night and the hours of rest, they could treble that distance; therefore the three days’ journey on foot up to the place of meeting were equivalent to only one, and the five days counted but for two. <br>
<sup>39</sup>From that place to where they were at present they had made a fifty-six days’ journey of twelve hours, or six hundred and seventy-two hours. <br>
<sup>40</sup>They had, therefore, from Christ’s birth up to the present, counting the days that passed until they met and those devoted to resting, consumed about twenty-five days. <br>
<sup>41</sup>At this place also, they took a day to rest.<br>
<sup>42</sup>The people here were singularly importunate and shameless; they pressed around the Kings like swarms of wasps. <br>
<sup>43</sup>The royal travelers dealt out to them freely small triangular yellow pieces like tin and also darker grains. <br>
<sup>44</sup>They must have possessed unnumbered treasures. <br>
<sup>45</sup>When the caravan was departing, it wound around the city, in which I saw idols standing in the temple. <br>
<sup>46</sup>On the opposite side they crossed a bridge and went through a little Jewish place that contained a synagogue. <br>
<sup>47</sup>And now they were on a good road, hastening toward the Jordan. <br>
<sup>48</sup>About one hundred persons had joined their caravan. <br>
<sup>49</sup>They had still a journey of about twenty-four hours to Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>50</sup>But I saw them passing through no more cities, and they were met but by few people, as it was the Sabbath. <br>
<sup>51</sup>The nearer they drew to Jerusalem, the more disheartened they became; for the star no longer shone with its usual brightness and, since their entrance into Judea, they saw it but seldom. <br>
<sup>52</sup>They had hoped also to find the people on their route exulting with joy and celebrating with magnificence the birth of the newborn Saviour, to honor whom they themselves had come so far. <br>
<sup>53</sup>But beholding no sign of excitement, they grew anxious and perplexed, thinking that, perhaps, after all they had made a mistake.<br>
<sup>54</sup>It may have been midday when they crossed the Jordan. <br>
<sup>55</sup>They paid the ferrymen, though only two of them lent a helping hand. <br>
<sup>56</sup>They held back and let them attend to their transportation themselves. <br>
<sup>57</sup>The Jordan was not broad at that time and it was full of sandbanks. <br>
<sup>58</sup>Boards were laid over crossbeams, and the dromedaries stood upon them. <br>
<sup>59</sup>The passage across the river was made expeditiously. <br>
<sup>60</sup>The Kings first appeared to be going toward Bethlehem, but soon they turned and went on to Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>61</sup>I saw the city towering up high against the sky. <br>
<sup>62</sup>The Sabbath was over before the caravan arrived outside the city.</p><br>



<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Kings Before Herod</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>The caravan of the Kings took about a quarter of an hour to pass any given point. <br>
<sup>2</sup>When it halted before Jerusalem, the star had become invisible; consequently, the travelers were very much troubled. <br>
<sup>3</sup>The Kings rode upon dromedaries, and three other dromedaries were laden with the baggage. <br>
<sup>4</sup>The rest of the cavalcade were mounted upon nimble animals of a yellowish color with small heads, I know not whether they were horses or asses, but they were very different in appearance from our horses. <br>
<sup>5</sup>The animals upon which the nobles rode were very handsomely caparisoned and hung with golden stars and little chains. <br>
<sup>6</sup>Some of the followers went to the gate of the city, and returned with officers and soldiers. <br>
<sup>7</sup>The arrival of the Kings at that time when no feast was being celebrated, when no special commercial interest seemed to bring them, and also by that particular road, was something remarkable. <br>
<sup>8</sup>They explained to the officials why they had come, and spoke of the star and the Child. <br>
<sup>9</sup>But their hearers were ignorant on the subject, and so the Kings began again to think that they had surely erred, since they could not find one person who looked as if he knew anything connected with the Redemption of the world. <br>
<sup>10</sup>The people gazed at them in wonder, unable to conceive what they wanted. <br>
<sup>11</sup>The Kings explained that they were ready to pay for whatever they got from them, and that they wished to confer with their King. <br>
<sup>12</sup>And now arose great hurrying to and fro, the travelers meantime interchanging questions and answers with the crowd gathered around them. <br>
<sup>13</sup>Some had indeed heard of a child that was to be born at Bethlehem; but they were poor, ignorant people, and their words had no weight. <br>
<sup>14</sup>Others laughed derisively and the Kings grew troubled and disheartened; and then they perceived by the expressions of the people that Herod knew nothing of what they sought and that he was by no means beloved by his subjects. <br>
<sup>15</sup>They became anxious as to how they should address him. <br>
<sup>16</sup>They had recourse to prayer, their courage revived, and they said to one another: “He who has brought us so quickly here by means of the star, will also lead us home in safety.”<br>
<sup>17</sup>They now led the caravan around the city and brought it in at the side nearer Mount Calvary. <br>
<sup>18</sup>Not far from the fish market, they and their animals were conducted into a circular court, which was surrounded by halls and dwellings, and before whose gates guards were standing. <br>
<sup>19</sup>In the middle of the court was a well, at which they watered the beasts, and all found quarters in the stalls and places under the arches. <br>
<sup>20</sup>On one side of the court arose the mountain on which it lay; on the other, it was free and shaded by trees. <br>
<sup>21</sup>I saw people coming with torches and examining the baggage.<br>
<sup>22</sup>Herod’s palace stood higher up the mountain not far from this court. <br>
<sup>23</sup>I saw the road leading to it lighted up by torches and lanterns hung on poles. <br>
<sup>24</sup>I saw officials going down from the palace and conducting thither Theokeno, the eldest of the Kings. <br>
<sup>25</sup>He was received under an archway and ushered into a hall. <br>
<sup>26</sup>There he made known his errand to a courtier, who reported it to Herod. <br>
<sup>27</sup>Herod became almost insane at the news, and gave orders for the Kings to present themselves before him on the following morning. <br>
<sup>28</sup>He also sent word to them to rest while he made inquiries, and he would inform them of the result.<br>
<sup>29</sup>When Theokeno returned, he and his two royal companions became still more uneasy, and ordered the baggage that had been unpacked to be packed again. <br>
<sup>30</sup>They slept none that night. <br>
<sup>31</sup>I saw some of them going around the city with guides. <br>
<sup>32</sup>It seemed to me that they suspected Herod of knowing all, but of being unwilling to disclose the truth to them. <br>
<sup>33</sup>They still sought the star. <br>
<sup>34</sup>In Jerusalem itself all was quiet, but there was much running to and fro and questioning among the sentinels at the court.<br>
<sup>35</sup>It may have been about eleven o’clock at night when Theokeno was sent for by Herod. <br>
<sup>36</sup>There appeared to be some kind of festivity going on, for the palace was ablaze with lights, and I saw females in it. <br>
<sup>37</sup>The news brought by Theokeno threw Herod into the greatest terror. <br>
<sup>38</sup>He dispatched servants to the Temple and also into the city, and I saw priests and scribes and aged Jews going to him with rolls of writings under their arms. <br>
<sup>39</sup>They wore their priestly garments, also their breastplates, and their girdles on which letters were inscribed. <br>
<sup>40</sup>There were about twenty around him, expounding the writings. <br>
<sup>41</sup>I saw them also mounting with him to the roof of the palace and gazing at the stars. <br>
<sup>42</sup>Herod was very uneasy and perplexed. <br>
<sup>43</sup>But the scribes tried to divert him, by endeavoring to prove that there was nothing in the talk of the Kings; that those Eastern people were always superstitiously raving about the stars; and that, if there was any truth in what they said, surely the priests of the Temple and the dwellers in the Holy City would have known it long ago.<br>
<sup>44</sup>Next morning at daybreak, I saw one of the courtiers going down to the caravan and bringing up all three of the Kings to Herod’s palace. <br>
<sup>45</sup>They were ushered into an apartment around which were pots of foliage and bushes. <br>
<sup>46</sup>Refreshments were spread at the entrance. <br>
<sup>47</sup>But the Kings declined the proffered food, and remained standing until Herod entered. <br>
<sup>48</sup>They approached him with an obeisance, and without preamble put to him the question as to where they should find the newborn King of the Jews, for they had seen His star and they were come to do Him homage. <br>
<sup>49</sup>Herod was very much troubled, but he concealed his fears. <br>
<sup>50</sup>Some of the scribes were still with him. <br>
<sup>51</sup>He questioned the Kings closely concerning the star, and told them that of Bethlehem Ephrata ran the Promise. <br>
<sup>52</sup>But Mensor related to him the last vision they had seen in the star, whereupon Herod’s anxiety became almost too great for concealment. <br>
<sup>53</sup>Mensor said that they had seen a Virgin with a Child lying before her. <br>
<sup>54</sup>From the right side of the Child issued a branch formed of light, upon which stood a tower with many gates, which tower increased in size until it became a city. <br>
<sup>55</sup>The Child appeared standing above it with sword and scepter; and they had seen not only them-selves, but all the kings of the earth, coming to bow down before and adore that Child, for Its kingdom was to vanquish all other kingdoms. <br>
<sup>56</sup>Herod advised them to go quietly and without delay to Bethlehem, and when they had found the Child to return and inform him that he too might go and adore Him. <br>
<sup>57</sup>I saw the Kings going down from the palace, and leaving Jerusalem at once. <br>
<sup>58</sup>The day was dawning, and the lights on the way leading up to the palace were still burning. <br>
<sup>59</sup>The crowd that had followed the royal caravan had passed the night in the city.<br>
<sup>60</sup>Herod who, about the time of Christ’s birth, had gone to his palace at Jericho, had been even before the coming of the Kings very restless and uneasy. <br>
<sup>61</sup>Two of his illegitimate sons had been raised by him to high positions in the Temple. <br>
<sup>62</sup>They were Sadducees, and by them he was kept informed of all that transpired, as well as of all who were opposed to his designs. <br>
<sup>63</sup>Among these he was told of one, a man good and upright, a distinguished functionary of the Temple. <br>
<sup>64</sup>Herod sent him a courteous and friendly invitation to come to him in Jericho. <br>
<sup>65</sup>When the good man was on his way to comply with the invitation, Herod’s creatures fell upon him and murdered him in the desert, making it appear as if robbers had perpetrated the awful deed. <br>
<sup>66</sup>Some days later, Herod returned to Jerusalem, in order to take part in the Feast of the Consecration of the Temple. <br>
<sup>67</sup>Then he thought he would, in his own way, give pleasure to the Jews and show them honor. <br>
<sup>68</sup>He caused to be made a golden figure something like a lamb, though still more like a goat, for it had horns. <br>
<sup>69</sup>This figure was to be erected above the gate leading from the outer court of the women into the court of sacrifice. <br>
<sup>70</sup>Herod insisted upon this and, moreover, expected to be thanked for what he had done. <br>
<sup>71</sup>But the priests resisted. <br>
<sup>72</sup>Herod threatened them with a fine. <br>
<sup>73</sup>They replied that the fine indeed they would pay; but that the figure, according to their Law, they could never accept. <br>
<sup>74</sup>Herod fell into a rage, and ordered it to be set up secretly. <br>
<sup>75</sup>Thereupon, one of the officers of the Temple, fired with zeal, seized it as it was being brought in, cleft it in twain, and hurled it to the ground. <br>
<sup>76</sup>This gave rise to a tumult, and Herod ordered the offender to be imprisoned. <br>
<sup>77</sup>Herod was, on account of this affair, extremely displeased, and regretted having come to the feast; but his courtiers sought by all kinds of diversions to remove the impression from his mind.<br>
<sup>78</sup>There was among some pious people in Judea the expectation of the near advent of the Messiah, and the circumstances attendant on the birth of Jesus had been noised abroad by the shepherds. <br>
<sup>79</sup>Herod had heard all and had at Bethlehem made secret inquiries into it. <br>
<sup>80</sup>His spies, however, having found only poor Joseph, and having besides orders not to attract attention, reported that it was nothing, that they had found only a poor family buried in a cave, and the whole affair not worth talking about. <br>
<sup>81</sup>But now, all of a sudden, appeared the great caravan of the Kings. <br>
<sup>82</sup>Their questioning after the King of Judah was marked by such confidence and precision, they spoke with such certainty of the star, that Herod could scarcely hide his anxious perplexity. <br>
<sup>83</sup>He hoped to learn the particulars of the affair from the Kings themselves, and then take measures accordingly. <br>
<sup>84</sup>But when the Kings, warned by God, did not return, he explained their flight as a consequence of their falsehood and disappointment; they were, he thought, ashamed to come back and be looked upon as fools. <br>
<sup>85</sup>He therefore caused to be proclaimed in Bethlehem and in a general way, that the people should have nothing to do with the strangers. <br>
<sup>86</sup>When he thought to make away with Jesus, he found that He was no longer in Nazareth. <br>
<sup>87</sup>He caused search to be made after Him for a long time. <br>
<sup>88</sup>When he had to give up all hope of finding Him and his anxiety was, in consequence, so much the more increased, he took the desperate resolution to murder all the children. <br>
<sup>89</sup>He was so cautious in executing his measures that he transported his troops beforehand, in order to avoid any insurrection.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Kings Arrive at Bethlehem</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>I saw the Kings leaving Jerusalem in the same order in which they had come. <br>
<sup>2</sup>They left by a gate to the south: first, Mensor, the youngest; then Seir, and lastly, Theokeno. <br>
<sup>3</sup>They were followed by a crowd as far as a brook outside the city, and here the rabble left them and turned back home. <br>
<sup>4</sup>On the opposite side of the brook, the Kings halted and looked for their star. <br>
<sup>5</sup>To their great joy, they saw it, and on again they went, singing sweetly. <br>
<sup>6</sup>But what I wondered at was, that the star did not guide them by a direct route from Jerusalem to Bethlehem; they went more to the west and passed a little city that is well known to me. <br>
<sup>7</sup>Beyond the same, I saw them halting at a beautiful place to pray. <br>
<sup>8</sup>A well sprang up before them; they dismounted and dug a basin for the water, surrounding it with sand and sods. <br>
<sup>9</sup>They remained here several hours and watered their beasts; for in Jerusalem, on account of their anxiety and trouble, they had had no rest.<br>
<sup>10</sup>The star, which by night looked like a globe of light, now had the appearance of the moon when seen by day; but still it did not appear exactly round, but somewhat pointed. <br>
<sup>11</sup>I saw that it was often hidden behind the clouds.<br>
<sup>12</sup>The highroad between Bethlehem and Jerusalem swarmed with people, travelers with their baggage on asses. <br>
<sup>13</sup>They were, perhaps, on account of the census, returning from Bethlehem to distant homes, or going up to Jerusalem to the Temple or the markets. <br>
<sup>14</sup>But on the route taken by the Kings, it was very quiet. <br>
<sup>15</sup>Perhaps the star guided them that way, that they might escape notice, and arrive in Bethlehem in the evening.<br>
<sup>16</sup>It was twilight when the caravan drew up before Bethlehem at the same gate at which Mary and Joseph had stopped. <br>
<sup>17</sup>When the star had disappeared, the Kings went to the house, the former abode of Joseph’s parents, and in which Joseph and Mary had recently been inscribed. <br>
<sup>18</sup>Here they thought they were to find the newborn King. <br>
<sup>19</sup>It was a spacious mansion with numerous small buildings around it, an enclosed courtyard in front, and stretching beyond that a lawn with trees and a fountain. <br>
<sup>20</sup>I saw on the lawn Roman soldiers, because of the tax offices in the house. <br>
<sup>21</sup>Crowds of people thronged around the newcomers whose beasts were being watered under the trees near the fountain. <br>
<sup>22</sup>The Kings and their followers dismounted. <br>
<sup>23</sup>The people showed them every mark of respect; they were not rude to them as they had been to Joseph. <br>
<sup>24</sup>They presented green branches, and supplied them with food and drink; but I could see that that was principally in consideration of the gold pieces which the Kings were freely disbursing.<br>
<sup>25</sup>I saw the travelers tarrying long in doubt and anxiety. <br>
<sup>26</sup>At last, I saw a light rising in the heavens on the opposite side of Bethlehem over the region of the Crib. <br>
<sup>27</sup>The light was like that of the rising moon. <br>
<sup>28</sup>I saw the caravan again set out and wind around the south side of Bethlehem toward the east, thus bringing on one hand the field in which Christ’s birth had been announced to the shepherds. <br>
<sup>29</sup>They had to go around a ditch and some ruined walls. <br>
<sup>30</sup>They had made choice of this route, because they had while in Bethlehem been directed to the valley of the shepherds as a good place for encamping. <br>
<sup>31</sup>Some of the Bethlehemites followed the cavalcade, but the Kings said nothing to them of the object of their search.<br>
<sup>32</sup>St. Joseph appeared to know of their arrival. <br>
<sup>33</sup>Whether he had learned it through someone from Jerusalem, or in vision, I know not; but I saw him during the day bringing all kinds of things from Bethlehem, fruit, honey, and vegetables. <br>
<sup>34</sup>I saw him also clearing out the cave, making more room, taking away the partitions that cut off his own little sleeping place from the passage, and stowing away the wood and the cooking utensils under the shed before the door. <br>
<sup>35</sup>When the caravan had filed down into the valley of the Crib Cave, all dismounted and began to set up their tents while the people that had crowded after them from Bethlehem returned to the city. <br>
<sup>36</sup>The encampment was partly pitched when over the cave shone out the star and in it a Child plainly visible. <br>
<sup>37</sup>It stood directly above the Crib, its stream of light falling straight down upon it. <br>
<sup>38</sup>The Kings and their followers uncovered their heads and watched it sinking lower and lower, increasing in size as it approached the earth. <br>
<sup>39</sup>It looked to me as large as a sheet, I think. <br>
<sup>40</sup>All were at first amazed. <br>
<sup>41</sup>It was already dark; no dwelling was to be seen around, only the hill of the Crib Cave, looking like a rampart on the plain. <br>
<sup>42</sup>But soon their amazement turned to joy, and they sought the entrance of the cave. <br>
<sup>43</sup>Mensor pushed back the door and there, in the upper end of the cave, which was resplendent with light, he beheld Mary sitting with the Child, and looking just like the Virgin they had so often seen in the star pictures. <br>
<sup>44</sup>Mensor stepped back and told his companions what he had seen, then all three entered the passage. <br>
<sup>45</sup>I saw Joseph coming out to them with an old shepherd, and speaking to them in quite a friendly way. <br>
<sup>46</sup>The Kings told him in a few words that they had come to adore the newborn King of the Jews whose star they had seen, and bring Him gifts. <br>
<sup>47</sup>Joseph humbly bade them welcome, and they went back to their tents, in order to prepare themselves for the ceremony of their presentation. <br>
<sup>48</sup>The old shepherd accompanied the Kings’ servants to the little valley behind the hill, where there were sheds and shepherd stalls, in order to care for the beasts. <br>
<sup>49</sup>The caravan filled the whole of the little valley.<br>
<sup>50</sup>And now I saw the Kings taking down from the camels and putting on their wide, flowing mantles of yellow silk. <br>
<sup>51</sup>They fastened around their girdles with little chains, bags, and golden boxes with knobs, that looked to me like sugar bowls. <br>
<sup>52</sup>They, along with the flowing mantles, made them look quite broad. <br>
<sup>53</sup>They took also a little table with low feet that could be opened and folded at pleasure. <br>
<sup>54</sup>It served as a salver. <br>
<sup>55</sup>A cloth with tasseled fringe was thrown over it, and on it placed the boxes and dishes containing the gifts.<br>
<sup>56</sup>Each King was accompanied by his four relatives. <br>
<sup>57</sup>All followed St. <br>
<sup>58</sup>Joseph with some of their servants to the shed before the entrance to the cave. <br>
<sup>59</sup>Here they spread the cloth over the table and stood on it several of the boxes they had hanging at their girdles, to be presented as their gifts in common. <br>
<sup>60</sup>Then two youths of Mensor’s train went in at the door, laid down strips of carpet all the way up to the Crib, and withdrew to a distance. <br>
<sup>61</sup>And now Mensor and his four companions entered, having previously laid aside their sandals. <br>
<sup>62</sup>Two servants bore the table with the gifts through the passage up to the Crib Cave; but at the entrance, Mensor took it from them, carried it in himself, and on bended knee placed it at Mary’s feet. <br>
<sup>63</sup>The other Kings and their companions remained standing at the entrance.<br>
<sup>64</sup>I saw the cave filled with supernatural light. <br>
<sup>65</sup>Opposite the entrance and on the spot where Jesus was born, was Mary leaning on one arm in a posture more reclining than sitting; by her side was Joseph, and on her right, in a raised trough with a cover thrown over it, lay the Infant Jesus. <br>
<sup>66</sup>At Mensor’s entrance, Mary rose to a sitting posture, drew her veil around her, and took the Child, which she enveloped in its folds, upon her lap. <br>
<sup>67</sup>But she drew the veil aside sufficiently to allow the Child to be seen as far as below the little arms. <br>
<sup>68</sup>She held It upright leaning against her breast, Its little head supported by her hand. <br>
<sup>69</sup>The Infant folded Its little hands upon Its breast as if in prayer. <br>
<sup>70</sup>It was shining with light, was very gracious, and at times extended Its little hands, as if grasping something. <br>
<sup>71</sup>Mensor fell on his knees before Mary, bowed his head, crossed his hands on his breast, and offered the gifts with some reverent words. <br>
<sup>72</sup>Then he took from the bag at his girdle a handful of little metal bars, about a finger in length, thick and heavy. <br>
<sup>73</sup>They were pointed at the upper end, granular in the middle, and shone like gold. <br>
<sup>74</sup>He laid them humbly on Mary’s lap by the Child, as his gift to her. <br>
<sup>75</sup>Mary accepted them graciously and humbly, and covered them with the end of her mantle. <br>
<sup>76</sup>Mensor’s companions stood behind him with heads lowly bowed. <br>
<sup>77</sup>Mensor gave gold, because he was full of love and confidence, and had always with unshaken devotion and untiring efforts, sought after salvation.<br>
<sup>78</sup>When Mensor and his companions withdrew, Seir with his four relatives entered and knelt. <br>
<sup>79</sup>He carried in his hand a golden censer, in shape like a boat, filled with small, greenish grains like resin. <br>
<sup>80</sup>He gave incense, for he was the one that clung to God, voluntarily, reverently, and lovingly following His Will. <br>
<sup>81</sup>He placed his gift upon the little table, and knelt long in adoration.<br>
<sup>82</sup>After Seir, came Theokeno, the eldest of the Kings. <br>
<sup>83</sup>He could not kneel, because he was too old and stout. <br>
<sup>84</sup>He stood bowing low, and laid upon the table a little golden ship in which was a fine, green herb. <br>
<sup>85</sup>It was fresh and living, stood erect like a delicate green bush, and had small white flowers. <br>
<sup>86</sup>Theokeno offered myrrh, for myrrh is typical of mortification and vanquished passions. <br>
<sup>87</sup>This good man had had to struggle against severe temptations to idolatry and polygamy. <br>
<sup>88</sup>He remained very long before the Infant Jesus, so long that I felt anxious for the good people, the Kings’ followers, who at the entrance were so patiently awaiting their turn to see the Child.<br>
<sup>89</sup>The words of the Kings and their followers were extraordinarily simple and childlike; they were as if inebriated with love. <br>
<sup>90</sup>They always began: “We have seen His star and that He is King over all kings. <br>
<sup>91</sup>We have come to adore Him and to bring Him gifts.”<br>
<sup>92</sup> With the tenderest tears and most fervent prayers, they commended to the Child Jesus themselves, their goods, and property, all that they valued on earth. <br>
<sup>93</sup>They begged Him to take their hearts, their souls, their actions, their thoughts; they entreated Him to enlighten them, to bestow upon them all the virtues, and to the whole earth to grant peace, happiness, and love. <br>
<sup>94</sup>They were glowing with love. <br>
<sup>95</sup>No words could depict their ardor and humility, nor the tears of joy that bathed their cheeks and flowed down the beard of the eldest. <br>
<sup>96</sup>They were perfectly happy; they believed that, at last, they had entered into the star after which their forefathers had so long legitimately sighed, and at which they themselves had so longingly gazed. <br>
<sup>97</sup>All the joy of the promise of many hundreds of years now fulfilled, welled up in their hearts.<br>
<sup>98</sup>Joseph and Mary also wept. <br>
<sup>99</sup>I never before had seen them so full of joy. <br>
<sup>100</sup>The honor paid their Child and Saviour and the recognition of Him by the Kings, of that Child for whom their poverty could afford so poor a couch, of that Child the knowledge of whose high dignity lay hidden in the silent humility of their own hearts—all that comforted them immeasurably. <br>
<sup>101</sup>They saw brought to Him from so great a distance by God’s almighty power, and in spite of the machinations of man, what they themselves could not procure for Him, viz.,<br>
<sup>102</sup> the adoration of the great, and magnificent gifts offered with holy profusion. <br>
<sup>103</sup>Ah! They adored with those great ones, and the honor their Child received inundated their heart with exceedingly great joy.<br>
<sup>104</sup>The Mother of God accepted everything most humbly and thankfully. <br>
<sup>105</sup>She spoke not, but the movement of her veiled head told all. <br>
<sup>106</sup>The Infant Jesus lay on her mantle and covered by her veil, through which His little form shone brightly. <br>
<sup>107</sup>It was only at the close of their visit that the Blessed Virgin addressed some kind words to each, throwing her veil back a little as she spoke.<br>
<sup>108</sup>The Kings now returned to their tents, which were lighted up and looked very beautiful.<br>
<sup>109</sup>At last, the good servants arrived at the Crib. <br>
<sup>110</sup>During the adoration of the Kings, they had with Joseph’s help erected a white tent on the hill toward the shepherd field to the left of the Crib Cave. <br>
<sup>111</sup>They had brought with them on their beasts of burden the tent with all its covers and poles, the latter of which fitted into one another. <br>
<sup>112</sup>At first I thought that Joseph had put it up, and I began to wonder where he had got it so quickly and opportunely; but when the caravan was about to leave, I saw that tent taken down and packed up with the rest. <br>
<sup>113</sup>There was a kind of shed of straw matting put up in it, under which the chests were placed. <br>
<sup>114</sup>After the servants had pitched the tent and arranged all things in it, they took their stand at the door of the Crib Cave, humbly awaiting admittance.<br>
<sup>115</sup>And now they began to enter, five at a time, accompanied by one of the nobles to whom they belonged. <br>
<sup>116</sup>They knelt before Mary, and silently adored the Child. <br>
<sup>117</sup>Lastly, came the boys in their little mantles, and then there may have been in all about thirty persons present.<br>
<sup>118</sup>When all had withdrawn, the Kings again came in together. <br>
<sup>119</sup>They had changed their mantles for others of raw silk, white and flowing, and they carried censers and incense. <br>
<sup>120</sup>Two servants had previously laid down over the floor of the cave, a carpet of a deep red color, on which Mary sat with the Child while the Kings offered incense. <br>
<sup>121</sup>This carpet Mary kept ever afterward. <br>
<sup>122</sup>She walked on it, and took it with her on the ass to Jerusalem when she went there for her Purification. <br>
<sup>123</sup>The Kings incensed the Child, Mary, Joseph, and the whole cave. <br>
<sup>124</sup>This was with them a ceremony expressive of veneration.<br>
<sup>125</sup>I saw the Kings afterward in the tent reclining on a carpet around a little low table. <br>
<sup>126</sup>Joseph brought in little plates of fruit, rolls, honeycomb, and small dishes of vegetables. <br>
<sup>127</sup>Then he sat down and ate with them. <br>
<sup>128</sup>He was so delighted, and not at all shamefaced; he wept for joy almost the whole time. <br>
<sup>129</sup>When I saw that, I thought of my own father, and how, at my profession in the convent, he had to sit among so many fine people. <br>
<sup>130</sup>In his humility and simplicity, he had indeed felt intimidated, but it did not prevent his giving vent to his feelings in tears of joy.<br>
<sup>131</sup>When Joseph returned to the Crib Cave, he removed all the rich gifts to a recess at the right of the Crib, where he had screened a little corner from sight. <br>
<sup>132</sup>Anne’s maid who had remained to wait upon Mary, retired to the little cellar like cave on the left of the Crib Cave, and did not come forth until all the visitors had departed. <br>
<sup>133</sup>She was a quiet, modest person. <br>
<sup>134</sup>I saw neither Mary nor Joseph nor the maid examining the gifts or showing any worldly pleasure on their account. <br>
<sup>135</sup>They were accepted with thanks, and with liberality were again distributed to the needy. <br>
<sup>136</sup>That maid was a relative of Anne, and a robust and very serious person.<br>
<sup>137</sup>On this evening and during the night, I saw in Bethlehem only at Joseph’s paternal house a noisy bustling to and fro and, when the Kings entered the city, there was some little excitement; around the Crib Cave all was, at first, very quiet. <br>
<sup>138</sup>After awhile, I saw here and there in the distance Jews lurking and whispering together, and giving notice in the city of what they saw. <br>
<sup>139</sup>I saw also in Jerusalem on this day many old Jews and priests hurrying to and fro with writings to Herod, and then all became quiet as if they wished the subject dropped.<br>
<sup>140</sup>At last, the Kings with their people held, under the cedar over the Suckling Cave, a religious ser-vice. <br>
<sup>141</sup>The singing was most touching, the boys’ sweet voices mingling with those of the elders. <br>
<sup>142</sup>After the service, the Kings went with a part of their followers to a large inn at Bethlehem. <br>
<sup>143</sup>The others slept in the tents between the Crib and the Suckling Cave, which latter they had also taken possession of for the storing of part of their treasures. <br>
<sup>144</sup>The white tent before the Crib was occupied by some of the most distinguished of the nobles.</p><br></p><br>
