        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
       <p>
       <sup>1</sup> According to the God-spoken word which says: "When you heard of wars and rumors of wars, nation will fight against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, earthquakes, plagues and deviations of stars, - Then the bush which restrains the sons of Hagar will dry up. <br>
       <sup>2</sup> And three sons of Hagar will go forth into great Babylonia, (whose ) name(s are) Ouaches, and another Axiaphar, and the third Morphosar. <br>
       <sup>3</sup> And Ishmael will come down the region of the land of swift passage. <br>
       <sup>4</sup> And he will establish his camp in Chalcedon across from Byzantium. <br>
       <sup>5</sup> And the other one will come to Antioch, Cilicia, and Iberian Anatolia, the Thrakysan country and Smyrna and as far as the Seven-hilled (city). <br>
       <sup>6</sup> And he will spill Roman blood. <br>
       <sup>7</sup> And another will come to the region of Persia and (to) the Galilean country, the Armenian border, and the city of frebizond. <br>
       <sup>8</sup> And he will come to the region of the land of the Meropes. <br>
       <sup>9</sup> And he will massacre male children from two and three years old and younger. <br>
       <sup>10</sup> And he will consume them by the sword. <br>
       <sup>11</sup> And the third one will come down the regions of the north and Mesiaspolis and Synopolis, and Zalichos, the regions of Chrysiapetra, and the well-lit valley and Bithynia, and of Daphnousia, Chrysioupolis, and Damoulion and as far as the Seven-hilled (city). </p><br>


       <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
       <p class="chapterTitle"></p>

       <p>
       <sup>1</sup> And therefore all these (will) slaughter an infinite multitude of Romans from two and three years old and younger. <br>
       <sup>2</sup> And they will gather together toward the sea. <br>
       <sup>3</sup> And in their ships (will be) a myriad myriads. <br>
       <sup>4</sup> And there will be other infinite and innumerable multitudes. <br>
       <sup>5</sup> And in that place many will deny our Lord Jesus Christ and the holy gifts and will follow the apostates. <br>
       <sup>6</sup> And every sacrifice will cease from the churches. <br>
       <sup>7</sup> And the liturgy of God will be mocked. <br>
       <sup>8</sup> And the priests will be as laymen. <br>
       <sup>9</sup> And Ishmael will cry out with a great voice, boasting and saying, "Where is the God of the Romans? <br>
       <sup>10</sup> There is no one helping them, for we have defeated them completely." <br>
       <sup>11</sup> For truly the three sons of Hagar will roar against the Romans. <br>
       <sup>12</sup> And they will cross over against the Seven-hilled (city) toward Byzantium. <br>
       <sup>13</sup> And conferring, they will say (among) themselves, "Come and let us make a bridge in the sea with boats and transport horses for ourselves to Byzantium, the Seven-hilled (city)." <br>
       <sup>14</sup> But the rulers of the Romans and the magnates of the Seven-hilled (city) will flee to the glens of the mountains. <br>
       <sup>15</sup> And there will be fear and affliction. <br>
       <sup>16</sup> And there will be much necessity of the mountains."And the people of the Seven-hilled (city) will be afflicted by the sword. <br>
       <sup>17</sup> Woe, woe then. <br>
       <sup>18</sup> How will the orthodox faith of the Christians and the invincible power of the honorable and life-giving cross be overcome?" </p><br>
         
        
      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle"></p>

      <p>
      <sup>1</sup> But hear, brethren, that because of their iniquity God forbears. <br>
      <sup>2</sup> And the first will set up his couch across from Byzantium. <br>
      <sup>3</sup> And he will strike and they will be stricken. <br>
      <sup>4</sup> And then the rulers of the Romans blaspheme, saying, "Woe, woe, neither in heaven do we have a king nor on the earth." <br>
      <sup>5</sup> And with this word the Lord will incline his mercy toward the Romans and toward their revenge and will repay justice to his enemies. <br>
      <sup>6</sup> And there will be a great sound from heaven and a fearful earthquake and a voice from the angel from heaven. <br>
      <sup>7</sup> And the Lord will incline his head and will set his fury against the sons of Hagar and upon the feet of Ishmael. <br>
      <sup>8</sup> And the Lord will lift up the cowardice of the Romans and put (it) into the hearts of Ishmael, and the courage of the Ishmaelites into the hearts of the Romans. <br>
      <sup>9</sup> And the Lord will raise up a king of the Romans, who people say is dead and useful for nothing, who people think died many years before.' <br>
      <sup>10</sup> The Lord is reserving this man in the outer country of Persia. <br>
      <sup>11</sup> This (is) his name: that which (begins with) the letter K of the alphabet. <br>
      <sup>12</sup> And this man is coming to the Seven-hilled city toward the evening." <br>
      <sup>13</sup> And he will prepare for his enemies. <br>
      <sup>14</sup> And on Saturday morning, as the sun rises, he will engage in a great war with the nation and the sons of Hagar, both he and the two small boys. <br>
      <sup>15</sup> And the rulers of the Romans will gather together in Byzantium. <br>
      <sup>16</sup> Then even the priests of the Romans and the bishops and abbots who are found will bear weapons of war. </p><br>


      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle"></p>

      <p>
      <sup>1</sup> And when he has gathered those together with (the) two small boys, that king also will join in a mighty war with the nation of the sons of Hagar. <br>
      <sup>2</sup> And he will massacre them like the grass of a reed being burned by fire. <br>
      <sup>3</sup> And from their blood a three-year-old bull will drown. <br>
      <sup>4</sup> And the king alone will pursue a thousand and the two small boys myriads. <br>
      <sup>5</sup> And Ishmael and the sons of Hagar will be butchered to the end. <br>
      <sup>6</sup> And there will be war and great bloodshed such as has not been since the foundation of the world. <br>
      <sup>7</sup> The blood will be mixed in the sea one and a half miles. <br>
      <sup>8</sup> And in the streets of the Seven-hilled (city) horses will be submerged, drowning in the blood. <br>
      <sup>9</sup> And from that nation and from Ishmael there will remain only three tents of men. <br>
      <sup>10</sup> And (the) sons of Ishmael will serve the Romans to the end and will serve the chief donkey drivers of the Seven-hilled (city for) thirty years. <br>
      <sup>11</sup> And the nature of Ishmael in the sword and in captivity is more bitter and  more grievous beyond that of the Romans. <br>
      <sup>12</sup> And the Roman race will desire to see a trace of Ishmael and will not find (it). <br>
      <sup>13</sup> And then the prophetic word will be fulfilled (that says): <i>"How will one pursue a thousand and two remove myriads unless the Lord God rejected them and the Lord gave them over - Deut. 32:3O </i></p><br>

      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>

      <sup>2</sup> And the scepter of that king will be long-lived, likewise  (that) of the two small boys. <br>
      <sup>3</sup> And his fame will go forth from the east and the west. <br>
      <sup>4</sup> And there will be one empire. <br>
      <sup>5</sup> And no one will resist him because this man has come from God and he will cause all war to cease. <br>
      <sup>6</sup> And there will be great peace. <br>
      <sup>7</sup> And every city and fortresses will be built. <br>
      <sup>8</sup> And there will be many altars acceptable to God in all the civilized world. <br>
      <sup>9</sup> And all the islands and the mountains will be inhabited. <br>
      <sup>10</sup> And the bread and the wine and the olive oil and the gold and the silver will increase in all the earth. <br>
      <sup>11</sup> And that king will cause all hostility to cease upon the earth. <br>
      <sup>12</sup> And they will make their weapons into scythes. <br>
      <sup>13</sup> And his reign will be (for) thirty-six years. <br>
      <sup>14</sup> And the rulers of the Romans will desire to join in war but will not find (it).  <br>
      <sup>15</sup> And all the perimeter(s) of the earth will fear them. <br>
      <sup>16</sup> And that king will glorify God because in his reign God gave to him the good  things of the earth which he did not give since the foundation of the world. <br>
      <sup>17</sup> And is the king will fall asleep in peace. <br>
      <sup>18</sup> And his two small boys will be taken up in peace after thirty-three years. </p><br>

      <sup>3</sup> And he will couple  mother and son and brother and sister. <br>
      <sup>4</sup> And he will bring the monks out of the holy monasteries and will join the monasteries together and will cause the nuns to lie with his nation. <br>
      <sup>5</sup> And he will work great transgressions. <br>
      <sup>6</sup> 'Woe, woe then (to) the Christian race. 'Woe to those who are pregnant. <br>
      <sup>7</sup> And the praises of God also will cease. <br>
      <sup>8</sup> And the Lord God will call fire from heaven and will consume them.' <br>
      <sup>9</sup> And after him a foul and alien woman will reign in the Seven-hilled (city). <br>
      <sup>10</sup> And she will settle on the southern side of the Seven-hilled (city). </p><br>

      <sup>5</sup> And they who go down to the sea also (will be) saying, "May the fury of your waves swallow us also, O holy sea." <br>
      <sup>6</sup> And then all flesh of the Romans will lament. <br>
      <sup>7</sup> And while there will be temporary joy and exultation of the Jews, (there will be) affliction and oppression of the Romans from every necessity of the evil demons. <br>

      <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle"></p>

      <p>
      <sup>1</sup> And then three men will go forth and will condemn him (as) a liar and a deceiver. <br>
      <sup>2</sup> And these three men, two from heaven and one from the earth, also walk before the Antichrist and say - "Woe to you, O worker of injustice and inheritor of eternal fire." <br>
      <sup>3</sup> And they will walk in all the earth, crying out and saying to the afflicted Christians, "Hear O sons of men, and do not worship him, because he is not the Christ nor a  God-fearing man, but he is the Antichrist." <br>
      <sup>4</sup> And many Christians will run to the feet of the saints and say, "What shall we do, O saints? <br>
      <sup>5</sup> Where shall we Christians hide?" <br>
      <sup>6</sup> 'And many of the Christians will hide in mountains and caves and in the holes of the earth (and) will be saved, so that the treacherous Samuel' might not seize them. <br>
      <sup>7</sup> And when the Antichrist finds these three men he will kill them by the sword. <br>
      <sup>8</sup> Then that spoken by the prophet David will be fulfilled: "Then they will offer up bulls upon your altar" <br>
      <sup>9</sup> And with the Antichrist reigning and with the demons persecuting, the Jews contriving vanities against the Christians, the great day of the Lord draws near. <br>
      <sup>10</sup> And there will be judgment and recompense. And the deception of the devil will fall. <br>
      <sup>11</sup> And the light of the world, Christ our Lord and king of glory, will flower, to who is due all glory and honor and dominion forever. Amen. </p><br>
