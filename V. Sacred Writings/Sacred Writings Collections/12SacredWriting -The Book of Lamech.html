          <H2>Chapter 1</H2>




                    <p><sup>1</sup> [ The Book of the Testament of Lamech, the Father of Noah ]<br>
                      [ I, Lamech, the Son of Methuselah, the Son of Enoch who was the seventh from Adam,  write my testament about these events, in this book written in the days of Enoch. ]<br>
                      [ Noah and Abraham also add their testament to the latter part of this testament of Lamech. ]</p>

                    <p><sup>2</sup> [ My father's father, Enoch, was the son of Jared,<br> 
                      the son of Malaleel, the son of Cainan, <br>
                      the son of Enos, the son of Seth, <br>
                      the son of Adam and Eve who had lived in the garden of Eden. ]</p>

                    <p><sup>3</sup> [ I, Lamech, dwelt in the land of my father Methuselah, <br>
                      in the land of the valley of Shinar, in the land of Ur .   (south of Babylon) ] <br>
                      [ I was instructed by my father Methuselah to avoid the ways of violence, <br>
                      and to keep respect for God, the Most High, the Lord of Greatness, the Eternal King. </p>

                    <p><sup>4</sup> [ Some of the Holy Ones and the Watchers lived in the land, being natives of the land, <br>
                      guarding us and instructing us in the ways of truthfulness and peace. ] <br>
                      [ Their rivals, the Nephilim, (the Giants) were also natives in the land, and dwelt among us, stealing our wives and children with violence. ]<br> 
                      [ There were also foreigners (aliens) living among us in the land. ] </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>5</sup> [ I, Lamech, the father of Noah, was married to my wife, Bath-Enosh, in my [   ]th year.<br>   
                      She was the beautiful daughter of [   ], who was the son of [   ]. ] <br> 
                      [ In my [  ]th year my wife Bath-Enosh became pregnant with child. ]</p>
                    
                    <p><sup>6</sup> [ When I first observed my wife was with child, I rejoiced, <br>
                      yet I began to have some doubts for the reason of the expression on her face. ]<br>
                      Then I considered whether the pregnancy was due to the Watchers and Holy Ones, <br> 
                      or should be attributed to the Nephilim (the Giants), and I grew perturbed about this child. </p>

                    <p><sup>7</sup> Then I, Lamech, became afraid and went to Bath-Enosh, my w[ife … saying,<br> 
                      “Declare to me by the Most High, by the Lord of Greatness, by the Eternal King <br>
                      whether the child comes from the heavenly beings! </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>8</sup> Everything will you truthfully tell me,<br> 
                      whether [ the child is mine or not ] you will tell me without lies: <br>
                      Is this [ pregnancy of my seed?    Swear ] by the Eternal King!<br>  
                      Until you speak truthfully to me, and not with lies, [ I shall be upset (with you) ]” </p>

                    <p><sup>9</sup> Then Bath-Enosh my wife spoke with me forcefully, [ and she we]pt and said,<br> 
                      “O my brother and master, <br>
                      recall for yourself my pregnancy [ and our ] marital relations, and my breath within its sheath. <br>                     
                      Can I truthfully tell you everything?” [ when you are wrathful with me? ] </p>

                    <p><sup>10</sup> Then I was upset even more. <br>
                      When Bath-Enosh my wife noticed that my face had changed expression <br>
                      [ after she had become emotional, ]  then she gained control of her emotions and spoke with me. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>11</sup> She said to me, “O my master and [brother,  recall for yourself] my pregnancy.<br> 
                      I swear to you by the Great Holy One, by the Ruler of Heaven that this seed is yours,<br> 
                      that this pregnancy is from you, that from you is the planting of [ this ] fruit,<br>                      
                      [ that it is ] not from any alien, or from any of the Watchers, or from any heavenly being.</p>

                    <p><sup>12</sup> [ Why has the appearance] of your face changed like this upon you?<br> 
                      And why is it disfigured, and your spirit dejected like this? <br> 
                      [ For I ] tell you this truthfully.</p>

                    <p><sup>13</sup> Then I, Lamech, hurried to Methuselah, my father, and [ communicated ] all this to him <br>
                      [ so that he might consult Enoch ] his father, and come to know everything with certainty from him, <br>                         
                      since he is loved and fav[ored by God,<br> 
                      and with the Holy Ones] has his lot been apportioned,<br> 
                      and hence they (God and the angels) reveal everything to him.</p>

                    <p><sup>14</sup> When [ my father ] Methuselah heard these things, he hurried to Enoch, his father,<br> 
                      to learn from him the truth of the whole matter [ and to gain from Enoch ] his approval, <br>
                      and he (Enoch) had previously gone to Parvayyim.</p>

                    <p><sup>15</sup> There he found Enoch his father, and he said to Enoch, his father,<br> 
                      “O my father and master, I have come to you [ for guidance and blessing ]<br> 
                      and I say to you to not be angry with me <br>
                      because I have come here to you [ with true ] respect for you, [ my father ]”</p>

                    <p><sup>16</sup> [ Enoch replied to his son, Methuselah, my father,<br> 
                      “My son, the pregnancy of the wife of your son Lamech is blessed by God, the Lord of Heaven.<br>                       
                      And the child will be the father of many people who will be blessed forever,]<br> 
                      and not for length [ of days. ]</p> 
                        
                    <p><sup>17</sup> For during the days of Yared, my father,<br>  
                      [ God blessed all his ] sons [ with a great blessing for all eternity.] <br>                        
                      And to you they will be [ many people ] upon the whole of the Earth <br> 
                      [ from the river valley of ] my land, to this sea [ across the face of the ] Earth,<br>  
                      [ to the ends of the ] Earth [ they will habitate the land. ] </p>
                                          
                    <p><sup>18</sup> And now, go [ and live your life ] truthfully, not with lies [ or robbery,<br>  
                      and thus be the blessed sons of God. ] <br>                        
                      [ For when ] He divided all the Earth <br> 
                      [ he gave it to His obedient sons for an inheritance and a blessing,<br>  
                      whereas He did not give the blessing of inheritance to His rebellious sons. ]</p>
                        
                    <p><sup>19</sup> [ Thus was the case in the beginning, at the Garden of Eden, <br>
                      when Adam and Eve were sent forth from paradise for disobedience.<br>                         
                      And yet again at the fall of the Tower of Babel,<br> 
                      were the rebellious sons punished instead of receiving the blessing of the our Lord's inheritance. ]</p>
                          
                    <p><sup>20</sup> [ The Lord our God, He blessed the sons of obedience for their faithfulness ]<br> 
                      and for their labor [ in the fields of the Earth, which is His garden. ]<br>
                      [ To them the Lord God has given his blessing for all eternity, <br>
                      for their faithfulness and obedience to Him and His angels,<br> 
                      the Watchers and the Holy Ones (or, Holy Men). ]</p>

                    <p><sup>21</sup> [ Yet the rebellious sons, they have been cursed and disinherited for all eternity<br> 
                      because of their great disobedience of iniquity and bloodshed over that face of the Earth.<br>
                      From [ morning to nght ] they will rage <br>
                      and [ weep many tears ] for all eternity [ for their ] evil [deeds,<br>
                      [ for God has taken their inheritance and He has divided it and has given it to others,<br>  
                      because of their great sins across the face of all the Earth. ]</p>  

                    <p><sup>22</sup> [ The wickedness of iniquity and cruel bloodshed has multiplied on Earth, <br>
                      and God has judged the rebellious sons as deserving of a cursing instead of His blessing, <br>
                      even though they are the elder sons. ]</p> 
                      
                    <p><sup>23</sup> [ I, Enoch, was present at the time of the judgments of the Watchers and Holy Ones, ]<br> 
                      [ And ] I beheld the judicial sentence [ against the sins that were ] great, and the end [ of peace upon the ] surface of the Earth.</p>
                      
                    <p><sup>24</sup> [ The judgment is that the blessing (of God) has been taken away from them that rebelled,<br>
                      and the curse (of God) is ] upon them<br> 
                      [ because they rebelled against His watchers and Holy Ones,<br> 
                      and cursed the name of God and multiplied iniquity and bloodshed. ]</p>
                      
                    <p><sup>25</sup> [ The judgment is that those sons that have been faithful to God and man, <br>
                      and who shall be blessed instead of their elder brethen. ]<br>                     
                      [ The judgment is,<br> 
                      that the faihful sons of God will have the inheritance of their rebellious brethren given to them,<br> 
                      for their righteousness, and obedient service to the Watchers and the Holy Ones. ]</p>
                      
                    <p><sup>26</sup> [ And Enoch, my father's father said to my father,<br> 
                      Methuselah, thee and thy brethren are among the blessed sons of God.<br>                        
                      Thus your son Lamech is blessed, and his son will be blessed, <br>
                      despite the doubt your son has concerning his wife's pregnancy. ]</p>
                      
                    <p><sup>27</sup> [ And then Enoch said to Methuselah,<br>  
                      'I am getting older, and I have already given you and your son my blessing.<br>                        
                      Thus I wish to give my blessing now to the son of your son, Lamech, also,<br> 
                      for Lamech has been a faithful and obedient son of God and his angels. ]</p>
                      
                    <p><sup>28</sup> [ And Enoch blessed his great grandson in the name of the Lord  our God, ] <br>
                      and he wrote [ a book to record these events in the name of Lamech,<br> 
                      saying to Methuselah,<br> 
                      To your son Lamech, I entrust this book of records.] <br>
                      And to you, Methuselah my son, [ I entrust ] this child.</p> 

                    <p><sup>29</sup> Behold, when I Enoch [ was a child, <br>
                      I was entrusted by my father to heavenly beings, the Watchers and the Holy Ones, ]<br>                       
                      And not from the heavenly beings,<br> 
                      but rather from Lamech your son [ shall your son's son be blessed and raised. ]</p> 
                      
                    <p><sup>30</sup> And he is unlike [ the sons of other men on Earth ]<br> 
                      Instead [ he is like one of the heavenly beings. ] <br>                     
                      Lamech your son feared his appearance [ at pregnancy, <br>
                      yet he should  …] truthfully believe <br>
                      that [ God will bless Him and His son, for his faithfullness and obedience. ] </p>
                      
                    <p><sup>31</sup> And now I say to you, my son, and I declare to you<br>
                      [ that I speak to you ] truthfully [ and I do not deceive you with lies. ] <br>                      
                      Go, speak to Lamech your son [ about these things, and his blessing before God, <br>
                      who has blessed him ] and placed him ] on the Earth, <br>
                      and every deed of the heavenly beings [ will bless him. ]</p>
                      
                    <p><sup>32</sup> [ And  ] he lifted his face, and his eyes shone like the s[un of Heaven]<br>  
                      [Yes,] this child, [ the light ] and [ peace of Heaven will precede him,<br>  
                      while the judgment of God precedes against the Nephilim and the people of the Earth,</p>

                    <p><sup>33</sup> Behold then, they were confused and [ afraid of Heaven, <br> 
                      For, to the ] eternal [ God ] they give [ not their thanks and praise, ]<br>
                      And ] they will commit many deeds of violence until [ the day of punishment, ] <br>
                      and [ they shall increase ] , and all the paths [ of mankind will be defiled by robberies. ] </p> 
                      
                    <p><sup>34</sup> And now I shall declare to you the mystery [ of the judgment of the world ]<br> 
                      and to Lamech] your son declare this mystery,<br>                     
                      [… …for ] during his days, <br>
                      [all] the deed[s] [ of the Nephilim will be punished by God. ] <br>                      
                      Praised be the Lord of all [ spirits and all creation. ]  </p>
                      
                    <p><sup>35</sup> And when Methuselah heard [ why his nieghbors were cursed, he trembled  ]<br> 
                      and with Lamech his son, he spoke privately [ about the words of Enoch, his father. ]<br>                      
                      And when I, Lamech, [ declared to my son Noah the judgments of Heaven,]<br> 
                      he declared that he issued from me [ and with the blessing of God. ] </p>

<!-------------------------------NOTES ABOUT THE BOOK ------------------------------->

 <!------
The 'Genesis Apocryphon'

From Cave 1 of the Dead Sea Scrolls library at the 'Essene Academy' at Quumran, Israel.

The scroll is a book of substantial size, quite plausibly the Book of Lamech, an early document that repeats some the story of the Book of Giants, the Book of Noah, and the first years of the life of Abram, ending with Abram in Egypt with Sarai.  Therefore, the King of Egypt could possibly have had a hand in the construction of the book of Lamech, a second generation of the well known book of Giants, because the Coptics priests that lodged near the pyramids were known to write books.

The Book of Lamech is apparently a source for and a first version of the Book of Genesis, literally the old testament of Lamech and Noah (and then Abram) which was set forth in the Book of Giants.  The Book of Lamech sometimes records events allegorically at times, much like the Book of Genesis. 



Apparently written by Melchizedek, the King of Salem [Genesis 14:18], the only known copy of the Book of Lamech was found buried in the archives of the Essene monastary at Quumran. 

Written using nineteen long columns on four large pieces of leather,about half of the book is missing due to corruption,thus the document starts with educated estimates of the real text. 

Some columns have more words than others because the script was written in a smaller print and some pages were left with spaces to help aid the flow of the text. Word arrangments and line spacing are approximated, and are not to scale in the first ediion of vol 1.



Again, instead of using the 'larger paragraphs of the Numerology' format of scriptures, this edition attempts to utilize the two-by-two 'Levitcal' arrangments for the text. 



Editorial Marks

[ Xyz ]  encloses either conjectural restorations of the first translators' guesswork,  or illegible damage.


[ Xyz ]  written in Italics [with brackets] indicates either words added by the present translator to enhance clarification, or the original guesswork of the author-translator.  [ These segments are indended for the review and approval of the research community of Biblical archeology. ]


< Xyz >  enclose notes regarding large pieces of the missing text. 


Xyz    written in Italics, without brackets, are words of preceding translators, not present in the text, utilized to improve the English sense, or they are educated estimations of text already established by other translators.  Such notes are tpyically open to some discussion.


_Space_   signals blank spacing deliberately left vacated by the scribe (not quite to scale)
