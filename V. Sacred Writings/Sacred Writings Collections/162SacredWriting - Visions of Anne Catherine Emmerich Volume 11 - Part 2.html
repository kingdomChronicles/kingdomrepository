<p class="chapterTitle">The bitter Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ</p>

 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">MEDITATION VI - The Last Pasch.</p>
                               
 Jesus and his disciples ate the Paschal Lamb in the supper-room. They divided into three
 groups. Jesus ate the Paschal Lamb with the twelve Apostles in the supper-room, properly
 so called; Nathaniel with twelve other disciples in one of the lateral rooms, and Eliacim (the
 son of Cleophas and Mary, the daughter of Heli), who had been a disciple of John the
 Baptist, with twelve more, in another side-room.
 Three lambs were immolated for them in the Temple, but there was a fourth lamb which
 was immolated in the supper-room, and was the one eaten by Jesus with his Apostles. Judas
 was not aware of this circumstance, because being engaged in plotting his betrayal of our
 Lord, he only returned a few moments before the repast, and after the immolation of the
 lamb had taken place. Most touching was the scene of the immolation of the lamb to be
 eaten by Jesus and his Apostles; it took place in the vestibule of the supper-room. The
 Apostles and disciples were present, singing the 118th Psalm. Jesus spoke of a new period
 then beginning, and said that the sacrifice of Moses and the figure of the Paschal Lamb were
 about to receive their accomplishment, but that on this very account, the lamb was to be
 immolated in the same manner as formerly in Egypt, and that they were really about to go
 forth from the house of bondage.
 The vessels and necessary instruments were prepared, and then the attendants brought a
 beautiful little lamb, decorated with a crown, which was sent to the Blessed Virgin in the
 room where she had remained with the other holy women. The lamb was fastened with its
 back against a board by a cord around its body, and reminded me of Jesus tied to the pillar
 and scourged. The son of Simeon held the lamb’s head; Jesus made a slight incision in its
 neck with the point of a knife, which he then gave to the son of Simeon, that he might
 complete killing it. Jesus appeared to inflict the wound with a feeling of repugnance, and he
 was quick in his movements, although his countenance was grave, and his manner such as
 to inspire respect. The blood flowed into a basin, and the attendants brought a branch of
 hyssop, which Jesus dipped in it. Then he went to the door of the room, stained the sideposts
 and the lock with blood, and placed the branch which had been dipped in blood above
 the door. He then spoke to the disciples, and told them, among other things, that the
 exterminating angel would pass by, that they would adore in that room without fear or
 anxiety, when he, the true Paschal Lamb, should have been immolated—that a new epoch
 and a new sacrifice were about to begin, which would last to the end of the world.
 They then went to the other side of the room, near the hearth where the Ark of the
 Covenant had formerly stood. Fire had already been lighted there, and Jesus poured some
 blood upon the hearth, consecrating it as an altar; and the remainder of the blood and the fat
 were thrown on the fire beneath the altar, after which Jesus, followed by his Apostles,
 walked round the supper-room, singing some psalms, and consecrating it as a new Temple.
 The doors were all closed during this time. Meanwhile the son of Simeon had completed the
 preparation of the lamb. He passed a stake through its body, fastening the front legs on a
 cross piece of wood; and stretching the hind ones along the stake. It bore a strong
 resemblance to Jesus on the cross, and was placed in the oven, to be there roasted with the
 three other lambs brought from the Temple.
 The Paschal Lambs of the Jews were all immolated in the vestibule of the Temple, but in
 different parts, according as the persons who were to eat them were rich, or poor, or
 strangers.1 The Paschal Lamb belonging to Jesus was not immolated in the Temple, but
 everything else was done strictly according to the law. Jesus again addressed his disciples,
 saying that the lamb was but a figure, that he himself would next day be the true Paschal
 Lamb, together with other things which I have forgotten.
 When Jesus had finished his instructions concerning the Paschal Lamb and its
 signification, the time being come, and Judas also returned, the tables were set out. The
 disciples put on travelling dresses which were in the vestibule, different shoes, a white robe
 resembling a shirt, and a cloak, which was short in front and longer behind, their sleeves
 were large and turned back, and they girded up their clothes around the waist. Each party
 went to their own table; and two sets of disciples in the side rooms, and our Lord and his
 Apostles in the supper-room. They held staves in their hands, and went two and two to the
 1 She here again explained the manner in which the families assembled together, and in what numbers. But the
 writer has forgotten her words.
 table, where they remained standing, each in his own place, with the stave resting on his
 arms, and his hands upraised.
 The table was narrow, and about half a foot higher than the knees of a man; in shape it
 resembled a horseshoe, and opposite Jesus, in the inner part of the half-circle, there was a
 space left vacant, that the attendants might be able to set down the dishes. As far as I can
 remember, John, James the Greater, and James the Less sat on the right-hand of Jesus; after
 them Bartholomew, and then, round the corner, Thomas and Judas Iscariot. Peter, Andrew,
 and Thaddeus sat on the left of Jesus; next came Simon, and then (round the corner)
 Matthew and Philip.
 The Paschal Lamb was placed on a dish in the centre of the table. Its head rested on its
 front legs, which were fastened to a cross-stick, its hind legs being stretched out, and the dish
 was garnished with garlic. By the side there was a dish with the Paschal roast meat, then
 came a plate with green vegetables balanced against each other, and another plate with
 small bundles of bitter herbs, which had the appearance of aromatic herbs. Opposite Jesus
 there was also one dish with different herbs, and a second containing a brown-coloured
 sauce of beverage. The guest had before them some round loaves instead of plates, and they
 used ivory knives.
 After the prayer, the major-domo laid the knife for cutting the lamb on the table before
 Jesus, who placed a cup of wine before him, and filled six other cups, each one of which
 stood between two Apostles. Jesus blessed the wine and drank, and the Apostles drank two
 together out of one cup. Then our Lord proceeded to cut up the lamb; his Apostles
 presented their pieces of bread in turn, and each received his share. They ate it in haste,
 separating the flesh from the bone, by means of their ivory knives, and the bones were
 afterwards burnt. They also ate the garlic and green herbs in haste, dipping them in the
 sauce. All this time they remained standing, only leaning slightly on the backs of their seats.
 Jesus brake one of the loaves of unleavened bread, covered up a part of it, and divided the
 remainder among his Apostles. Another cup of wine was brought, but Jesus drank not of it:
 ‘Take this,’ he said, ‘and divide it among you, for I will not drink from henceforth of the fruit of
 the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father’ (Matt.
 26:29). When they had drunk the wine, they sang a hymn; then Jesus prayed or taught, and
 they again washed their hands. After this they sat down.
 Our Lord cut up another lamb which was carried to the holy women in one of the
 buildings of the court, where they were seated at table. The Apostles ate some more
 vegetables and lettuce. The countenance of our Divine Saviour bore an indescribable
 expression of serenity and recollection, greater than I had ever before seen. He bade the
 Apostles forget all their cares. The Blessed Virgin also, as she sat at table with the other
 women, looked most placid and calm. When the other women came up, and took hold of
 her veil to make her turn round and speak to them, her every movement expressed the
 sweetest self-control and placidity of spirit.
 At first Jesus conversed lovingly and calmly with his disciples, but after a while he
 became grave and sad: ‘Amen, amen, I say to you, that one of you is about to betray me:’ he said,
 he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish’ (Matt. 26:21.23). Jesus was then distributing the
 lettuce, of which there was only one dish, to those Apostles who were by his side, and he
 had given Judas, who was nearly opposite to him, the office of distributing it to the others.
 When Jesus spoke of a traitor, an expression which filled all the Apostles with fear, he said:
 ‘he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish,’ which means: ‘one of the twelve who are eating
 and drinking with me—one of those with whom I am eating bread.’ He did not plainly point
 out Judas to the others by these words; for to dip the hand in the same dish was an expression
 used to signify the most friendly and intimate intercourse. He was desirous, however, to
 give a warning to Judas, who was then really dipping his hand in the dish with our Saviour,
 to distribute the lettuce. Jesus continued to speak: ‘The Son of Man indeed goeth,’ he said, ‘as it
 is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man shall be betrayed: It were better for
 him if that man had not been born.’
 The Apostles were very much troubled, and each one of them exclaimed: ‘Lord, is it I?’ for
 they were all perfectly aware that they did not entirely understand his words. Peter leaned
 towards John, behind Jesus, and made him a sign to ask our Lord who the traitor was to be,
 for, having so often been reproved by our Lord, he trembled lest it should be himself who
 was referred to. John was seated at the right hand of Jesus, and as all were leaning on their
 left arms, using the right to eat, his head was close to the bosom of Jesus. He leaned then on
 his breast and said: ‘Lord, who is it?’ I did not see Jesus say to him with his lips: ‘He it is to
 whom I shall reach bread dipped.’ I do not know whether he whispered it to him, but John
 knew it, when Jesus having dipped the bread, which was covered with lettuce, gave it
 tenderly to Judas, who also asked: ‘Is it I, Lord?’ Jesus looked at him with love, and
 answered him in general terms. Among the Jews, to give bread dipped was a mark of
 friendship and confidence; Jesus on this occasion gave Judas the morsel, in order thus to
 warn him, without making known his guilt to the others. But the heart of Judas burned with
 anger, and during the whole time of the repast, I saw a frightful little figure seated at his feet,
 and sometimes ascending to his heart. I did not see John repeat to Peter what he had
 learned from Jesus, but he set his fears at rest by a look.
 
 
 
 

 <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">MEDITATION VII - The Washing of the Feet.</p>

 They arose from table, and whilst they were arranging their clothes, as they usually did
 before making their solemn prayer, the major-domo came in with two servants to take away
 the table. Jesus, standing in the midst of his Apostles, spoke to them long, in a most solemn
 manner. I could not repeat exactly his whole discourse, but I remember he spoke of his
 kingdom, of his going to his Father, of what he would leave them now that he was about to
 be taken away, etc. He also gave them some instructions concerning penance, the
 confession of sin, repentance, and justification.
 I felt that these instructions referred to the washing of the feet, and I saw that all the
 Apostles acknowledged their sins and repented of them, with the exception of Judas. This
 discourse was long and solemn. When it was concluded, Jesus sent John and James the
 Less to fetch water from the vestibule, and he told the Apostles to arrange the seats in a half
 circle. He went himself into the vestibule, where he girded himself with a towel. During this
 time, the Apostles spoke among themselves, and began speculating as to which of them
 would be the greatest, for our Lord having expressly announced that he was about to leave
 them and that his kingdom was near at hand, they felt strengthened anew in their idea that
 he had secret plans, and that he was referring to some earthly triumph which would be
 theirs at the last moment.
 Meanwhile Jesus, in the vestibule, told John to take a basin, and James a pitcher filled
 with water, with which they followed him into the room, where the major-domo had placed
 another empty basin.
 Jesus, on returning to his disciples in so humble a manner, addressed them a few words
 of reproach on the subject of the dispute which had arisen between them, and said among
 other things, that he himself was their servant, and that they were to sit down, for him to
 wash their feet. They sat down, therefore, in the same order as they had sat at table. Jesus
 went from one to the other, poured water from the basin which John carried on the feet of
 each, and then, taking the end of the towel wherewith he was girded, wiped them. Most
 loving and tender was the manner of our Lord while thus humbling himself at the feet of his
 Apostles.
 Peter, when his turn came, endeavoured through humility to prevent Jesus from washing
 his feet: ‘Lord,’ he exclaimed, ‘dost thou wash my feet?’ Jesus answered: ‘What I do, thou
 knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.’ It appeared to me that he said to him privately:
 ‘Simon, thou hast merited for my Father to reveal to thee who I am, whence I come, and
 whither I am going, thou alone hast expressly confessed it, therefore upon thee will I build
 my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. My power will remain with thy
 successors to the end of the world.’
 Jesus showed him to the other Apostles, and said, that when he should be no more
 present among them, Peter was to fill his place in their regard. Peter said: ‘Thou shalt never
 wash my feet!’ Our Lord replied: ‘If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me.’ Then Peter
 exclaimed: ‘Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.’ Jesus replied: ‘He that is
 washed, needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all.’
 By these last words he referred to Judas. He had spoken of the washing of the feet as
 signifying purification from daily faults, because the feet, which are continually in contact
 with the earth, are also continually liable to be soiled, unless great care is taken.
 This washing of the feet was spiritual, and served as a species of absolution. Peter, in his
 zeal, saw nothing in it but too great an act of abasement on the part of his Master; he knew
 not that to save him Jesus would the very next day humble himself even to the ignominious
 death of the cross.
 When Jesus washed the feet of Judas, it was in the most loving and affecting manner; he
 bent his sacred face even on to the feet of the traitor; and in a low voice bade him now at
 least enter into himself, for that he had been a faithless traitor for the last year. Judas
 appeared to be anxious to pay no heed whatever to his words, and spoke to John, upon
 which Peter became angry, and exclaimed: ‘Judas, the Master speaks to thee!’ Then Judas
 made our Lord some vague, evasive reply, such as, ‘Heaven forbid, Lord!’ The others had
 not remarked that Jesus was speaking to Judas, for this words were uttered in a low voice, in
 order not to be heard by them, and besides, they were engaged in putting on their shoes.
 Nothing in the whole course of the Passion grieved Jesus so deeply as the treason of Judas.
 Jesus finally washed the feet of John and James.
 He then spoke again on the subject of humility, telling them that he that was the greatest
 among them was to be as their servant, and that henceforth they were to wash one another’s
 feet. Then he put on his garments, and the Apostles let down their clothes, which they had
 girded up before eating the Paschal Lamb.
 
 <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">MEDITATION VIII - Institution of the Holy Eucharist.</p>

 By command of our Lord, the major-domo had again laid out the table, which he had
 raised a little; then, having placed it once more in the middle of the room, he stood one urn
 filled with wine, and another with water underneath it. Peter and John went into the part of
 the room near the hearth, to get the chalice which they had brought from Seraphia’s house,
 and which was still wrapped up in its covering. They carried it between them as if they had
 been carrying a tabernacle, and placed it on the table before Jesus. An oval plate stood there,
 with three fine white azymous loaves, placed on a piece of linen, by the side of the half loaf
 which Jesus had set aside during the Paschal meal, also a jar containing wine and water,
 and three boxes, one filled with thick oil, a second with liquid oil, and the third empty.
 In earlier times, it had been the practice for all at table to eat of the same loaf and drink of
 the same cup at the end of the meal, thereby to express their friendship and brotherly love,
 and to welcome and bid farewell to each other. I think Scripture must contain something
 upon this subject.
 On the day of the Last Supper, Jesus raised this custom (which had hitherto been no
 more than a symbolical and figurative rite) to the dignity of the holiest of sacraments. One
 of the charges brought before Caiphas, on occasion of the treason of Judas, was, that Jesus
 had introduced a novelty into the Paschal ceremonies, but Nicodemus proved from
 Scripture that it was an ancient practice.
 Jesus was seated between Peter and John, the doors were closed, and everything was
 done in the most mysterious and imposing manner. When the chalice was taken out of its
 covering, Jesus prayed, and spoke to his Apostles with the utmost solemnity. I saw him
 giving them an explanation of the Supper, and of the entire ceremony, and I was forcibly
 reminded of a priest teaching others to say Mass.
 He then drew a species of shelf with grooves from the boars on which the jars stood, and
 taking a piece of white linen with which the chalice was covered, spread it over the board
 and shelf. I then saw him lift a round plate, which he placed on this same shelf, off the top
 of the chalice. He next took the azymous loaves from beneath the linen with which they
 were covered and placed them before him on the board; then he took out of the chalice a
 smaller vase, and ranged the six little glasses on each side of it. Then he blessed the bread
 and also the oil, to the best of my belief after which he lifted up the paten with the loaves
 upon it, in his two hands, raised his eyes, prayed, offered, and replaced the paten on the
 table, covering it up again. He then took the chalice, had some wine poured into it by Peter,
 and some water, which he first blessed, by John, adding to it a little more water, which he
 poured into a small spoon, and after this he blessed the chalice, raised it up with a prayer,
 made the oblation, and replaced it on the table.
 John and Peter poured some water on his hands, which he held over the plate on which
 the azymous loaves had been placed; then he took a little of the water which had been
 poured on his hands, in the spoon that he had taken out of the lower part of the chalice, and
 poured it on theirs. After this, the vase was passed round the table, and all the Apostles
 washed their hands in it. I do not remember whether this was the precise order in which
 these ceremonies were performed; all I know is, that they reminded me in a striking manner
 of the holy sacrifice of the Mass.
 Meanwhile, our Divine Lord became more and more tender and loving in his
 demeanour; he told his Apostles that he was about to give them all that he had, namely, his
 entire self, and he looked as though perfectly transformed by love. I saw him becoming
 transparent, until he resembled a luminous shadow. He broke the bread into several pieces,
 which he laid together on the paten, and then took a corner of the first piece and dripped it
 into the chalice. At he moment when he was doing this, I seemed to see the Blessed Virgin
 receiving the Holy Sacrament in a spiritual manner, although she was not present in the
 supper-room. I do not know how it was done, but I thought I saw her enter without
 touching the ground, and come before our Lord to receive the Holy Eucharist; after which I
 saw her no more. Jesus had told her in the morning, at Bethania, that he would keep the
 Pasch with her spiritually, and he had named the hour at which she was to betake herself to
 prayer, in order to receive it in spirit.
 Again he prayed and taught; his words came forth from his lips like fire and light, and
 entered into each of the Apostles, with the exception of Judas. He took the paten with the
 pieces of bread (I do not know whether he had placed it on the chalice) and said: ‘Take and
 eat; this is my Body which is given for you.’ He stretched forth his right hand as if to bless, and,
 whilst he did so, a brilliant light came from him, his words were luminous, the bread
 entered the mouths of the Apostles as a brilliant substance, and light seemed to penetrate
 and surround them all, Judas alone remaining dark. Jesus presented the bread first to Peter,
 next to John and then he made a sign to Judas to approach.2 Judas was thus the third who
 received the Adorable Sacrament, but the words of our Lord appeared to turn aside from the
 mouth of the traitor, and come back to their Divine Author. So perturbed was I in spirit at
 this sight, that my feelings cannot be described. Jesus said to him: ‘That which thou dost, do
 quickly.’ He then administered the Blessed Sacrament to the other Apostles, who approached
 two and two.
 Jesus raised the chalice by its two handles to a level with his face, and pronounced the
 words of consecration. Whilst doing so, he appeared wholly transfigured, as it were
 transparent, and as though entirely passing into what he was going to give his Apostles. He
 made Peter and John drink from the chalice which he held in his hand, and then placed it
 again on the table. John poured the Divine Blood from the chalice into the smaller glasses,
 and Peter presented them to the Apostles, two of whom drank together out of the same cup.
 I think, but am not quite certain, that Judas also partook of the chalice; he did not return to

 had seen John the last to receive.
 his place, but immediately left the supper-room, and the other Apostles thought that Jesus
 had given him some commission to do. He left without praying or making any
 thanksgiving, and hence you may perceive how sinful it is to neglect returning thanks either
 after receiving our daily food, or after partaking of the Life-Giving Bread of Angels. During
 the entire meal, I had seen a frightful little figure, with one foot like a dried bone, remaining
 close to Judas, but when he had reached the door, I beheld three devils pressing round him;
 one entered into his mouth, the second urged him on, and the third preceded him. It was
 night, and they seemed to be lighting him, whilst he hurried onward like a madman.
 Our Lord poured a few drops of the Precious Blood remaining in the chalice into the
 little vase of which I have already spoken, and then placed his fingers over the chalice, while
 Peter and John poured water and wine upon them. This done, he caused them to drink
 again from the chalice, and what remained of its contents was poured into the smaller
 glasses, and distributed to the other Apostles. Then Jesus wiped the chalice, put into it the
 little vase containing the remainder of the Divine Blood, and placed over it the paten with
 the fragments of the consecrated bread, after which he again put on the cover, wrapped up
 the chalice, and stood it in he midst of the six small cups. I saw the Apostles receive in
 communion these remains of the Adorable Sacrament, after the Resurrection.
 I do not remember seeing our Lord himself eat and drink of the consecrated elements,
 neither did I see Melchisedech, when offering the bread and wine, taste of them himself. It
 was made known to me why priests partake of them, although Jesus did not.
 Here Sister Emmerich looked suddenly up, and appeared to be listening. Some
 explanation was given her on this subject, but the following words were all that she could
 repeat to us: ‘If the office of distributing it had been given to angels, they would not have
 partaken, but if priests did not partake, the Blessed Eucharist would be lost—it is through
 their participation that it is preserved.’
 There was an indescribable solemnity and order in all the actions of Jesus during the
 institution of the Holy Eucharist, and his every movement was most majestic. I saw the
 Apostles noting things down in the little rolls of parchment which they carried on their
 persons. Several times during the ceremonies I remarked that they bowed to each other, in
 the same way that our priests do.
 
 


<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">MEDITATION IX - Private Instruction and Consecrations.</p>

Jesus gave his Apostles some private instructions; he told them how they were to
preserve the Blessed Sacrament in memory of him, even to the end of the world; he taught
them the necessary forms for making use of and communicating it, and in what manner
they were, by degrees, to teach and publish this mystery; finally he told them when they
were to receive what remained of the consecrated Elements, when to give some to the
Blessed Virgin, and how to consecrate, themselves, after he should have sent them the
Divine Comforter. He then spoke concerning the priesthood, the sacred unction, and the
preparation of the Chrism and Holy Oils.3 He had there three boxes, two of which
contained a mixture of oil and balm. He taught them how to make this mixture, what parts
of the body were to be anointed with them, and upon what occasions. I remember, among
other things, that he mentioned a case in which the Holy Eucharist could not be
administered; perhaps what he said had reference to Extreme Unction, for my recollections
on this point are not very clear. He spoke of different kinds of anointing, and in particular of
that of kings, and he said that even wicked kings who were anointed, derived from it
especial powers. He put ointment and oil in the empty box, and mixed them together, but I
cannot say for certain whether it was at this moment, or at the time of the consecration of
the bread, that he blessed the oil.
I then saw Jesus anoint Peter and John, on whose hands he had already poured the water
which had flowed on his own, and two whom he had given to drink out of the chalice. Then
he laid his hands on their shoulders and heads, while they, on their part, joined their hands
and crossed their thumbs, bowing down profoundly before him—I am not sure whether
they did not even kneel. He anointed the thumb and fore-finger of each of their hands, and
marked a cross on their heads with Chrism. He said also that this would remain with them
unto the end of the world.
James the Less, Andrew, James the Greater, and Bartholomew, were also consecrated. I
saw likewise that on Peter’s bosom he crossed a sort of stole worn round the neck, whilst on
the others he simply placed it crosswise, from the right shoulder to the left side. I do not
know whether this was done at the time of the institution of the Blessed Sacrament, or only
for the anointing.
I understood that Jesus communicated to them by this unction something essential and
supernatural, beyond my power to describe. He told them that when they should have
received the Holy Spirit they were to consecrate the bread and wine, and anoint the other
Apostles. It was made known to me then that, on the day of Pentecost, Peter and John
imposed their hands upon the other Apostles, and a week later upon several of the disciples.
After the Resurrection, John gave the Adorable Sacrament for the first time to the Blessed
Virgin. It is a festival no longer kept in the Church on earth, but I see it celebrated in the
Church triumphant. For the first few days after Pentecost I saw only Peter and John
consecrate the Blessed Eucharist, but after that the others also consecrated.
Our Lord next proceeded to bless fire in a brass vessel, and care was taken that it should
not go out, but it was kept near the spot where the Blessed Sacrament gad been deposited, in
one division of the ancient Paschal hearth, and fire was always taken from it when needed
for spiritual purposes.
3 It was not without surprise that the editor, some years after these things had been related by Sister Emmerich,
read, in the Latin edition of the Roman Catechism (Mayence, Muller), in reference to the Sacrament of
Confirmation, that, according to the tradition of the holy pope Fabian, Jesus taught his Apostles in what
manner they were to prepare the Holy Chrism, after the institution of the Blessed Sacrament. The Pope says
expressly, in the 54th paragraph of his Second Epistle to the Bishops of the East: ‘Our predecessors received
from the Apostles and delivered to us that our Saviour Jesus Christ, after having made the Last Supper with
his Apostles and washed their feet, taught them how to prepare the Holy Chrism.’
All that Jesus did upon this occasion was done in private, and taught equally in private.
The Church has retained all that was essential of these secret instructions, and, under the
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, developed and adapted them to all her requirements.
Whether Peter and John were both consecrated bishops, or Peter alone as bishop and
John as priest, or to what dignity the other four Apostles were raised, I cannot pretend to
say. But the different ways in which our Lord arranged the Apostles’ stoles appear to
indicate different degrees of consecration.
When these holy ceremonies were concluded, the chalice (near which the blessed Chrism
also stood) was re-covered, and the Adorable Sacrament carried by Peter and John into the
back part of the room, which was divided off by a curtain, and from thenceforth became the
Sanctuary. The spot where the Blessed Sacrament was deposited was not very far above the
Paschal stove. Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus took care of the Sanctuary and of the
supper-room during the absence of the Apostles.
Jesus again instructed his Apostles for a considerable length of time, and also prayed
several times. He frequently appeared to be conversing with his Heavenly Father, and to be
overflowing with enthusiasm and love. The Apostles also were full of joy and zeal, and
asked him various questions which he forthwith answered. The scriptures must contain
much of this last discourse and conversation. He told Peter and John different things to be
made known later to the other Apostles, who in their turn were to communicate them to the
disciples and holy women, according to the capacity of each for such knowledge. He had a
private conversation with John, whom he told that his life would be longer than the lives of
the others. He spoke to him also concerning seven Churches, some crowns and angels, and
instructed him in the meaning of certain mysterious figures, which signified, to the best of
my belief, different epochs. The other Apostles were slightly jealous of this confidential
communication being made to John.
Jesus spoke also of the traitor. ‘Now he is doing this or that,’ he said, and I, in fact, saw
Judas doing exactly as he said of him. As Peter was vehemently protesting that he would
always remain faithful, our Lord said to him: ‘Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have
you that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not: and thou being
once converted, confirm thy brethren.’
Again, our Lord, said, that whither he was going they could not follow him, when Peter
exclaimed: ‘Lord, I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death.’ And Jesus replied:
‘Amen, amen, I say to thee, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.’
Jesus, while making known to his Apostles that trying times were at hand for them, said:
‘When I sent you without purse, or scrip, or shoes, did you want anything?’ They answered:
‘Nothing.’ ‘But now,’ he continued, ‘he that hath a purse let him take it, and likewise a scrip, and he
that hath not, let him sell his coat and buy a sword. For I say to you, that this that is written must yet
be fulfilled in me: AND WITH THE WICKED WAS HE RECKONED. For the things
concerning me have an end.’ The Apostles only understood his words in a carnal sense, and
Peter showed him two swords, which were short and thick, like cleavers. Jesus said: ‘It is
enough: let us go hence.’ Then they sang the thanksgiving hymn, put the table on one side,
and went into the vestibule.
There, Jesus found his Mother, Mary of Cleophas, and Magdalen, who earnestly
besought him not to go to Mount Olivet, for a report has spread that his enemies were
seeking to lay hands on him. But Jesus comforted them in few words, and hastened
onward—it being then about nine o’clock. They went down the road by which Peter and
John had come to the supper-room, and directed their steps towards Mount Olivet.
I have always seen the Pasch and the institution of the Blessed Sacrament take place in
the order related above. But my feelings were each time so strongly excited and my emotion
so great, that I could not give much attention to all the details, but now I have seen them
more distinctly. No words can describe how painful and exhausting is such a sight as that of
beholding the hidden recesses of hearts, the love and constancy of our Saviour, and to know
at the same time all that is going to befall him. How would it be possible to observe all that
is merely external! The heart is overflowing with admiration, gratitude, and love—the
blindness of men seems perfectly incomprehensible—and the soul is overwhelmed with
sorrow at the thought of the ingratitude of the whole world, and of her own sins!
The eating of the Paschal Lamb was performed by Jesus rapidly, and in entire conformity
with all the legal ordinances. The Pharisees were in the habit of adding some minute and
superstitious ceremonies.
