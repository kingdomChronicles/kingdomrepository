 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">Genealogy, Birth, and Marriage of St. Anne</p>
                               

 
 <p>
<sup>1</sup> The ancestors of St. Anne were Essenians. <br>
<sup>2</sup> These extraordinarily pious people were descended from those priests who, in the time of Moses and Aaron, carried the Ark, and who received precise rules in the days of Isaias and Jeremias. <br>
<sup>3</sup> They were not numerous in the beginning. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Later on in Palestine they lived in communities occupying a tract about forty-eight miles long and thirty-six wide. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Some time after, they migrated to the region of the Jordan where they dwelt chiefly on Mount Horeb and on Mount Carmel.<br>
<sup>6</sup> In early times, before Isaias gathered them together, the Essenians lived scattered as pious, ascetic Jews. <br>
<sup>7</sup> They neither changed nor repaired their garments until they actually fell to pieces. <br>
<sup>8</sup> They married, but observed great continence in the married state. <br>
<sup>9</sup> With mutual consent, husband and wife frequently lived apart in distant huts. <br>
<sup>10</sup> They also ate apart, first the husband and on his departure the wife. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Even in those early times some of the forefathers of Anne and of other members of the Holy Family were found among them. <br>
<sup>12</sup> From them sprang those that are called the children of the Prophets. <br>
<sup>13</sup> They dwelt in the desert and around Mt. Horeb. <br>
<sup>14</sup> There were many of them likewise in Egypt. <br>
<sup>15</sup> For a long time war drove them from Mt. Horeb, but they were gathered together again by their Superiors. <br>
<sup>16</sup> The Machabees belonged to this sect. <br>
<sup>17</sup> They greatly revered Moses. <br>
<sup>18</sup> They had a piece of his garment. <br>
<sup>19</sup> He had given it to Aaron, and through the latter it came into the possession of the Essenians. <br>
<sup>20</sup> They preserved it as a sacred thing, and I had a vision in which I saw that fifteen of the Essenians had perished in its defense. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Their Superiors knew of the Mystery, the Holy Thing, in the Ark of the Covenant. <br>
<sup>22</sup> The unmarried among the Essenians formed a special congregation like a religious order. <br>
<sup>23</sup> They had to undergo a probation of long years before being admitted to it, and then they were received for a longer or a shorter time as the prophetical inspi-ration of Superiors might dictate. <br>
<sup>24</sup> The married Essenians, who exercised strict vigilance over their children and household, bore to the real Essenian Community the same spiritual relationship that the Franciscan Tertiaries do to the Franciscan Order. <br>
<sup>25</sup> In all affairs they were guided by the counsel of their spiritual Superior on Horeb.<br>
<sup>26</sup> The unmarried Essenians were unspeakably chaste and devout. <br>
<sup>27</sup> They wore long white garments, which they kept scrupulously clean. <br>
<sup>28</sup> They received children to educate. The aspirant to their rigid life had to be fourteen years old. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Postulants of advanced piety were kept only one year on probation; others, two years. <br>
<sup>30</sup> They lived in perfect chastity and carried on no kind of business; they exchanged their agricultural products for the various necessaries of life. <br>
<sup>31</sup> If anyone of their number were so unfortunate as to sin grievously, he was excommunicated, which excommunication was followed by consequences such as attended St. Peter’s malediction against Ananias—he died. <br>
<sup>32</sup> The Superior of the Essenians knew by divine inspiration whenever anyone had fallen into sin. <br>
<sup>33</sup> I saw also some who lived only to do penance; one, for instance, stood in a sort of stiff coat, with outstretched, inflexible sleeves, lined with prickles.<br>
<sup>34</sup> They had caves on Mt. Horeb which served as cells. <br>
<sup>35</sup> Attached to them by wicker-work was a large cave for general assembly. <br>
<sup>36</sup> At the eleventh hour all met here for a meal. <br>
<sup>37</sup> Each had before him a small loaf and cup. <br>
<sup>38</sup> The Superior went around and blessed the loaf of each. <br>
<sup>39</sup> The meal over, all returned to their own cells. In the large hall was an altar upon which lay blessed loaves. <br>
<sup>40</sup> They were covered and intended for distribution to the poor. <br>
<sup>41</sup> There were numbers of tame pigeons around which fed out of the hand. <br>
<sup>42</sup> The Essenians used these doves for food, also for religious ceremonies. <br>
<sup>43</sup> They uttered some words over them, and they let them flyaway. <br>
<sup>44</sup> I saw them also performing the same ceremony over lambs; they spoke some words over them and then let them run into the wilderness.<br>
<sup>45</sup> I saw that they went three times every year to the Temple of Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>46</sup> They had among them priests, whose special care was the preservation of the sacred vestments; they cleaned them and prepared new ones, to the purchase of which they had contributed. <br>
<sup>47</sup> I saw these people engaged in agriculture, in cattle raising, and especially in gardening. <br>
<sup>48</sup> That part of Mt. Horeb which lay around their cells was covered with gardens and fruit trees. <br>
<sup>49</sup> I saw many of them engaged likewise in weaving and platting, and in embroidering the sacerdotal garments. <br>
<sup>50</sup> I saw that they did not manufacture the silk themselves. It came in bundles for sale, and they exchanged their products for it.<br>
<sup>51</sup> In Jerusalem, they had a special dwelling place, also a particular part of the Temple assigned to them. <br>
<sup>52</sup> They were objects of dislike to the other Jews. <br>
<sup>53</sup> I saw them sending offerings to the Temple for sacrifice, huge bunches of grapes that two men carried between them on a pole, and lambs. <br>
<sup>54</sup> But these lambs were not slaughtered; they were allowed to run. <br>
<sup>55</sup> I never saw them bringing offerings for slaughter. <br>
<sup>56</sup> Before going up to the Temple, they prepared themselves by prayer, rigid fasting, disciplines, and other penitential exercises. <br>
<sup>57</sup> He who, with unatoned sins, ventured to the Temple, might fear a sudden death; and indeed, this happened to some. <br>
<sup>58</sup> If on their way to the Temple they met a person sick or helpless, they paused and went no further until they had in some manner assisted him. <br>
<sup>59</sup> I saw them gathering herbs and preparing teas. <br>
<sup>60</sup> They healed the sick .by the imposition of hands, or by stretching themselves upon them with extended arms. <br>
<sup>61</sup> I saw them also exerting their healing power at a distance. <br>
<sup>62</sup> If a sick person could not go himself to the Essenians, he sent to them another as his representative. <br>
<sup>63</sup> All that would have been done for the sick person himself, had he really been present, was done for his representative, and the sick man was cured at the same hour.<br>
<sup>64</sup> The Superior at the time of Anne’s grandparents was a Prophet named Archos. <br>
<sup>65</sup> He had visions in the cave of Elias on Horeb, which visions referred to the coming of the Messiah. <br>
<sup>66</sup> Archos knew from what family the Messiah would come and, when he prophesied to Anne’s grandparents concerning their posterity, he saw that the time was drawing near. <br>
<sup>67</sup> He knew not exactly how far off it was nor how it might still be retarded by sin; but he exhorted to penance and sacrifice.<br>
<sup>68</sup> Anne’s grandfather, an Essenian, was before his marriage called Stolanus; but by his wife and in consideration of her dowry, he received the name Garescha, or Sarziri. <br>
<sup>69</sup> Anne’s grandmother was of Mara in the desert. <br>
<sup>70</sup> Her name was Moruni, or Emorun, that is, She married Stolanus upon the advice of Archos, the Prophet, who was the Superior of the Essenians for about ninety years. <br>
<sup>71</sup> He was a very holy man with whom counsel was always taken by those intending to enter upon the married state, that they might make a good choice. <br>
<sup>72</sup> It seemed to me strange that this divinely enlightened Superior always prophesied respecting the female descendants, and that the ancestors of Anne, as well as Anne herself, always had daughters. <br>
<sup>73</sup> It was as if the religious education of the pure vessels that were to conceive the holy children destined to be the precursors of the disciples, of the Apostles, and of the Lord Himself, devolved upon them.<br>
<sup>74</sup> I saw Emorun going to Archos before her marriage. <br>
<sup>75</sup> She entered the hall on Horeb, passed thence into a side apartment, and conferred with the Superior through a grating like that of a confessional. <br>
<sup>76</sup> Then Archos went up a long flight of steps to the summit of the mountain where was found the cave of the Prophet Elias. <br>
<sup>77</sup> The entrance was narrow, and a few steps led down into the cave, which was neatly hollowed out. <br>
<sup>78</sup> The light fell through an opening in the vaulted roof. <br>
<sup>79</sup> I saw by the wall a small stone altar, upon which was the rod of Aaron and a shining chalice as of one precious stone. <br>
<sup>80</sup> In this chalice lay a portion of the Ark of the Covenant. <br>
<sup>81</sup> The Essenians had come into possession of it at a time when the Ark had fallen into the hands of the enemy. <br>
<sup>82</sup> The rod of Aaron stood in a little tree as in a box. <br>
<sup>83</sup> The tree had yellowish leaves wreathed in spirals. <br>
<sup>84</sup> I cannot say whether this little tree was really growing or whether it was artificial. <br>
<sup>85</sup> It was, for instance, something like a root of Jesse. <br>
<sup>86</sup> If the Superior prayed concerning a marriage, he took the rod of Aaron into his hand. <br>
<sup>87</sup> If the union in question would contribute to Mary’s lineage, the rod put forth a bud from which sprang one or more blossoms bearing the sign of the choice. <br>
<sup>88</sup> The forefathers of Anne were legitimate descendants of this lineage, and their chosen daughters had been by such signs designated. <br>
<sup>89</sup> New blossoms burst forth whenever a chosen daughter was to enter the married state. <br>
<sup>90</sup> The little tree with its spiral leaves was like a genealogical table, like the root of Jesse, and by it could be seen how far the advent of Mary was distant. <br>
<sup>91</sup> There were on the altar, also, some small bunches of herbs in pots. <br>
<sup>92</sup> Their flourishing or withering denoted something. <br>
<sup>93</sup> I saw all around on the walls grated compartments wherein were preserved ancient holy bones very beautifully encased in silk and wool. <br>
<sup>94</sup> They were the bones of Prophets and holy Israelites who had lived upon the mountain and in its vicinity. <br>
<sup>95</sup> I saw such bones in the cells or caves of the Essenians. <br>
<sup>96</sup> They used to place lighted lamps and flowers before them, and there offer prayers.<br>
<sup>97</sup> When Archos prayed in this cave, he was vested precisely like the High Priest in the Temple. <br>
<sup>98</sup> His clothing consisted of about eight pieces: First, he placed upon his breast a kind of broad scapular such as Moses used to wear next to his person. <br>
<sup>99</sup> It had an opening in the middle for the neck and fell in equal length before and behind. <br>
<sup>100</sup> Over this, he wore a white alb of twisted silk bound by a cincture that fastened also the wide stole which, crossing on the breast, reached down to the knee. <br>
<sup>101</sup> Over the alb was a kind of chasuble of white silk. <br>
<sup>102</sup> It reached to the ground behind, and had two little bells at the lower edge. <br>
<sup>103</sup> Around the neck was a standing collar buttoned in front. <br>
<sup>104</sup> The beard was parted over this collar. Last of all came a small, shining mantle of white untwisted silk. <br>
<sup>105</sup> It was fastened in front by three stone clasps upon which something was engraved, From either shoulder toward the breast ran a row of six precious stones, upon which also signs were engraved. <br>
<sup>106</sup> On the back of it and in the center, was a shield upon which were inscribed some letters. <br>
<sup>107</sup> This mantle was also adorned with fringes, tassels and artificial fruit. <br>
<sup>108</sup> On one arm he wore a short maniple. <br>
<sup>109</sup> The headdress was of white silk rolled in puffs one above another and ending in a silken tuft. <br>
<sup>110</sup> Over the forehead was a plate of gold set with precious stones.<br>
<sup>111</sup> Archos prayed prostrate on the earth before the altar. <br>
<sup>112</sup> I saw that he had a vision of a rose tree with three branches springing from Emorun. <br>
<sup>113</sup> On each branch was a rose, and that of the second was marked with a letter. <br>
<sup>114</sup> He saw also an angel writing letters on the wall. <br>
<sup>115</sup> In consequence of this vision, Archos told Emorun that she should marry her sixth suitor, that she should bring forth a chosen child who would bear a sign and who would be a vessel of the approaching Promise. <br>
<sup>116</sup> The sixth suitor was Stolanus. <br>
<sup>117</sup> The married pair did not dwell long in Mara; they removed to Ephron. <br>
<sup>118</sup> Again I saw their daughters, Emerentia and Ismeria, consulting with Archos. <br>
<sup>119</sup> He commanded them to embrace the married state, for they also were cooperating vessels of the Promise. <br>
<sup>120</sup> The elder one, Emerentia, married a Levite named Aphras, and became the mother of Elizabeth, who gave birth to John the Baptist. <br>
<sup>121</sup> A third daughter was named Enue. <br>
<sup>122</sup> Ismeria was the second daughter of Stolanus and Emorun. <br>
<sup>123</sup> She had at her birth the mark that Archos, in his vision of Emorun, had seen on the rose of the second branch. <br>
<sup>124</sup> Ismeria married Eliud, of the tribe of Levi. <br>
<sup>125</sup> They were wealthy, as I judged from their great household. <br>
<sup>126</sup> They owned many herds, but they kept nothing for themselves, they gave all to the poor. <br>
<sup>127</sup> They dwelt in Sephoris, four leagues from Nazareth, where they possessed property. <br>
<sup>128</sup> They had property also in the valley of Zabulon whither they used to remove in the warm season. <br>
<sup>129</sup> After Ismeria’s death, Eliud took up his abode there permanently. <br>
<sup>130</sup> Joachim’s father with his family had likewise settled in the same valley.<br>
<sup>131</sup> The eminent chastity and mortification of Stolanus and Emorun had descended to Ismeria and Eliud. <br>
<sup>132</sup> Ismeria’s first daughter was called Sobe. <br>
<sup>133</sup> She married Solomon, and became the mother of Mary Salome who married Zebedee and gave birth to the future Apostles, James the Greater and John. <br>
<sup>134</sup> When at Sobe’s birth, the sign of the Promise was not found on her, her parents were greatly troubled. <br>
<sup>135</sup> They journeyed to the Prophet on Horeb. He exhorted them to prayer and sacrifice, and promised them consolation. <br>
<sup>136</sup> For about eighteen years they were without children, and then Anne was born. <br>
<sup>137</sup> Both father and mother had the same vision one night upon their couch. <br>
<sup>138</sup> Ismeria saw an angel near her writing on the wall. <br>
<sup>139</sup> On awakening she told her husband, who also had had the same vision, and both still saw the written character on the wall. <br>
<sup>140</sup> It was the letter M. At her birth Anne brought with her into the world the same sign upon the region of the stomach.<br>
<sup>141</sup> Anne was especially dear to her parents. <br>
<sup>142</sup> I saw her as a child. She was not strikingly beautiful, though prettier than some others. <br>
<sup>143</sup> Her beauty was not to be compared with Mary’s, but she was extraordinarily pious, childlike, and innocent. <br>
<sup>144</sup> She was the same at every age, as I have seen, as a maiden, as a mother, and as a little old grandmother. <br>
<sup>145</sup> Whenever I happened to see a very childlike old peasant woman, I always thought: “She is like Anne.”<br>
<sup>146</sup> When in her fifth year, Anne was taken to the Temple as Mary was later. <br>
<sup>147</sup> There she remained twelve years, returning home in her seventeenth year. <br>
<sup>148</sup> Meantime, her mother had had a third daughter, whom she named Maraha, and Anne found also in the paternal house a little son of her eldest sister Sobe, who was called Eliud. <br>
<sup>149</sup> Maraha afterward inherited the paternal property of Sephoris and became the mother of the subsequent disciples, Arastaria and Cocharia. <br>
<sup>150</sup> The young Eliud was afterward the second husband of Maroni, of Naim.<br>
<sup>151</sup> One year later, Ismeria fell sick and died. <br>
<sup>152</sup> She called her household around her deathbed, gave them her parting advice, and appointed Anne as their future mistress. <br>
<sup>153</sup> Then she spoke alone with Anne, saying that she must marry, for that she was a vessel of the Promise. <br>
<sup>154</sup> About eighteen months after, Anne, then in her nineteenth year, married Heli, or Joachim, This she did in obedience to the spiritual direction of the Prophet. <br>
<sup>155</sup> On account of the approach of the Saviour’s advent, she married Joachim of the House of David, for Mary was to belong to the House of David; otherwise she would have had to choose her spouse from among the Levites of the tribe of Aaron, as all of her race had done. <br>
<sup>156</sup> She had had many suitors and, at the time of the Prophet’s decision, she was not yet acquainted with Joachim. <br>
<sup>157</sup> She chose him only upon supernatural direction.
Joachim was poor and a relative of St. Joseph. <br>
<sup>158</sup> Joseph’s grandfather Mathan had descended from David through Solomon. <br>
<sup>159</sup> He had two sons, Joses and Jacob. <br>
<sup>160</sup> The latter was Joseph’s father. <br>
<sup>161</sup> When Mathan died, his widow married a second husband named Levi, descendant of David through Nathan. <br>
<sup>162</sup> The fruit of this marriage was Mathat, the father of Heli, or Joachim. <br>
<sup>163</sup> Joachim was a short, broad, spare man. <br>
<sup>164</sup> St. Joseph, even in his old age, was very handsome compared with him. <br>
<sup>165</sup> However, in disposition and morals, Joachim was a superior man. <br>
<sup>166</sup> Like Anne, he had something very distinguished about him. <br>
<sup>167</sup> Both were true Israelites; but there was something in them that they themselves knew not, a yearning, a wonderful earnestness. <br>
<sup>168</sup> I have rarely seen either of them laugh, although in the early part of their married life they were not particularly grave. <br>
<sup>169</sup> Both possessed a calm, uniform disposition; even in early youth, they were something like sedate old people.<br>
<sup>170</sup> They were married in a small town that possessed only one obscure school, and only one priest presided at the ceremony. 
Courtship in those days was carried on very simply. <br>
<sup>171</sup> The lovers were very reserved. <br>
<sup>172</sup> They consulted each other on the subject and regarded their marriage merely as something inevitable. <br>
<sup>173</sup> If the young girl said yes, her parents were satisfied; if no, and could she give good reasons for her refusal, they looked upon the affair as ended. <br>
<sup>174</sup> First the matter was settled before the parents, and then the promises were made before the priest in the synagogue. <br>
<sup>175</sup> The priest prayed in the sanctuary before the rolls of the Law, the parents in their accustomed place, while the young couple in an adjoining apartment deliberated in private over their intention and contract. <br>
<sup>176</sup> When they had taken their determination, they declared it to their parents. <br>
<sup>177</sup> The latter again conferred with the priest, who now went to meet the couple outside the sanctuary. <br>
<sup>178</sup> The nuptial ceremony was celebrated the next day.<br>
<sup>179</sup> Joachim and Anne lived with Eliud, Anne’s father. <br>
<sup>180</sup> There reigned throughout his household the severe usages and discipline of the Essenians. <br>
<sup>181</sup> The house lay in the environs of Sephoris. <br>
<sup>182</sup> It formed one of a group of houses of which it was the largest. <br>
<sup>183</sup> Here Joachim and Anne dwelt seven years.<br>
<sup>184</sup> Anne’s parents were in good circumstances. <br>
<sup>185</sup> They had numerous herds and a house handsomely furnished with beautiful carpets, table furniture, etc. The servants, men and women, were many. <br>
<sup>186</sup> I never saw them engaged in agriculture, but herding cattle on the pasture grounds. <br>
<sup>187</sup> Ismeria and Eliud were pious, devout, charitable, and just. <br>
<sup>188</sup> They frequently divided their herds and other possessions into three parts: one part for the Temple, whither they drove it themselves and where it was received by the servants of the Temple; a second part they gave to the poor or to their needy relatives, some of whom were generally present to receive it; and the third part they reserved for their own use. <br>
<sup>189</sup> They lived very frugally and gave to all that asked help. <br>
<sup>190</sup> When I saw all this, even in childhood, I thought: Giving lasts long. <br>
<sup>191</sup> He who gives gets back double, for I perceived that the third part again rapidly increased. <br>
<sup>192</sup> It was soon so large that it could be again divided into three parts as before. <br>
<sup>193</sup> They had many relatives who upon all solemn occasions assembled at their house. <br>
<sup>194</sup> But I never even on those occasions saw much feasting. <br>
<sup>195</sup> Food was indeed distributed among the poor, but grand entertainments I never saw. <br>
<sup>196</sup> At these assemblies the guests generally reclined in circles on the ground, and conversed of God with earnest expectancy. <br>
<sup>197</sup> It frequently happened that some of these relatives were bad people. <br>
<sup>198</sup> They looked angry and displeased when Eliud and Ismeria, full of heavenly longing, glanced upward as they spoke of God. <br>
<sup>199</sup> But to these evil-minded people, the holy couple were ever kind; they never omitted to invite them to their reunions, and they gave twice as much to them as to others. <br>
<sup>200</sup> I used to see that they, with bitter feelings, impatiently coveted what Eliud and Ismeria gave them with so much good will. <br>
<sup>201</sup> It was no uncommon thing for the holy couple to give sheep, sometimes one, sometimes more, to the poor belonging to them.<br>
<sup>202</sup> Here in her father’s house, Anne gave birth to her first daughter, who was called Mary. <br>
<sup>203</sup> I saw her full of joy over her newborn babe. <br>
<sup>204</sup> It was a lovely child. <br>
<sup>205</sup> I saw it growing stout and strong. <br>
<sup>206</sup> It was gentle and pious, and the parents loved it. <br>
<sup>207</sup> But yet, there was something about the child that I could not understand, something that indicated that it was not the one looked forward to by the parents as the fruit of their union. <br>
<sup>208</sup> There was always a shade of trouble and anxiety about them, as if they had offended God, therefore they did penance, lived in continence, and multiplied their good works. <br>
<sup>209</sup> I often saw them going apart to pray.<br>
<sup>210</sup> They had lived in this way with their father, Eliud, seven years (which I could guess by the age of their first child), when they resolved to withdraw from the paternal house. <br>
<sup>211</sup> Their design was to live in privacy, to begin their married life anew and, by performing actions pleasing to God, to draw down His benediction upon their union. <br>
<sup>212</sup> I saw them take this resolution in the paternal home and I also saw Eliud setting aside a portion of his riches for them. <br>
<sup>213</sup> The herds were divided, oxen, asses, and sheep set apart for the new household. <br>
<sup>214</sup> The animals named were much larger than those of our country. <br>
<sup>215</sup> On the asses and oxen were packed all kinds of movables, furniture and clothing. <br>
<sup>216</sup> The good people were as skillful in packing as were the animals ready to receive and carry away their loads.<br>
<sup>217</sup> We do not pack our goods so skillfully on our wagons as these people could upon their beasts. <br>
<sup>218</sup> They had beautiful vessels, all more highly ornamented than those of the present day. <br>
<sup>219</sup> Beautiful, fragile, curiously-shaped pitchers, upon which were all kinds of ornamentation like carving, were stuffed with moss, enveloped in wrappings, fastened to the ends of a strap, and hung over the back of the animals upon which were laid bundles of colored covers and garments. <br>
<sup>220</sup> Some of the covers were embroidered in gold and were very costly. <br>
<sup>221</sup> Father Eliud gave the departing couple a small, but heavy lump of something in a bag; it was like a lump of gold, of precious metal. <br>
<sup>222</sup> When all was ready, the servant men and maids formed in procession and drove the herds and beasts of burden before them toward the new dwelling, about five or six leagues distant.<br>
<sup>223</sup> The house stood upon a hill between the vale of Nazareth and the valley of Zabulon. <br>
<sup>224</sup> A terebinthine walk led to it. <br>
<sup>225</sup> In front of it, on a bare, stony foundation, was a courtyard surrounded by a low stone wall, upon or behind which grew a hedge. <br>
<sup>226</sup> On one side of this courtyard were sheds for the cattle. <br>
<sup>227</sup> The door of the house, which was tolerably large, was in the center of the building and hung upon hinges. <br>
<sup>228</sup> Through it one entered a kind of anteroom, which extended the whole breadth of the house. <br>
<sup>229</sup> Right and left of the hall were small apartments cut off by lightly woven partitions, or screens, that could be removed at pleasure. <br>
<sup>230</sup> It was in this hall that the principal meals were laid on feasts as, for instance, when Mary was taken to the Temple. <br>
<sup>231</sup> Opposite the entrance, a light wicker door led from the hall into a passage upon either side of which were four apartments lying right and left. <br>
<sup>232</sup> They were separated by movable wicker partitions, the upper part ending in gratings. <br>
<sup>233</sup> These partitions were so placed as to form a rounded, or rather a kind of triangular space, in the middle of whose central side, just opposite the door, was the fireplace. <br>
<sup>234</sup> Behind the two oblique sides, right and left, were other chambers. <br>
<sup>235</sup> In the center of this kitchen there hung from the ceiling a many-branched lamp. <br>
<sup>236</sup> Around the house were fields and orchards.<br>
<sup>237</sup> When Joachim and Anne entered their new abode, they found everything in order, owing to the diligence of the domestics who had preceded them. <br>
<sup>238</sup> They had unpacked all things as nicely and carefully as they had packed them, and everything was in its place. <br>
<sup>239</sup> Anne’s servants were so handy, they did everything quietly and intelligently. <br>
<sup>240</sup> They were not like the servants of our day, who have to be told every single thing.<br>
<sup>241</sup> And now the holy couple began here a new married life. <br>
<sup>242</sup> They made a sacrifice to God of all the preceding years, and began again as if they had only just now been united. <br>
<sup>243</sup> Their only aim was by a life pleasing to God, to attract upon themselves that blessing for which alone they sighed. <br>
<sup>244</sup> I saw them both going to and fro among their herds. <br>
<sup>245</sup> They divided them into three parts, and drove the best to the Temple. <br>
<sup>246</sup> The poor received the second part, and the worst was retained for themselves. <br>
<sup>247</sup> They acted in the same manner with all that belonged to them.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Holy and Immaculate Conception of Mary</p>

 
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Anne had the assurance, the firm belief that the coming of the Messiah was very near, and that she herself would be of the number of His relatives according to the flesh.  <br>
<sup>2</sup> Her prayer was continuous and she constantly aimed at greater purity.  <br>
<sup>3</sup> It had been revealed to her that she was to bring forth a child of benediction.  <br>
<sup>4</sup> Her firstborn daughter, who had remained with her grandfather Eliud, Anne recognized and loved as her own and Joachim’s child; but she felt certain that she was not the child whom, by interior enlightenment, she knew that she was to bear.  <br>
<sup>5</sup> For nineteen years and five months after the birth of this first child, Joachim and Anne were childless.  <br>
<sup>6</sup> They lived in continued prayer and sacrifice, in mortification and continency.  <br>
<sup>7</sup> I frequently saw them dividing their herds, which rapidly multiplied again.  <br>
<sup>8</sup> Joachim often remained far away with his flocks in humble supplication to God. <br>
<sup>9</sup> The anxiety of both and their longing after the promised blessing had reached their height.  <br>
<sup>10</sup> Many of their acquaintances upbraided them because of their sterility, which they attributed to some wickedness.  <br>
<sup>11</sup> They said that the child living with Eliud was not really Anne’s daughter, otherwise she would have it with her.  <br>
<sup>12</sup> When Joachim, absent with the herds, went again to the Temple to offer sacrifice, Anne used to send servants out to the fields to him with numbers of things, doves, and other birds in baskets and cages.  <br>
<sup>13</sup> Joachim loaded two asses from the meadow with them, also with three little long-necked animals, white and nimble, and lambs and kids in wicker baskets.  <br>
<sup>14</sup> He carried a lantern at the end of a stick; it looked like a light in a scooped-out gourd.  <br>
<sup>15</sup> I saw him with his offerings journeying over a beautiful green field between Bethania and Jerusalem.  <br>
<sup>16</sup> I often saw Jesus in the same spot. Toward evening, Joachim reached the Temple.  <br>
<sup>17</sup> The asses were stabled in the same place as subsequently at Mary’s Presentation, and the offerings were carried up the steps of the Mount that led to the Temple.  <br>
<sup>18</sup> When they had been received by the attendants, Joachim’s servants returned while he himself went on into the hall in which were the water basins for the cleansing of the gifts.  <br>
<sup>19</sup> Thence he passed through a long corridor to a hall upon the left of the Sanctuary where were the altar of incense, the table of show bread, and the seven-branched candlestick.  <br>
<sup>20</sup> The hall was filled with those that had brought offerings.  <br>
<sup>21</sup> Joachim was received in a very contemptuous manner by a priest named Reuben, who would scarcely admit him.  <br>
<sup>22</sup> He was shoved into a corner behind a grating, and his offerings were not, like those of others, conspicuously placed behind the gratings to the right of the courtyard, but indifferently set on one side.  <br>
<sup>23</sup> The priests were around the altar of incense, upon which an offering was being made.  <br>
<sup>24</sup> Lamps were burning, and lights were lit on the seven branched candlestick, but not all seven at once.  <br>
<sup>25</sup> I have often noticed that different arms of the candlestick were lighted on different occasions. <br>
<sup>26</sup> I saw Joachim leaving the Temple in great trouble.  <br>
<sup>27</sup> He went from Jerusalem through Bethania, and into the country of Machaerus, where he sought consolation in the house of an Essenian.  <br>
<sup>28</sup> The Prophet Manahem had once dwelt here, and also in the family of an Essenian at Bethania.  <br>
<sup>29</sup> This Prophet had foretold to Herod while still a child his future kingdom and wickedness.  <br>
<sup>30</sup> From this place, Joachim went to his most distant herds on Mount Hermon.  <br>
<sup>31</sup> The way led through the wilderness of Gaddi and over the Jordan.  <br>
<sup>32</sup> Hermon is a long, narrow, unbroken mountain whose sunny side is green and blooming when the other is still covered with snow.  <br>
<sup>33</sup> Joachim was so dejected, so mortified that he would not allow his people to inform Anne where he was staying, while the trouble of the latter when she heard how things had gone at the Temple and saw that Joachim did not return home, was indescribable.  <br>
<sup>34</sup> For five months Joachim thus remained in concealment on Hermon.  <br>
<sup>35</sup> I saw him praying and weeping.  <br>
<sup>36</sup> When he went to look after his flocks and his lambs, he was often so overcome by sadness that he cast himself with covered face prostrate on the ground.  <br>
<sup>37</sup> His servants questioned him upon the cause of his grief.  <br>
<sup>38</sup> But he did not tell them that it was because he was childless.  <br>
<sup>39</sup> Again he divided his magnificent herds into three parts.  <br>
<sup>40</sup> The best he sent to the Temple, the second to the Essenians, and the least he kept for himself. <br>
<sup>41</sup> Anne, in the midst of her anxiety, had much to endure also from an insolent maid servant who bit-terly taunted her with her sterility.  <br>
<sup>42</sup> She bore with her a long time, but at last she sent her from the house.  <br>
<sup>43</sup> The maid had requested permission to go to a feast.  <br>
<sup>44</sup> This was not in accordance with the strict discipline of the Essenians.  <br>
<sup>45</sup> Anne refused the permission, and then the maid reproached her, telling her that she deserved to be sterile and abandoned by her husband on account of her harsh and unreasonable temper.  <br>
<sup>46</sup> Then Anne sent her, with gifts and accompanied by two servants, back to her parents, that they might receive her safe and sound as she had come to her.  <br>
<sup>47</sup> She sent them also the message that she could no longer take charge of their daughter.  <br>
<sup>48</sup> After the girl’s departure, Anne went in sadness to her chamber and prayed.  <br>
<sup>49</sup> When evening closed, she threw a long scarf over her head and enveloped herself entirely in it, took a covered light beneath her mantle, went out under a spreading tree that stood in the courtyard, lit the lamp and prayed.  <br>
<sup>50</sup> This tree was one of those whose branches strike root again and again, and thus form a whole tract of covered walk under their foliage.  <br>
<sup>51</sup> Its leaves are very large.  <br>
<sup>52</sup> I think it was with such that Adam and Eve clothed themselves in Paradise.  <br>
<sup>53</sup> The whole tree had the characteristics of that of the forbidden fruit.  <br>
<sup>54</sup> The pear shaped fruit hung usually in fives at the end of the branches.  <br>
<sup>55</sup> It was fleshy inside with blood-colored veins; in its center was a hollow space in which reposed the kernel.  <br>
<sup>56</sup> The Jews made use of the large leaves chiefly at the Feast of Tabernacles.  <br>
<sup>57</sup> They adorned the walls with them, laying them like the scales of a fish, so that their edges closely fitted together.  <br>
<sup>58</sup> The tree was surrounded by groves and seats. <br>
<sup>59</sup> When Anne had long besought God not to separate her from Joachim, her pious husband, although He had been pleased to deprive her of children, an angel appeared to her.  <br>
<sup>60</sup> He hovered above her in the air. He told her to set her heart at rest, for the Lord had heard her prayer; that she should on the following morning go with two of her maid servants to the Temple of Jerusalem; that there under the Golden Gate, entering by the side of the valley of Josaphat, she should meet Joachim, who was even now on his way thither, that Joachim’s offering would be accepted, that his prayer would be heard, that he (the angel) had appeared also to him.  <br>
<sup>61</sup> The angel likewise directed Anne to take some doves with her as an offering, and promised that the name of the child she was soon to conceive should be made known to her. <br>
<sup>62</sup> Anne thanked the Lord and returned to the house.  <br>
<sup>63</sup> When, after her lengthy prayer, she lay on her couch asleep I saw light descending upon her.  <br>
<sup>64</sup> It surrounded her, yes, even penetrated her.  <br>
<sup>65</sup> I saw her, upon an interior perception, tremblingly awake and sit upright.  <br>
<sup>66</sup> Near her, to the right, she saw a luminous figure writing on the wall in large, shining Hebrew characters.  <br>
<sup>67</sup> I read and understood the writing word for word.  <br>
<sup>68</sup> It was to this effect: that she should conceive, that the fruit of her womb should be altogether special, and that the Blessing received by Abraham was to be the source of this conception.  <br>
<sup>69</sup> I saw Anne’s anxiety as to how she should communicate all that to Joachim; but the angel reassured her by telling her of Joachim’s vision.  <br>
<sup>70</sup> I received then a clear explanation of Mary’s Immaculate Conception.  <br>
<sup>71</sup> I saw that, in the Ark of the Covenant, a sacrament of the Incarnation, of the Immaculate Conception, a Mystery for the restoration of fallen humanity was contained.  <br>
<sup>72</sup> I saw Anne, with surprise and joy, reading the red and golden letters of this luminous writing.  <br>
<sup>73</sup> Her gladness increased to such a degree that, when she arose to set out for Jerusalem, she looked far younger than before.  <br>
<sup>74</sup> I saw on Anne’s person at the instant the angel appeared to her a beam of light and in her a shining vessel.  <br>
<sup>75</sup> I cannot better describe it than by saying that it was like a cradle, or a tabernacle which had been closed but was now opened, and made ready to receive a holy thing.  <br>
<sup>76</sup> How wonderfully I saw this, is not to be expressed; for I saw it as if it were the cradle of salvation for the whole human race, and also as a kind of sacred vessel now opened, and the veil withdrawn.  <br>
<sup>77</sup> I saw it quite naturally as if one and the same holy thing. <br>
<sup>78</sup> I saw, too, the apparition of the angel to Joachim.  <br>
<sup>79</sup> The angel commanded him to take his offering up to the Temple, promised that his prayer should be heard, and told him that he should pass under the Golden Gate.  <br>
<sup>80</sup> At this announcement, Joachim was troubled.  <br>
<sup>81</sup> He felt very timid about going again to the Temple.  <br>
<sup>82</sup> But the angel assured him that the priests had already been enlightened with regard to him.  <br>
<sup>83</sup> It was the time of the Feast of Tabernacles.  <br>
<sup>84</sup> Joachim and his shepherds had already erected their tabernacles.  <br>
<sup>85</sup> With a large herd of cattle as an offering, Joachim reached Jerusalem on the fourth day of the feast, and put up near the Temple.  <br>
<sup>86</sup> Anne arrived in Jerusalem also on the fourth day of the feast.  <br>
<sup>87</sup> She stopped with the family of Zacharias near the fish market, and met Joachim for the first time only at the end of the feast. <br>
<sup>88</sup> When Joachim approached the Temple, two of the priests came out to meet him.  <br>
<sup>89</sup> They did this acting upon a divine inspiration. Joachim had brought with him two lambs and three kids.  <br>
<sup>90</sup> His offering was accepted, slaughtered, and burned at the customary place in the Temple.  <br>
<sup>91</sup> But a part of it was taken and burned at another place to the right of the entrance porch, in the center of which stood the large teacher’s desk. <br>
<sup>92</sup> When the smoke arose, I saw a beam of light descend upon Joachim and the officiating priest.  <br>
<sup>93</sup> There was a pause, the beholders looked on in amazement, and I saw two priests go out to Joachim and lead him through the side apartments into the Sanctuary before the altar of incense.  <br>
<sup>94</sup> Then the priests laid incense upon the altar, not in grains but in the lump; it kindled of itself.  <br>
<sup>95</sup> The priests immediately retired to a distance and left Joachim alone before the altar.  <br>
<sup>96</sup> I saw him on his knees, his arms extended, while the incense offering slowly consumed itself.  <br>
<sup>97</sup> He remained shut up in the Temple all night, praying with great and ardent desires.  <br>
<sup>98</sup> I saw that he was in ecstasy.  <br>
<sup>99</sup> A luminous figure appeared to him in the same manner as to Zachary, and gave him a roll written in shining letters.  <br>
<sup>100</sup> On it were the three names: Helia, Hanna, Mirjam, and near the last one the picture of a little Ark of the Covenant, or a tabernacle.  <br>
<sup>101</sup> Joachim laid the roll on his breast under his garment.  <br>
<sup>102</sup> The angel spoke: “Anne will conceive an immaculate child from whom the Redeemer of the world will be born.”  <br>
<sup>103</sup> The angel told him moreover not to grieve over his sterility which was not a disgrace to him, but a glory, for that what his spouse would conceive should not be from him but through him, a fruit from God, the culminating point of the Blessing given to Abraham.  <br>
<sup>104</sup> I saw that Joachim could not comprehend these words.  <br>
<sup>105</sup> Then the angel led him behind the curtain that con-cealed the grating before the Holy of Holies.  <br>
<sup>106</sup> The space between the curtain and the grating afforded standing room.  <br>
<sup>107</sup> Then the angel held up before Joachim’s face a shining ball that reflected like a mirror.  <br>
<sup>108</sup> Joachim breathed upon it and gazed into it.  <br>
<sup>109</sup> When I saw the angel holding the ball so close to Joachim’s face, I thought of a custom in use at our country weddings, where one kisses a painted head and gives fourteen pennies to the sexton.  <br>
<sup>110</sup> And now, as if called up by the breath of Joachim, appeared all kinds of pictures in the globe.  <br>
<sup>111</sup> He saw them clearly, for his breath did not dim them.  <br>
<sup>112</sup> It seemed to me that the angel then said to him that Anne should conceive although remaining just as unsullied by him as this ball.  <br>
<sup>113</sup> The angel then took it from Joachim and raised it on high.  <br>
<sup>114</sup> I saw it hovering in the air and, as if through an opening, innumerable and wonderful pictures went into it.  <br>
<sup>115</sup> They were like a whole world, one picture growing out of another.  <br>
<sup>116</sup> Up in the highest point appeared the Most Holy Trinity, and below, to one side, were Paradise, Adam and Eve, the Fall, the Promise of a Redeemer, Noe, the Ark, scenes connected with Abraham and Moses, the Ark of the Covenant, and numerous symbols of Mary.  <br>
<sup>117</sup> I saw cities, towers, gateways, flowers, all wonderfully connected together by beams of light like bridges.  <br>
<sup>118</sup> They were all assaulted and combated by beasts and spirits, which, however, were everywhere beaten back by the streams of light that burst upon them. <br>
<sup>119</sup> I saw also a garden enclosed by a dense thorn hedge.  <br>
<sup>120</sup> All kinds of horrible animals were trying to enter, but could not.  <br>
<sup>121</sup> I saw a tower stormed by numerous warriors who were, however, always repulsed. <br>
<sup>122</sup> And in this way I saw innumerable pictures all bearing some reference to Mary.  <br>
<sup>123</sup> They were bound together by passages or bridges.  <br>
<sup>124</sup> In them I saw obstacles, hindrances, struggles, all of which were overcome, and the pictures disappeared successively on the opposite side of the globe, as if they had entered into the Heavenly Jerusalem.  <br>
<sup>125</sup> But as I gazed at them dissolving in the interior of the globe, the globe itself mounted on high and I saw it no more. <br>
<sup>126</sup> The angel now removed something from the Ark of the Covenant, though without opening the door.  <br>
<sup>127</sup> It was the Mystery of the Ark, the Sacrament of the Incarnation, the Immaculate Conception, the Consummation of the Blessing of Abraham.  <br>
<sup>128</sup> I beheld it under the appearance of a luminous body.  <br>
<sup>129</sup> The angel blessed or anointed Joachim’s forehead with the tip of his thumb and forefinger; then he slipped the shining body under Joachim’s garment and it entered into him, how I cannot say.  <br>
<sup>130</sup> He also gave him something to drink out of a glittering chalice which he held sup-ported by two fingers.  <br>
<sup>131</sup> The chalice was of the same shape as that used at the Last Supper, but without a foot.  <br>
<sup>132</sup> Joachim was directed to take it with him and keep it at his home. <br>
<sup>133</sup> I understood that the angel forbade Joachim to reveal anything about this Holy Mystery; and then, too, I understood why Zacharias, the father of the Baptist, was struck dumb after receiving the blessing and the promise of Elizabeth’s fruitfulness through the Mystery of the Ark of the Covenant.  <br>
<sup>134</sup> Not till later was this Mystery missed from the Ark by the priests.  <br>
<sup>135</sup> Then were they at first confounded; afterward they became altogether pharisaical.  <br>
<sup>136</sup> The angel now led Joachim out of the Holy of Holies and vanished.  <br>
<sup>137</sup> Joachim lay on the ground like one stupefied. <br>
<sup>138</sup> I saw the priests enter the Sanctuary, lead Joachim out reverently, and place him upon a seat that stood on a raised platform where usually only priests sat.  <br>
<sup>139</sup> The seat was almost like that used by Magdalen in her grandeur.  <br>
<sup>140</sup> They bathed his face, held something to his nose, and gave him to drink; in short, they treated him as one in a swoon.  <br>
<sup>141</sup> Joachim was, by virtue of what he had received from the angel, quite radiant.  <br>
<sup>142</sup> He looked as if he had returned to the bloom of youth. <br>
<sup>143</sup> Joachim was afterward conducted by the priests to the entrance of the subterranean passage that ran under the Temple and under the Golden Gate.  <br>
<sup>144</sup> This was a passage set aside for special purposes.  <br>
<sup>145</sup> Under certain circumstances, penitents were conducted by it for purification, reconciliation, and absolution.  <br>
<sup>146</sup> The priests parted from Joachim at the entrance, and he went alone into the narrow, gradually widening, and almost imperceptibly descending passage.  <br>
<sup>147</sup> In it stood pillars twined with foliage.  <br>
<sup>148</sup> They looked like trees and vines, and the green and gold decorations of the walls sparkled in the rosy light that fell from above.  <br>
<sup>149</sup> Joachim had accomplished a third part of the way when Anne met him in the center of the passage directly under the Golden Gate, where stood a pillar like a palm tree with hanging leaves and fruit.  <br>
<sup>150</sup> Anne had been conducted into the subterranean passage through an entrance at the opposite end by the priest to whom she and her maid had brought the offering of doves in baskets, and to whom also she had told what the angel had revealed to her.  <br>
<sup>151</sup> She was also accompanied by some women, among them the Prophetess Anna. <br>
<sup>152</sup> I saw Joachim and Anne embrace each other in ecstasy.  <br>
<sup>153</sup> They were surrounded by hosts of angels, some floating over them carrying a luminous tower like that which we see in the pictures of the Litany of Loretto.  <br>
<sup>154</sup> The tower vanished between Joachim and Anne, both of whom were encompassed by brilliant light and glory.  <br>
<sup>155</sup> At the same moment the heavens above them opened, and I saw the joy of the Most Holy Trinity and of the angels over the Conception of Mary.  <br>
<sup>156</sup> Both Joachim and Anne were in a supernatural state.  <br>
<sup>157</sup> I learned that, at the moment in which they embraced and the light shone around them, the Immaculate Conception of Mary was accomplished.  <br>
<sup>158</sup> I was also told that Mary was conceived just as conception would have been effected, were it not for the fall of man. <br>
<sup>159</sup> After this, Joachim and Anne, praising God, turned toward the outer gate of the passage.  <br>
<sup>160</sup> They went under an arch into a space like a chapel where numerous lights were burning.  <br>
<sup>161</sup> Thence they passed to the gate where they were received by the priests who accompanied them back.  <br>
<sup>162</sup> The Temple was all thrown open and decorated with garlands of leaves and fruit.  <br>
<sup>163</sup> Divine service was performed under the open sky.  <br>
<sup>164</sup> In one place stood eight pillars at some distance from one another, and over them were twined garlands of green. <br>
<sup>165</sup> Joachim and Anne went for awhile to one of the priests’ houses in Jerusalem, and then immediately journeyed homeward.  <br>
<sup>166</sup> I saw them in Nazareth holding an entertainment at which many of the poor were fed and presented with alms.  <br>
<sup>167</sup> Joachim received numerous congratulations upon the acceptance of his offering. <br>
<sup>168</sup> Upon their arrival home, the holy couple published the mercy of God with feeling, joy, and devotion.  <br>
<sup>169</sup> From that time they lived in perfect continence and in great fear of God.  <br>
<sup>170</sup> I received at this time an instruction upon the great influence exerted upon children by the purity, the continence, and the mortification of parents. <br>
<sup>171</sup> Four and one-half months less three days after St. Anne had conceived under the Golden Gate, I saw the soul of Mary, formed by the Most Holy Trinity, in movement.  <br>
<sup>172</sup> I saw the Divine Persons interpenetrating one another.  <br>
<sup>173</sup> It became a great shining mountain, and still like the figure of a man.  <br>
<sup>174</sup> I saw something from the midst of the Three Divine Persons rising toward the mouth and issuing from it like a beam of light.  <br>
<sup>175</sup> This beam hovered before the face of God and assumed a human shape, or rather it was formed to such.  <br>
<sup>176</sup> As it took the human form, I saw it, as if by the command of God, most beautifully fashioned.  <br>
<sup>177</sup> I saw God showing the beauty of this soul to the angels, and from it they experienced unspeakable joy. <br>
<sup>178</sup> I saw that soul united to the living body of Mary in Anne’s womb.  <br>
<sup>179</sup> Anne lay asleep upon her couch.  <br>
<sup>180</sup> I saw a light hovering over her and from it a beam descending toward the middle of her side.  <br>
<sup>181</sup> I saw that beam enter into her in the form of a small, luminous, human figure.  <br>
<sup>182</sup> At the same instant Anne sat up.  <br>
<sup>183</sup> She was entirely surrounded by light, and she had a vision.  <br>
<sup>184</sup> She saw her own person, open as it were and in it, as if in a tabernacle, a holy, luminous virgin from whom proceeded all salvation.  <br>
<sup>185</sup> I saw, too, that this was the instant that Mary first moved in her mother’s womb. <br>
<sup>186</sup> Anne arose and announced to Joachim what had taken place.  <br>
<sup>187</sup> Then she went out to pray under the tree beneath which a child had been promised to her.  <br>
<sup>188</sup> I learned that Mary’s soul animated her body five days earlier than is customary with ordinary children, and that she was born twelve days sooner.</p><br>
