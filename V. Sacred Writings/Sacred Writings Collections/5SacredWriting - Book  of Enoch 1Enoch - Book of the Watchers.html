        <!-------------------------------START OF LESSON 1  ------------------------------->
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        
              
                    <p><sup>1</sup> The words of the blessing of Enoch, wherewith he blessed the elect and righteous, who will be living in the day of tribulation, when all the wicked and godless are to be removed.</p>

                    <p><sup>2</sup> And he took up his parable and said -Enoch a righteous man, whose eyes were opened by God, saw the vision of the Holy One in the heavens, which the angels showed me, and from them I heard everything, and from them I understood as I saw, but not for this generation, but for a remote one which is for to come.</p>

                    <p><sup>3</sup> Concerning the elect I said, and took up my parable concerning them:</p>
                         
                    
                    <p>The Holy Great One will come forth from His dwelling,</p> <br>

                    <p><sup>4</sup> And the eternal God will tread upon the earth, (even) on Mount Sinai, <br>
                    [And appear from His camp] <br>
                    And appear in the strength of His might from the heaven of heavens.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And all shall be smitten with fear <br>
                    And the Watchers shall quake, <br>
                    And great fear and trembling shall seize them unto the ends of the earth.</p>
             
                    
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And the high mountains shall be shaken, <br>
                    And the high hills shall be made low, <br>
                    And shall melt like wax before the flame</p>
             
                    
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And the earth shall be wholly rent in sunder, <br>
                    And all that is upon the earth shall perish, <br>
                    And there shall be a judgement upon all (men).</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>8</sup> But with the righteous He will make peace.</p>
                    
                    <p>And will protect the elect, <br>
                    And mercy shall be upon them.</p>
                    
                    <p>And they shall all belong to God, <br>
                    And they shall be prospered, <br>
                    And they shall all be blessed.</p>
                    
                    <p>And He will help them all, <br>
                    And light shall appear unto them, <br>
                    And He will make peace with them'.</p>
                 
                    
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones <br>
                    To execute judgement upon all, <br>
                    And to destroy all the ungodly:</p>
                    
                    <p>And to convict all flesh <br>
                    Of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed, <br>
                    And of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him. </p>
                             
        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> Observe ye everything that takes place in the heaven, how they do not change their orbits, and the  luminaries which are in the heaven, how they all rise and set in order each in its season, and transgress not against their appointed order.</p>

                    <p><sup>2</sup> Behold ye the earth, and give heed to the things which take place upon it from first to last, how steadfast they are, how none of the things upon earth change, but all the works of God appear to you.</p> 

		                <p><sup>3</sup> Behold the summer and the winter, how the whole earth is filled with water, and clouds and dew and rain lie upon it.</p>
                    
                    
        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> Observe and see how (in the winter) all the trees seem as though they had withered and shed all their leaves, except fourteen trees, which do not lose their foliage but retain the old foliage from two to three years till the new comes.</p>
                    
                    
        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And again, observe ye the days of summer how the sun is above the earth over against it.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup>And you seek shade and shelter by reason of the heat of the sun, and the earth also burns with growing heat, and so you cannot tread on the earth, or on a rock by reason of its heat.</p>
                    
        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> Observe ye how the trees cover themselves with green leaves and bear fruit: wherefore give ye heed and know with regard to all His works, and recognize how He that liveth for ever hath made them so.</p> 

		                <p><sup>2</sup> And all His works go on thus from year to year for ever, and all the tasks which they accomplish for Him, and their tasks change not, but according as God hath ordained so is it done.</p>

		                <p><sup>3</sup> And behold how the sea and the rivers in like manner accomplish and change not their tasks from His commandments.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>4</sup> But ye -ye have not been steadfast, nor done the commandments of the Lord, <br>
                    But ye have turned away and spoken proud and hard words <br>
                    With your impure mouths against His greatness. <br>
                    Oh, ye hard-hearted, ye shall find no peace.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>5</sup> Therefore shall ye execrate your days, <br>
                    And the years of your life shall perish, <br>
                    And the years of your destruction shall be multiplied in eternal execration, <br>
                    And ye shall find no mercy.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>6</sup> In those days ye shall make your names an eternal execration unto all the righteous, <br>
                    And by you shall all who curse, curse, <br>
                    And all the sinners and godless shall imprecate by you, <br>
                    And for you the godless there shall be a curse.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And all the . . . shall rejoice, <br>
                    And there shall be forgiveness of sins, <br>
                    And every mercy and peace and forbearance: <br>
                    There shall be salvation unto them, a goodly light.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>And for all of you sinners there shall be no salvation, <br>
                    But on you all shall abide a curse. <br>
                    But for the elect there shall be light and joy and peace, <br>
                    And they shall inherit the earth.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And then there shall be bestowed upon the elect wisdom, <br>
                    And they shall all live and never again sin, <br>
                    Either through ungodliness or through pride: <br>
                    But they who are wise shall be humble.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And they shall not again transgress, <br>
                    Nor shall they sin all the days of their life, <br>
                    Nor shall they die of (the divine) anger or wrath, <br>
                    But they shall complete the number of the days of their life.</p>
                    
                    <p>And their lives shall be increased in peace, <br>
                    And the years of their joy shall be multiplied, <br>
                    In eternal gladness and peace, <br>
                    All the days of their life.</p>
                    
                    
         <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters.</p> 

		                <p><sup>2</sup> And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: 'Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children.'</p> 

		                <p><sup>3</sup> And Semjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: 'I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this deed,
                    and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin.'</p> 

		                <p><sup>4</sup> And they all answered him and said: 'Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing.'</p>

		                <p><sup>5</sup> Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it.</p>

		                <p><sup>6</sup> And they were in all two hundred; who descended in the days of Jared on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it.</p> 

		                <p><sup>7</sup> And these are the names of their leaders: Samlazaz, their leader, Araklba, Rameel, Kokablel, Tamlel, Ramlel, Danel, Ezeqeel, Baraqijal, Asael, Armaros, Batarel, Ananel, Zaq1el, Samsapeel, Satarel, Turel, Jomjael, Sariel. These are their chiefs of tens.</p>
                    
                    
        <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And all the others together with them took unto themselves wives, and each chose for himself one, and they began to go in unto them and to defile themselves with them, and they taught them charms and enchantments, and the cutting of roots, and made them acquainted with plants.</p>

		                <p><sup>2</sup> And they became pregnant, and they bare great giants, whose height was three thousand ells: Who consumed all the acquisitions of men.</p>

                    <p><sup>3</sup> And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and devoured mankind. And they began to sin against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another's flesh, and drink the blood.</p> 

		                <p><sup>4</sup> Then the earth laid accusation against the lawless ones.</p>
                    
                    
        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And Azazel taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all colouring tinctures.</p>

		                <p><sup>2</sup> And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray, and  became corrupt in all their ways.</p>
                   
		                <p><sup>3</sup> Semjaza taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, 'Armaros the resolving of enchantments, Baraqijal  (taught) astrology, Kokabel the constellations, Ezeqeel the knowledge of the clouds, Araqiel the signs of the earth, Shamsiel the signs of the sun, and Sariel the course of the moon.</p>

		                <p><sup>4</sup> And as men perished, they cried, and their cry went up to heaven.</p>
                    
                    
        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And then Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel looked down from heaven and saw much blood being shed upon the earth, and all lawlessness being wrought upon the earth.</p>

		                <p><sup>2</sup> And they said to one another: 'The earth made without inhabitant cries the voice of their
                    cryingst up to the gates of heaven.</p>

		                <p><sup>3</sup> And now to you, the holy ones of heaven, the souls of men make their suit, saying, &quot;Bring our cause before the Most High.&quot;</p> 
		
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And they said to the Lord of the ages: 'Lord of lords, God of gods, King of kings, and God of the ages, the throne of Thy glory (standeth) unto all the generations of the ages, and Thy name holy and glorious and blessed unto all the ages!</p> 

		                <p><sup>5</sup> Thou hast made all things, and power over all things hast Thou: and all things are naked and open in Thy sight, and Thou seest all things, and nothing can hide itself from Thee.</p> 

		                <p><sup>6</sup> Thou seest what Azazel hath done, who hath taught all unrighteousness on earth and revealed the eternal secrets which were (preserved) in heaven, which men were striving to learn: And Semjaza, to whom Thou hast given authority to bear rule over his associates.</p> 

		                <p><sup>7</sup> And they have gone to the daughters of men upon the earth, and have slept with the women, and have defiled themselves, and revealed to them all kinds of sins.</p> 

		                <p><sup>8</sup> And the women have borne giants, and the whole earth has thereby been filled with blood and unrighteousness.</p> 

		                <p><sup>9</sup> And now, behold, the souls of those who have died are crying and making their suit to the gates of heaven, and their lamentations have ascended: and cannot cease because of the lawless deeds which are wrought on the earth.</p> 

		                <p><sup>10</sup> And Thou knowest all things before they come to pass, and Thou seest these things and Thou dost suffer them, and Thou dost not say to us what we are to do to them in regard to these.</p>
                    
                    
       <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> Then said the Most High, the Holy and Great One spake, and sent Uriel to the son of Lamech, and said to him: Go to Noah and tell him in my name &quot;Hide thyself!&quot; and reveal to him the end that is approaching: that the whole earth will be destroyed, and a deluge is about to come upon the whole earth, and will destroy all that is on it.</p> 

		                <p><sup>2</sup> And now instruct him that he may escape and his seed may be preserved for all the generations of the world.</p> 

		                <p><sup>3</sup> And again the Lord said to Raphael: Bind Azazel hand and foot, and cast him into the darkness: and make an opening in the desert, which is in Dudael, and cast him therein.</p> 

		                <p><sup>4</sup> And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there for ever, and cover his face that he may,not see light.  And on the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the fire.</p>

		                <p><sup>5</sup> And heal the earth which the angels have corrupted, and proclaim the healing of the earth, that they may heal the plague, and that all the children of men may not perish through all the secret things that the Watchers
                    have disclosed and have taught their sons.</p>

		                <p><sup>6</sup> And the whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azazel: to him ascribe all sin.</p>

		                <p><sup>7</sup> And to Gabriel said the Lord: Proceed against the bastards and the reprobates, and against the children of fornication: and destroy [the children of fornication and] the children of the Watchers from amongst men [and cause them to go forth]: send them one against the other that they may destroy each other in battle: for length of days shall they not have.</p> 

		                <p><sup>8</sup> And no request that they (i.e. their fathers) make of thee shall be granted unto their fathers on
                    their behalf; for they hope to live an eternal life, and that each one of them will live five hundred years.</p>

		                <p><sup>9</sup> And the Lord said unto Michael: Go, bind Semjaza and his associates who have united themselves with women so as to have defiled themselves with them in all their uncleanness.</p> 

		                <p><sup>10</sup> And when their sons have slain one another, and they have seen the destruction of their beloved ones, bind them fast for seventy generations in the valleys of the earth, till the day of their judgement and of their consummation, till the judgement that is for ever and ever is consummated.</p> 

		                <p><sup>11</sup> In those days they shall be led off to the abyss of fire: and to the torment and the prison in which they shall be confined for ever.</p> 

		                <p><sup>12</sup> And whosoever shall be condemned and destroyed will from thenceforth be bound together with them to the end of all generations.</p>  

		                <p><sup>13</sup> And destroy all the spirits of the reprobate and the children of the Watchers, because they have wronged mankind.</p>

                    <p><sup>14</sup> Destroy all wrong from the face of the earth and let every evil work come to an end: and let the plant of righteousness and truth appear: and it shall prove a blessing; the works of righteousness and truth shall be planted in truth and joy for evermore.</p>
                    
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And then shall all the righteous escape, <br>
                    And shall live till they beget thousands of children, <br>
                    And all the days of their youth and their old age <br>

                    <p><sup>3</sup> And I Enoch was blessing the Lord of majesty and the King of the ages, and lo! the Watchers called me -Enoch the scribe- and said to me: 'Enoch, thou scribe of righteousness, go, declare to the Watchers of the heaven who have left the high heaven, the holy eternal place, and have defiled themselves with women, and have done as the children of earth do, and have taken unto themselves wives: &quot;Ye have wrought great destruction on the earth: And ye shall have no peace nor forgiveness of sin: and inasmuch as they delight themselves in their children, The murder of their beloved ones shall they see, and over the destruction of their children shall they lament, and shall make supplication unto eternity, but mercy and peace shall ye not attain.&quot;</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And Enoch went and said: Azazel, thou shalt have no peace: a severe sentence has gone forth against thee to put thee in bonds: And thou shalt not have toleration nor request granted to thee, because of the  unrighteousness which thou hast taught, and because of all the works of godlessness and unrighteousness and sin which thou hast shown to men.</p> 

		                <p><sup>2</sup> Then I went and spoke to them all together, and they were all afraid, and fear and trembling seized them. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>3</sup>
                    And they besought me to draw up a petition for them that they might find forgiveness, and to read their petition in the presence of the Lord of heaven.</p>

                    <p><sup>4</sup> For from thenceforward they could not speak (with Him) nor lift up their eyes to heaven for shame of their sins for which they had been condemned.</p> 

		                <p><sup>5</sup> Then I wrote out their petition, and the prayer in regard to their spirits and their deeds  individually and in regard to their requests that they should have forgiveness and length.</p>

		                <p><sup>6</sup> And I went off and sat down at the waters of Dan, in the land of Dan, to the south of the west of Hermon: I read their petition till I fell asleep.</p>

		                <p><sup>7</sup> And behold a dream came to me, and visions fell down upon me, and I saw visions of chastisement, and a voice came bidding (me) I to tell it to the sons of heaven, and reprimand them.</p>

		                <p><sup>8</sup> And when I awaked, I came unto them, and they were all sitting gathered together, weeping in Abelsjail, which is between Lebanon and Seneser, with their faces covered.</p>

		                <p><sup>9</sup> And I recounted before them all the visions which I had seen in sleep, and I began to speak the words of righteousness, and to reprimand the heavenly Watchers.</p>

                    <p><sup>2</sup> I saw in my sleep what I will now say with a tongue of flesh and with the breath of my mouth: which the
                    Great One has given to men to converse therewith and understand with the heart.</p> 

                    <p><sup>3</sup> As He has created and given to man the power of understanding the word of wisdom, so hath He created me also and given me the power of reprimanding the Watchers, the children of heaven.</p> 

		                <p><sup>4</sup> I wrote out your petition, and in my vision it appeared thus, that your petition will not be granted unto you throughout all the days of eternity, and that judgement has been finally passed upon you: yea (your petition) will not be granted unto you.</p>
 
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And from henceforth you shall not ascend into heaven unto all eternity, and in bonds of the earth the decree has gone forth to bind you for all the days of the world.</p> 
                    
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And (that) previously you shall have seen the destruction of your beloved sons and ye shall have no
                    pleasure in them, but they shall fall before you by the sword.</p>
 
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And your petition on their behalf shall not be granted, nor yet on your own: even though you weep and pray and speak all the words contained in the writing which I have written.</p>
 
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And the vision was shown to me thus: Behold, in the vision clouds invited me and a mist summoned me,  and the course of the stars and the lightnings sped and hastened me, and the winds in the vision caused me to fly and lifted me upward, and bore me into heaven.</p> 
		 
		                <p><sup>9</sup> And I went in till I drew nigh to a wall which is built of crystals and surrounded by tongues of fire: and it began to affright me.</p> 

		                <p><sup>10</sup> And I went into the tongues of fire and drew nigh to a large house which was built of crystals: and the walls of the house were like a tesselated floor (made) of crystals, and its groundwork was of crystal.</p>
		
		                <p><sup>11</sup> Its ceiling was like the path of the stars and the lightnings, and between them were fiery cherubim, and their heaven was (clear as) water. A flaming fire surrounded the walls, and its portals blazed with fire.</p> 
		
		                <p><sup>12</sup> And I entered into that house, and it was hot as fire and cold as ice: there were no delights of life therein: fear covered me, and trembling got hold upon me. And as I quaked and trembled, I fell upon my face.</p> 

		                <p><sup>13</sup> And I beheld a vision, And lo! there was a second house, greater than the former, and the entire portal stood open before me, and it was built of flames of fire.</p>

		                <p><sup>14</sup> And in every respect it so excelled in splendour and magnificence and extent that I cannot describe to you its splendour and its extent.</p> 
                    
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And its floor was of fire, and above it were lightnings and the path of the stars, and its ceiling also was flaming fire.</p> 

		                <p><sup>16</sup> And I looked and saw therein a lofty throne: its appearance was as crystal, and the wheels thereof as the shining sun, and there was the vision of cherubim.</p> 

		                <p><sup>17</sup> And from underneath the throne came streams of flaming fire so that I could not look thereon. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>18</sup> And the Great Glory sat thereon, and His raiment shone more brightly than the sun and was whiter than any snow.</p> 

		                <p><sup>19</sup> None of the angels could enter and could behold His face by reason of the magnificence and glory and no flesh could behold Him. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>20</sup> The flaming fire was round about Him, and a great fire stood before Him, and none around could draw nigh Him: ten thousand times ten thousand (stood) before Him, yet He needed no counselor.</p> 

		                <p><sup>21</sup> And the most holy ones who were nigh to Him did not leave by night nor depart from Him.</p> 
                    
                    <p><sup>22</sup> And until then I had been prostrate on my face, trembling: and the Lord called me with His own mouth, and said to me: ' Come hither, Enoch, and hear my word.'</p> 
                      
                    <p><sup>23</sup> And one of the holy ones came to me and waked me, and He made me rise up and approach the
                    door: and I bowed my face downwards.</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And He answered and said to me, and I heard His voice: 'Fear not, Enoch, thou righteous man and scribe of righteousness: approach hither and hear my voice. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And go, say to the Watchers of heaven, who have sent thee to intercede for them: &quot;You should
                    intercede&quot; for men, and not men for you: </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>3</sup> Wherefore have ye left the high, holy, and eternal heaven, and lain with women, and defiled yourselves with the daughters of men and taken to yourselves wives, and done like the children of earth, and begotten giants (as
                    your) sons? And though ye were holy, spiritual, living the eternal life, you have defiled yourselves with the blood of women, and have begotten (children) with the blood of flesh, and, as the children of men, have lusted after flesh and blood as those also do who die and perish.</p> 

		                <p><sup>4</sup> Therefore have I given them wives also that they might impregnate them, and beget children by them, that thus nothing might be wanting to them on earth.</p>
 
                    <p><sup>5</sup> But you were formerly spiritual, living the eternal life, and immortal for all generations of the world. And therefore I have not appointed wives for you; for as for the spiritual ones of the heaven, in heaven is their dwelling.</p>

 		                <p><sup>6</sup> And now, the giants, who are produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling.</p> 

		                <p><sup>7</sup> Evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from men and from the holy Watchers is their beginning and primal origin; they shall be evil spirits on earth, and evil spirits shall they be called.</p> 


                    <p><sup>8</sup> [As for the spirits of heaven, in heaven shall be their dwelling, but as for the spirits of the earth which were born upon the earth, on the earth shall be their dwelling.]</p> 
		
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And the spirits of the giants afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destruction on the earth, and cause trouble: they take no food, but nevertheless hunger and thirst, and cause
                    offences.</p> 
		     
		                <p><sup>10</sup> And these spirits shall rise up against the children of men and against the women, because they have proceeded from them.</p>

		                <p><sup>2</sup> And now as to the watchers who have sent thee to intercede for them, who had been aforetime in heaven, (say to them): &quot;You have been in heaven, but all the mysteries had not yet been revealed to you, and you knew worthless ones, and these in the hardness of your hearts you have made known to the women, and through these mysteries women and men work much evil on earth.&quot; Say to them therefore: &quot; You

                    <p><sup>3</sup> And I saw the places of the luminaries and the treasuries of the stars and of the thunder and in the uttermost depths, where were a fiery bow and arrows and their quiver, and a fiery sword and all the lightnings.</p> 

		                <p><sup>4</sup> And they took me to the living waters, and to the fire of the west, which receives every setting of the sun. And I came to a river of fire in which the fire flows like water and discharges itself into the great sea towards the west.</p>
 
                    <p><sup>5</sup> I saw the great rivers and came to the great river and to the great darkness, and went to the place where no flesh walks.</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> I saw the treasuries of all the winds: I saw how He had furnished with them the whole creation and the firm foundations of the earth.</p>

		                <p><sup>2</sup> And I saw the corner-stone of the earth: I saw the four winds which bear [the earth and] the firmament of the heaven. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And I saw how the winds stretch out the vaults of heaven, and have their station between heaven and
                    earth: these are the pillars of the heaven.</p> 

		                <p><sup>4</sup> I saw the winds of heaven which turn and bring the circumference of the sun and all the stars to their setting. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>5</sup> I saw the winds on the earth carrying the clouds: I saw the paths of the angels.</p>

                    <p><sup>7</sup> And I proceeded and saw a place which burns day and night, where there are seven mountains of magnificent stones, three towards the east, and three towards the south.</p> 

		                <p><sup>8</sup> And as for those towards the east, was of coloured stone, and one of pearl, and one of jacinth, and those towards the south of red stone.</p> 

                    <p><sup>9</sup> But the middle one reached to heaven like the throne of God, of alabaster, and the summit of the throne was of sapphire. And I saw a flaming fire. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And beyond these mountains is a region the end of the great earth: there the heavens were completed.</p>

                    <p><sup>11</sup> And I saw a deep abyss, with columns of heavenly fire, and among them I saw columns of fire fall, which were beyond measure alike towards the height and towards the depth. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>12</sup> And beyond that abyss I saw a place which had no firmament of the heaven above, and no firmly founded

		                <p><sup>14</sup> And the stars which roll over the fire are they which have transgressed the commandment of the Lord in the beginning of their rising, because they did not come forth at their appointed times.</p>

                    <p><sup>9</sup> and I saw a horrible thing: a great fire there which burnt and blazed, and the place was cleft as far as the abyss, being full of great descending columns of fire: neither its extent or magnitude could I see, nor could I conjecture.</p>

                    <p><sup>10</sup> Then I said: 'How fearful is the place and how terrible to look upon!'</p> 
                    
                    <p><sup>11</sup> Then Uriel answered me, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said unto me: 'Enoch, why hast
                    thou such fear and affright?'</p> 

		                <p><sup>12</sup> And I answered: 'Because of this fearful place, and because of the spectacle of the pain.' And he said unto me: </p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And thence I went to another place, and the mountain [and] of hard rock.</p> 

                    <p><sup>2</sup> And there was in it four hollow places, deep and wide and very smooth. How smooth are the hollow places and deep and dark to look at.</p> 

		                <p><sup>3</sup> Then Raphael answered, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said unto me: </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>4</sup>
                    'These hollow places have been created for this very purpose, that the spirits of the souls of the dead should assemble therein, yea that all the souls of the children of men should assemble here. </p>

		                <p><sup>6</sup> I saw (the spirit of) a dead man making suit, and his voice went forth to heaven and made suit. And I asked Raphael the angel who was with me, and I said unto him:</p> 
                    
                    <p><sup>7</sup> 'This spirit which maketh suit, whose is it, whose voice goeth forth and maketh suit to heaven ?'</p> 
 
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And he answered me saying: 'This is the spirit which went forth from Abel, whom his brother Cain slew, and he makes his suit against him till his seed is destroyed from the face of the earth, and his seed is annihilated from amongst the seed of men.'</p> 

		                <p><sup>9</sup> Then I asked regarding it, and regarding all the hollow places: 'Why is one separated from the other?'</p> 

                    <p><sup>10</sup> And he answered me and said unto me: 'These three have been made that the spirits of the dead might be

		                <p><sup>3</sup> And he answered saying: 'This high mountain which thou hast seen, whose summit is like the throne of God, is His throne, where the Holy Great One, the Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, will sit, when He shall come down to visit the earth with goodness.</p>
