        <!-------------------------------START OF LESSON 1  ------------------------------->
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
              
                <p><sup>1</sup>Then when Terah was two hundred and thirty years old, he fell sick, and called Abraham' his son,^ and said unto him, " my son, I wish to die."</p>
                <p><sup>2</sup>But Abraham stood up and comforted him, paid him all due honour, and did not aggrieve him about his being a maker of idols.</p>
                <p><sup>3</sup>For Abraham his son, was a righteous man, and could not bear idols ;^ but he paid him all due respect, as being his father.</p>
                <p><sup>4</sup>Then Terah died ; and Abraham and Nahor buried him in a mountain.</p>
                <p><sup>5</sup>But when Abraham was grown up, God said unto him, " Abraham, come out of thy land, of thy kindred and of thy father's house, and go to the land that I will show thee."</p>
                <p><sup>6</sup>Then Abraham arose, and took Sarah his wife, and Lot his brother's son,* and they came to the land of the Amorites.</p>
                <p><sup>7</sup>And Abraham was seventy years old when he saw this vision;</p>
                <p><sup>8</sup>and this was his first wandering from the land of the east, to the western side of the river Euphrates. So Abraham came, and dwelt among kings; and those kings rose up against his brother's son, and carried him away captive.</p>
                <p><sup>9</sup>Then Abraham took his servants, and all those whowere about him, and came to his brother's son, and delivered him out of their hands.</p>
                <p><sup>10</sup>At that time Abraham was eighty years old, and no son was born to him, because that Sarah his wife, was barren.</p>
                <p><sup>11</sup>Then as he was returning from the war with those kings, the grace of God drew him, until he had passed over the hill of Nablus j and from the hill of Nablus, he came near to Jerusalem, ere it was built.</p>
                <p><sup>12</sup>Then Melchizedec, priest of the Most High God, came out, and welcomed him with joy. And Abraham, when he saw Melchizedec, made haste and bowed to him in worship, and kissed him on the face ; and M^elchizedec gave him a good blessing.</p>
                <p><sup>13</sup>Then Abraham gave Melchizedec a tenth of all he had with him.</p>
                <p><sup>14</sup>After that Abraham communed with Melchizedec of the holy mysteries which Melchizedec had consecrated with his own hand.</p>
                <p><sup>15</sup>For that was an exalted place, not by man's hand, but God Himself had anointed it.</p>
                <p><sup>16</sup>But after Abraham had communed with Melchizedec, Godsaid unto Abraham, " Fear not, great is thy reward with Me;</p>
                <p><sup>17</sup>and in like manner as Melchizedec My high priest blessed thee, and made thee partaker with himself of Holy Mysteries, so will I make thee partaker with him of heavenly grace."</p>
                <p><sup>18</sup>Again did God say to Abraham, " In blessing will I bless thee, and in multiplying will I multiply thy seed upon the face of the earth."</p>
                


        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

                <p><sup>1</sup>After this there was a famine in the land of Palestine ; and Abraham went down into the land of Egypt.</p>
                <p><sup>2</sup>And Sarah his wife was with him, and she was good-looking. So Abraham said to her, " Say not, I am Abraham's wife, lest they kill me, and take thee from me.</p>
                <p><sup>3</sup>But say, I am his sister.^' Then when they came into the land of Egypt,^ men spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and said to him, " Behold a man has come hither ; and with him is his beautiful sister." Then Pharaoh sent and took her from Abraham, who remained weeping.</p>
                <p><sup>4</sup>But God in His mercy sent an angel who smote Pharaoh, and said to him, " Send back to Abraham his wife,  lest God kill thee."</p>
                <p><sup>5</sup>Then in the morning, Pharaoh called Abraham, and said unto him, " Forgive me." He then gave him his wife Sarah ; and gave to Sarah, Hagar the Egyptian, and gave her many presents.</p>
                <p><sup>6</sup>After this Abraham took Sarah his wife, with Hagar her maid-servant, and returned to Palestine. And after that, Abraham took to himself Hagar to wife, who bare him Ishmael, when Abraham was eighty-seven years old.</p>
                <p><sup>7</sup>But in that Abraham said, " Sarah is my sister," he did not lie ; inasmuch as Terah, his father, married two wives ; one of which was called Tona,t the mother of Abraham, who died shortly after he was born.</p>
                <p><sup>8</sup>Then Terah married again another wife whose name was Tahdif, who bare him Sarah, whom Abraham married, and who, for that reason, said, " She is my sister "—on my father's side, but not on my mother's.</p>
                <p><sup>9</sup>After this, when Abraham was dwelling in tents, the Lordcame to him with angels of His, and gave him a sign of the birth of his son Isaac,'' who was born to him when he was ahundred years old.</p>
                <p><sup>10</sup>The Lord showed him also many mysteries. Then days after this, God said to Abraham, when Isaac wasfourteen years old, ' Offer unto me thy son Isaac, in oblation."</p>
                <p><sup>11</sup>Then Abraham fortified himself and took courage for this trial ; and brought his son to offer him in oblation to God.</p>
                <p><sup>12</sup>But God redeemed Isaac with a lamb that was tied to a bush.</p>
                <p><sup>13</sup>And the bush to which the lamb was tied, is the very place into which the tree of the Cross was planted.</p>
                <p><sup>14</sup>And the lamb that saved Isaac from death, was a figure of the Lamb of Godwho saved us all from death.</p>
                <p><sup>15</sup>That mountain also, on which king David saw an angelstanding with a sharp sword of fire in his hand, as if going to smite Jerusalem with it—is the place where Abraham saw withthe eye of the Holy Ghost, the Son of God, hanging on it. For this reason did the Lord say to the Jews, '' Abraham,your father, rejoiced and longed to see my day, and he did see it, and was glad."</p>
                <p><sup>16</sup>Again, this is the place, as the blessed Paul said, " For the sake of Jesus Christ my Lord am I minister of the circumcision "—where Christ was circumcised on the eighth day.</p>
                <p><sup>17</sup>That is also the place where the patriarch Abraham offered up an oblation to God.</p>
                <p><sup>18</sup>And again, as it was in the days of Moses, when they offered up a lamb for the sins of the people, to  cleanse them from their sins—so also did the Lamb of God offer up Himself in oblation for us, to set us free from our sins.</p>

                

        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>

                <p><sup>1</sup>After this, Melchizedec showed himself to men, who saw him, and who were comforted by his words, everywhere.</p>
                <p><sup>2</sup>The kings of the earth and peoples, when they heard his voice, did gather together; a multitude of creatures and of kings; that numbered twelve hosts. </p>
                <p><sup>3</sup>They came to him and bowed to him in worship, and were blessed by him, and asked him, saying, " Come, let us make thee king over us.'</p>
                <p><sup>4</sup>' But Melchizedec king of Salem, and priest of the Most High God, would not.</p>
                <p><sup>5</sup>And the kings wondered at his beauty; their hearts were drawn to him by his discourse, and they fell down at his feet in worship ; and they asked God, that Melchizedec might dwell among them in their palaces.</p>
                <p><sup>6</sup>But Melchizedec would not, and said unto them, " I cannot leave this place, and go to another one.''</p>
                <p><sup>7</sup>So those kings said among themselves, " Let every one of us who can, come, and let us build a city on this mountain for Melchizedec."</p>
                <p><sup>8</sup>They all took pleasure in the work, brought together materials in abundance, and built the City of Jerusalem, that means " the middle of the earth."</p>
                <p><sup>9</sup>Then Melchizedec continued to dwell in it, at that place; and the kings came, and were blessed by him, until the day of his departure, when his life ended in this world.</p>
                
                  

        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>            
                
                <p><sup>1</sup>After this, Abraham ordered one of his servants, to take a wife for his son Isaac ; and adjured him not to marry Isaac, but to one of his own kindred.</p>
                <p><sup>2</sup>And Abraham entered into rest when one hundred and seventy-five years old ; and Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him.</p>
                <p><sup>3</sup>Then Isaac married when he was forty years old ; and Esau and Jacob his sons, were bom unto him when he was about sixty years of age.</p>
                <p><sup>4</sup>And God blessed Isaac greatly. Then after this Jacob went to the land of Haran, to Laban, his mother's brother, and married his two daughters Leah and Eachel.</p>
                <p><sup>5</sup>He had by Leah, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun ; and by Rachel he had Joseph and Benjamin.</p>
                <p><sup>6</sup>Then he had also by Zilpah, Leah's maid-servant. Gad and Aser ; and by Bilhah, Rachel's maid-servant, he had Dan and Naphtali.</p>
                <p><sup>7</sup>And about twenty years after Jacob's return from the land of Haran, before his father Isaac died, Joseph was sold by his brothers, because they were jealous of him.</p>
                <p><sup>8</sup>But when Isaac died, his two sons Esau and Jacob came to him, embalmed him, and laid him in the sepulchre of his father. </p>
                <p><sup>9</sup>Then six years after the death of Isaac, Rebecca died ; and they buried her by Sarah, Abraham's wife. And when, after that Leah, Jacob's wife died, they buried her by the side of them.</p>
                <p><sup>10</sup>Then after this Judah took to himself a wife whose namewas Habwadiya, that means, " house-wife j"t but in the law her name is Sewa.</p>
                <p><sup>11</sup>She was of a Canaanitish family, and Jacob's heart suffered much on that account ; and he said to Judah his son who had married that wife, " The God of Abraham and of Isaac will not allow the seed of this Canaanitish woman to mingle with my seed</p>
                <p><sup>12</sup>But some days after this, Sewa bare three sons unto Judah, whose names were Er, Onan, and Selah.</p>
                <p><sup>13</sup>And when Er was grown up, Judah married him, his first-born son, unto a woman named Tamar, daughter of Kadesh Levi.</p>
                <p><sup>14</sup>And Er continued with her a long time, and behaved after the manner of the men of Sodom and Gomorrah. </p>
                <p><sup>15</sup>But God looked down upon his evil deeds and killed him.</p>
                <p><sup>16</sup>Then Judah married his son Onan to Tamar, saying, " He shall raise seed unto his brother."</p>
                <p><sup>17</sup>But him also did God kill because of his evil deeds ; on account of Jacob's curse, " </p>
                <p><sup>18</sup>That no Canaanitish seed should mingle with his own."</p>
                <p><sup>19</sup>So God would not let any of it mingle with that of Jacob the righteous.</p>
                <p><sup>20</sup>Therefore did Tamar go to Judah her father-in-law, who had intercourse with her, not knowing she was his son's wife; and she bare unto him twins, Pharez and Zarah.</p>

        
                    
        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
                <p><sup>1</sup>After this Jacob went to Joseph, and continued fourteen years in the land of Egypt, where he died at the age of one hundred and fifty-seven; when the good Joseph was fiftythree years old. </p>
                <p><sup>2</sup>Then when he was dead, Joseph called cunning Egyptian embalmers, who embalmed him beautifully ; and then Joseph carried his body to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the sepulchre of his fathers Abraham and Isaac. </p>
                <p><sup>3</sup>After this Pharez begat Judah, and Judah begat Ezrom, and Ezrom begat Aram ; and Aram begat Aminadab ; and Aminadab begat Naasson.</p>
                <p><sup>4</sup>And this Naasson was great among the sons of Judah ; and the daughter of Aminadab married Eleazar the son of Aaron, who prayed to God, until His wrath abated.</p>
                <p><sup>5</sup>Thus, my son, have I told thee in detail the genealogies from the first until now.</p>
