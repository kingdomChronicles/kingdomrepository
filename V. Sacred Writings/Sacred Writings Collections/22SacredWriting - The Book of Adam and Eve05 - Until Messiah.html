        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p><sup>1</sup>After this Jacob went to Joseph, and continued fourteen years in the land of Egypt, where he died at the age of one hundred and fifty-seven; when the good Joseph was fifty-three years old. </p>
        <p><sup>2</sup>Then when he was dead, Joseph called cunning Egyptian embalmers, who embalmed him beautifully ; and then Joseph carried his body to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the sepulchre of his fathers Abraham and Isaac. </p>
        <p><sup>3</sup>After this Judah begat Pharez, and Pharez begat Ezrom, and Ezrom begat Aram ; and Aram begat Aminadab ; and Aminadab begat Naasson.</p>
        <p><sup>4</sup>And this Naasson was great among the sons of Judah; and the daughter of Aminadab married Eleazar the son of Aaron, who prayed to God, until His wrath abated.</p>
        <p><sup>5</sup>Thus, my son, have I told thee in detail the genealogies from the first until now.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
              
    
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> After this, there began to issue a race from Naasson, who was great among the sons of Judah; and from him began a kingdom and a priesthood, and the Jews became celebrated through him. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> Then Naasson begat Salmon, and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab. And thou must know that from Boaz and Ruth the Moabitess, began the kingdom whereby Lot, the son of Abraham's brother, obtained a share [in the generations] of the kingdom [of Judah]. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> For God denied not seed to Lot, neither would He cut it short. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> For this Lot was righteous, and shared all Abraham's troubles with him ; and received the angels of God in Sodom and Gomorrah. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> Therefore did God give to Lot's children fellowship in the kingdom, and that was [reckoned] for righteousness unto Lot the righteous. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> For this reason also were [Lot's children] mentioned among the genealogies of the kingdom of Abraham and of Lot; for Christ was born of their seed. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> Then, again, Obed, Ruth's son, was of Lot's seed, on his mother's [side] ; and Obed begat Jesse ; and Jesse begat David the king. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And king David begat Solomon; all these are of Ruth the Moabitess. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> Again, Amnan, the daughter of [Dan] , king of the Ammonites, was of Lot's seed ; and Solomon the king took this daughter of Dan to wife and had by her, Rehoboam, who reigned after Solomon. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> But king Solomon took to himself many wives, seven hundred daughters of kings, three hundred concubines, one thousand in number. <br>
        <sup>11</sup> But although Solomon took to himself these many wives, they did not bare him a single male child, but Rehoboam, of Amnan, the daughter of Dan, king of Ammon ; who was of a blessed race.  <br>
        <sup>12</sup> Thus, again, God would not allow the seed of Canaanites to mingle with that of strange peoples, which God had made strangers.  <br>
        <sup>13</sup> And this shows that Christ came of the seed of Abraham the blessed father, and of Lot his brother's son.  <br>
        <sup>14</sup> And all the families of the children of Israel in the land of Egypt, were Levi, Amram, Moses, Joshua, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh ; all these were great chiefs over their peoples.</p><br>


        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> As to Moses, when they had thrown him into the river, Sephurah, the daughter of Pharaoh, took him up thence, and brought him up. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> She it is, whom the Hebrews call Mariam, the mother of Moses. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And Moses abode forty years in Pharaoh's house ; and other forty years in the land of Midian, ere God spake to him. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> Then, again, when God spake to Moses from within the bush his tongue faltered ; and [his] tongue wasâ€”as God said, " From the time that I spake to My servant Moses, he was of a faltering tongue.''<br>
        <sup>5</sup> And Moses dwelt forty years in the land of Egypt, and forty years in the land of Midian, with the priest Jethro, his father- in-law ; then forty years more in the wilderness ; when Moses died, aged one hundred and twenty years. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> Then after him arose Joshua, the son of Nun. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> He was twenty-seven years judge over the children of Israel, and exercised judgment over them ; he was prophet among them, and kept them, and led them in the right way and he entered into rest and died, when sixty years old. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> Then after him arose Kusarat the judge, eight years, and he died ; and after him Phutamiral, the son of Kaba, judged the
        children of Israel forty years, and died. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> After him Naod, son of Phuru, judged the children of Israel eighty years. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> But in the twenty-fifth year of Naod, ended four thousand years since Adam. <br>
        <sup>11</sup> Naod died, and Sikar judged the children of Israel. <br>
        <sup>12</sup> But in his days a king of Canaan rose against Sikar, wishing to make war against him. <br>
        <sup>13</sup> But God gave Sikar victory over him, whom he defeated; and Sikar judged forty years. After him Yarod was judge over the people of Israel, forty years ; and after him Abimelec judged ten years, and died. <br>
        <sup>14</sup> And after him Banu, son of Yuorani, judged twenty-three years, and died. <br>
        <sup>15</sup> After him Yar of Phila, judged twenty-two years, and died. <br>
        <sup>16</sup> After him the son of Aminadab, judged fifty-eight years, and died. <br>
        <sup>17</sup> And after him the daughter of Nasyamu judged seven years, and died. <br>
        <sup>18</sup> After her, Ansyus judged seven years, and died ; and after him the Philistine judged forty years. <br>
        <sup>19</sup> But God gave him into the hands of the champion Samson, who slew him. <br>
        <sup>20</sup> Then the champion Samson arose and was judge over the children of Israel twenty years, and then died. <br>
        <sup>21</sup> Then the children of Israel were left without a judge twelve years, when Eli the priest began to judge ; and judged them forty years, and then died. <br>
        <sup>22</sup> After him Samuel was judge over the children of Israel forty years, and died. <br>
        <sup>23</sup> Then after him, Saul reigned over them forty years, and died. <br>
        <sup>24</sup> Then after him, David reigned over the children of Israel forty years, and then died. <br>
        <sup>25</sup> And after him, his son Solomon arose, who also reigned forty years over the children of Israel, and then died. <br>
        <sup>26</sup> He wrought more wonders in the earth than all other kings, who were before him. <br>
        <sup>27</sup> For he was the first whom God filled with wisdom. <br>
        <sup>28</sup> So that he made [and did] many things peculiar to him ; so far as to make a ship, and go in it to the city of Ophir; [where] he wrought gold in ornaments, and brought it to Jerusalem. <br>
        <sup>29</sup> During his reign, there was great peace ; there was no trouble ; but there was peace between him and Hiram king of Tyre; who reigned five hundred years over the city of Tyre, and whose kingdom lasted from the reign of Solomon, to that of Zedekiah ; until, from the length of his days and of his years, and from the greatness of his kingdom, he exalted himself and said, " I am God, and no man."' <br>
        <sup>30</sup> God was wroth against him because of his evil deed; and God looked down upon it, and delivered him into the hands of king Nebuchadnezzar who put him to death; removed his army, and took his spoil.</p><br>

        

        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> But we will inform thee of the things king Solomon gave every day in his house. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> On account of his many wives, they made bread in his house of thirty cores of fine flour; one hundred cores of wheat flour, which hardly sufficed. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And they slaughtered in his house daily, ten bullocks well-fatted, and twenty fat oxen, and one hundred sheep; besides what they slew of buffaloes, gazelles and wild deer, which they hunted every day. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And in Solomon's house they drank daily four hundred basins of wine. And many other things did they. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And Solomon reigned over his large kingdom with the greatest wisdom ever found. But he did not keep his soul; but inclined his heart to the love of women, and forsook God who had created him, and who had given him this kingdom. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And he died in his denial of Him, and in his sins. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> After him reigned Rehoboam, his son, seventeen years, and did evil. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> He defiled Jerusalem with abominable sacrifices, and sacrificed to Satan; and adultery increased greatly in his days. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> Wherefore God cut off his kingdom swiftly ; and took it from the house of David. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> But in the fifth year of Rehoboam, a king whose name was Susakim came up against Jerusalem. <br>
        <sup>11</sup> He took all the spoil of the temple, and spoiled all Rehoboam had, and spoiled all the house of David, and removed them and took them to his own country. <br>
        <sup>12</sup> And he boasted, and said to the Jews, " The things I have taken from you as spoil, are goods that belonged to my fathers, of which your fathers spoiled them, when they came out of the land of Egypt, and which they brought unto this place ; and behold, I have taken them from you." <br>
        <sup>13</sup> And Rehoboam died in his denial [of God] ; and after him, his son Abius, reigned twenty years over the children of Israel. <br>
        <sup>14</sup> But he, too, walked in his father's ways, by reason of Makia his mother, the daughter of Absalom; wherefore, did he many wicked things, and then died. <br>
        <sup>15</sup> After him arose Asaph his son, who reigned forty-one years over the children of Israel. He did what was right, just and good before God; he brake down the idols that were in his day, and removed their images from the face of the land; and he took his wicked mother Anna, and threw her down from the roof [of her house] and she died, because of her adulteries. <br>
        <sup>16</sup> After that, came Eleazar a black king, who was king of Endena, to fight Asaph. <br>
        <sup>17</sup> But God delivered him into the hands of Asaph, who defeated him. <br>
        <sup>18</sup> Then Asaph died ; and his son Jehoshaphat reigned in his stead. <br>
        <sup>19</sup> He also did that which is just and good before God, and pleased God all his days, and then died. <br>
        <sup>20</sup> Then his son Aram reigned in his stead; but he transgressed the commandments of God, and forsook His law, and sacrificed unto idols. <br>
        <sup>21</sup> Then Zambri rose up against him, made war against him, and he died in his denial [of God]. <br>
        <sup>22</sup> Then Yusia, his son, reigned [after him]; but on account of his transgressions, God delivered him into the hands of his enemies, who put him to death. <br>
        <sup>23</sup> But when he was dead, his mother rose up against all the royal children and put them to death, and said, " I will take the kingdom from the house of David."<br>
        <sup>24</sup> Then Yusabet daughter of the king of Aram, arose, took Agragarina, and slew him before the eyes of the royal children that were left. <br>
        <sup>25</sup> But when she had put him to death, she feared, and hid herself and those with her, under a bed. <br>
        <sup>26</sup> And Gotholia was queen over the children of Israel, and died. <br>
        <sup>27</sup> Then the whole people of Israel said, " Whom shall we make king over us. <br>
        <sup>28</sup> Then when Yuda the high priest heard they spake thus, he gathered together the whole of the Jews within the Temple, and waited until the messengers of thousands and the messengers of hundreds came; and then Yuda the high priest, said to them, " What do you require of me, and who is he whom ye will make king over the house of David?" <br>
        <sup>29</sup> Then they said to him, " Thou hast authority." <br>
        <sup>30</sup> Then Yuda rose and took Barsia, and brought him before them, and said to them, " Does this one suit you for a king. The people were pleased with him ; so Yuda brought him into the house of God, and set him over the kingdom ; then all the people rejoiced, and the whole country was quiet in his days ; and he was king in Jerusalem forty years. <br>
        <sup>31</sup> But Barsia did not bear in mind all the good things Yuda the priest had told him; but he took him and put him to death. <br>
        <sup>32</sup> After this, enemies rose up against Barsia and put him also to death. </p><br>

        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> After him his son Araazias reigned twenty-nine years, and put to death those who had killed his father; but he did not put to death their children, so as to fulfil the law of Moses, that says," Ye shall not put to death children for the sins of their fathers." <br>
        <sup>2</sup> Then Amazias died, and after him Ozia reigned fifty-two years, and in his reign exercised justice and judgment, and right before God. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> Yet did he do one wicked act, and that was thatâ€”without due orders, he offered sacrifices unto God, and oblations that did not become him. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> So he died. After him Yonathan his son, reigned sixteen years. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> But during his reign, he did evil before God, and angered his Creator, and forsook His commandment and His law ; and burnt incense to idols, and sacrificed unto them. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> For this reason did God deliver him to death, into the hands of Caran, king of Elmosal. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And when the king of Elmosal led him away [captive] , he [Yonathan] took all the vessels he found in the house of God, and sent them all to the great king of Elmosal ; and left nothing in the house of God. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> In the days of this king, did the children of Israel, go the first time into captivity. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> He removed them to his own country, and the land of Israel remained bare. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> Then the king of Elmosal, sent people to dwell in the land and to till it, instead of the children of Israel who had left it. <br>
        <sup>11</sup> But when those people came to dwell in that land, [wild] beasts rent them asunder and devoured them, and prevailed against them in all the borders of the land. <br>
        <sup>12</sup> Then they sent word to the king in their own tongue, and asked him to send them Urias the priest, to give them the law, so that wild beasts should no longer come near them, and hurt them. <br>
        <sup>13</sup> When the king heard this he sent them Urias the priest, and commanded him to give them a law, for them to keep, so that the wild beasts hurt them not. <br>
        <sup>14</sup> Urias the priest came, and did as the king had commanded him, and he gave the people the law of the Jews ; it was in their hands, they recited it and ruled themselves after it. <br>
        <sup>15</sup> And those were the Samar; whom the king, of whom we have just spoken, had sent to till the land of Israel. <br>
        <sup>16</sup> Then Yunathan died, and after him reigned Akaz his son, who did well before God, and then died. <br>
        <sup>17</sup> After him reigned his son Hezekias, when he was twenty-five years old ; and he reigned twenty-two years ; and did good, and judgment, equity and justice ; and he pleased the Lord; he kept His law and His commandments ; he brake down the idols, and destroyed their houses. <br>
        <sup>18</sup> But in the fourth year of his reign, came Sanakreb king of Assarium, and took away captive all that were left and sent them to Babylon. <br>
        <sup>19</sup> But Hezekias served the Lord God, and fulfilled His law, until he fell sick and became very weak, and was in great distress by reason of his sickness ; his heart suffered, and he said to himself, " Woe is me ! I shall die without a son to reign after me." <br>
        <sup>20</sup> And in his sickness he wept before Grod and said, " Woe is me, Lord ! behold, I die without a son ; and behold the promise Thou madest unto David, shall fail in me ; and the kingdom shall pass from the house of David.'<br>
        <sup>21</sup> Then God looked upon his sorrow of heart, and upon his sickness, for his sickness was sore. <br>
        <sup>22</sup> And God had pity on him and gave him fifteen years over and above the rest of his days; and he recovered from his sickness. <br>
        <sup>23</sup> Then three years after he had recovered, and God had raised him from his sickness, he begat Manasseh. And he died, rejoicing greatly at having a son born unto him, to sit upon his throne.<br>
        <sup>24</sup> After him Manasseh his son reigned twelve years in Jerusalem. He did much evil, and made the people of Jerusalem worship idols. <br>
        <sup>25</sup> Then when he had thus transgressed the law of God, Isaias the prophet came to him and rebuked him for the wickednesses he had wrought.<br>
        <sup>26</sup> Then Manasseh was angry with him, and commanded valiant and wicked men to take Isaias the prophet, and to saw him asunder with a saw of wood, from his head down to his feet, among the trees of the wilderness; and then to cast him to the beasts [of the field] to devour him. <br>
        <sup>27</sup> And they did so to him. Isaias was then one hundred and twenty years old. <br>
        <sup>28</sup> His raiment was of shaggy goat's hair upon his body; and hefasted regularly every second day [of the week] all the days of his life. <br>
        <sup>29</sup> Then Manasseh died; and after him reigned his son Amots, who did evil before God; for he offered sons and daughters in sacrifice unto idols. <br>
        <sup>30</sup> Then Amots died; and after him reigned Yusias his son. <br>
        <sup>31</sup> He was twenty years old when he [began] to reign, and continued twenty-two years in his kingdom in the city of Jerusalem. <br>
        <sup>32</sup> He did justice and right before God; and kept the Passover of the Lord, such as the children of Israel never were able to keep, except the one Moses kept for them in the
        wilderness. <br>
        <sup>33</sup> This king purified Jerusalem of all wickedness. But Pharhon the lame, king of Egypt, killed Yusias in Carmelos.<br>
        <sup>34</sup> Then after him Akaz reigned three months. <br>
        <sup>35</sup> But Pharhon bound Akaz in chains and sent him into the land of Egypt; and he died in that place. <br>
        <sup>36</sup> After his death Yuakem his brother reigned fourteen years; but in the third year of his reign, Nabukadanatsor came to the city of Jerusalem, and God delivered Yuakem into his hands; and Yuakem was under his orders, bowed unto him, and paid him tribute; he then sickened and died. <br>
        <sup>37</sup> After him reigned his brother Yekonias three months ; then came Nabukadanatsor who took captive Yekonias and all his army, and sent them to Babylon. <br>
        <sup>38</sup> On the way thither, Daniel's mother gave him birth. Anania, Azaria, and Misael, sons of Yekonias, were also bom on the first transportation of Yuakem. Then Yekonias died, and after him Zedekias reigned twelve years. <br>
        <sup>39</sup> This was the end of kings that reigned over the children of Israel, and all Judah; after them no king was left to them. <br>
        <sup>40</sup> And at the end of the fourteenth year of Zedekias, Nabukadanatsor came and transported all the people of Jerusalem, as far as the west, and as far as the river Euphrates, and as far as the great river. <br>
        <sup>41</sup> He laid waste Tyre, and burnt Hiram king of Tyre with fire, who had reigned five hundred years. <br>
        <sup>42</sup> Then after this Nabukadanatsor went into Egypt, and put to death Pharhon; destroyed his army, and laid waste the land of Egypt; and then took the city of Jerusalem. <br>
        <sup>43</sup> And God delivered Zedekias into his hands, whom he took, and brought out before idols, and set him before the people, and slew his children before him, without pity. <br>
        <sup>44</sup> He then put out his eyes, bound his hands with chains and his feet with fetters; and sent him to Babylon, because of his folly, and of the evil he had done to Irmias the prophet, by casting him into springs of water in a marsh."<br>
        <sup>45</sup> After this Nabuzaradan captain of the king's array, destroyed the walls of Jerusalem, burnt the House of God with fire; and did all manner of evil to Jerusalem. <br>
        <sup>46</sup> But Simeon the priest, found favour and grace with the captain of the king's army, and requested him to give him the house of records; and he gave him a command accordingly. <br>
        <sup>47</sup> Then Simeon the priest came in and gathered together the ashes of the books, and laid them in a pot in a vault, and he took a censer of brass, and put fire therein, and threw pure incense upon it, and hung it in the vault over the place in which the ashes of the books lay. <br>
        <sup>48</sup> But [Nebuzaradan] laid waste Jerusalem, like a wilderness. <br>
        <sup>49</sup> And Jeremiah the prophet sat weeping and mourning over Jerusalem twenty years, after which this prophet Jeremiah went into the land of Egypt, and died there. <br>
        <sup>50</sup> But the writers and the interpreters destroyed the writings, and the Hebrews changed the writings; and the Syrians and the Greeks rejected many sections of those writings. <br>
        <sup>51</sup> So that the children of the people could not ascertain [their kindred], neither could men or women hear who were their fathers or their mothers, except very few of them ; And this was because of the laying waste of Jerusalem ; so that until this day, nothing certain is found among the writings, except the chief writings alone, which writings had been translated before the ruin of Jerusalem. <br>
        <sup>52</sup> Then again since some of the writings were altered, people could not ascertain how they were married, and could not know who were their wives or daughters; they did not know their names or their kindred; nor the order of generations; neither did they know that of the priesthood. <br>
        <sup>53</sup> And Jechonias remained twienty-seven years bound in prison at Babylon. <br>
        <sup>54</sup> After that he was released by Marzuk king of Babylon, who gave him to wife, a woman called Dalilah daughter of Eliakim, by whom he had Salathiel in Babylon. <br>
        <sup>55</sup> But Jechonias, Salathiel's father, died at Babylon. <br>
        <sup>56</sup> Then Salathiel took to wife Hadast, daughter of Elkanah; and had by her Zerubbabel. <br>
        <sup>57</sup> And Zerubbabel married a woman whose name was Malka, daughter of Ezra the scribe; but he had no child by her in Babylon. <br>
        <sup>58</sup> Then in the days of Zerubbabel, who was elder among the children of Israel, a Persian king, called Cyrus, who reigned over Babylon, took to wife a woman called Meshar, sister of Zerubbabel, elder among the children of Israel; and he made her queen after the manner of the queens of Persia. <br>
        <sup>59</sup> And when she became queen, she found favour with the king, and asked him to show mercy to the children of Israel, and to send them back to the city of Jerusalem.</p><br>

        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>


        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> But Cyrus loved much Meshar, sister of Zerubbabel, [even] as his own soul. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> So he gave an urgent order that they should go about the whole land of the Chaldaeans, and gather together the children of Israel into Babylon, the house of the kingdom; and they gathered them according to the king's order. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> Then Cyrus said to Zerubbabel, his wife's brother, " Take thy people and go to thy city Jerusalem; and rebuild it as it was at first. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> Then when dutiful Cyrus had given this order concerning the return of the children of Israel to Jerusalem, in the land of the sanctuary; God appeared unto him in a vision during sleep, and said unto him, "Because thou hast done this, they shall call thee
        Cyrus the Messiahnic; and this name, Messiahnic, shall be given thee, because thou hast sent back strangers to their own city ; and because thou hast given commandment concerning
        the rebuilding of Jerusalem." <br>
        <sup>5</sup> Then the children of Israel returned from the captivity of Babylon, Zerubbabel was elder over them; and Josiah, son of Zadok, of the sons of Aaron, was high priest over them; as the angel of God spake to the prophet Zachariah saying, 'Those two sons that stand before the Lord of the whole earth shall minister unto them, as becomes their service." <br>
        <sup>6</sup> Cyrus had assumed the kingdom two years, when the captivity returned from Babylon; and at the end of that year, the five thousand years spoken of to Adam were fulfilled. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> But when the children of Israel returned from Babylon they had not the law, neither was there a book in their hands; inasmuch as the voices of the prophets had departed from among them. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> So, when they came to Jerusalem and were settled in it, Ezra the scribe came to the vault in which were the ashes of the books, which Simeon the priest, had gathered together. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> And Ezra found the censer that was full of fire, hanging with [smoke of] incense rising from it on high. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> Then Ezra prayed to God, wept abundantly, and spread his hand towards the ashes of the books of the law and of the prophets, and all of them three times. <br>
        <sup>11</sup> Then came the Spirit of God upon him, and the [same] Spirit spake through him that had spoken through the prophets. <br>
        <sup>12</sup> And he wrote the law and the prophets, and made them new a second time. <br>
        <sup>13</sup> And the fire which he found in the censer, is the divine fire that was all the time in the House of God. <br>
        <sup>14</sup> Then Zerubbabel settled in Jerusalem as king over the children of Israel, and Josiah son of Zadok as high priest, with Ezra the scribe of the law and the prophets also, as chief over the children of Israel. <br>
        <sup>15</sup> And the children of Israel kept a solemn Passover unto the Lord, when they returned from their captivity at Babylon. <br>
        <sup>16</sup> These were the three great, full and solemn feasts of the Passover, which the children of Israel kept during their existence. <br>
        <sup>17</sup> The first Passover was in Egypt, in the days of Moses; the second Passover was in the days of king Josiah; and the third Passover was when they returned from their captivity in Babylon.</p><br>


        <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> From the first transportation to Babylon, when they carried away Daniel's mother, and she brought him forth, unto the second year of Cyrus the Persian, are seventy years, during
        which the children of Israel were captive, according to the prophecy of holy Jeremiah the prophet. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And the children of Israel began to build the House of God, in the days of Zerubbabel, of Josiah the son of Zadok, and of Ezra the scribe. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And they were forty-six years building it, until it was finished, as it is written in the holy Gospelâ€”that they were forty-six years building it. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> Moreover, scribes arranged tables of genealogy, and recorded the names of the men; but they could not record the names of the women because they knew them not, except very few. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> But, my brethren, I have watched much, and I have searched long in the books of the Greeks and of the ancient Hebrews, and I have found the name of the women written in them. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> For I found that when the children of Israel came from Babylon, that Zerubbabel begat Abiud of Maukabf the daughter of Ezra the scribe ; and that Abiud took to wife Tsamita the daughter of Zadok the high priest, and she bare Eliakim.<br>
        <sup>7</sup> And Eliakim married Hasbia, the daughter of Aram, and brought forth Azar. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And Azar begat Zadok of Lebaida. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> And Zadok took to wife Kalem, the daughter of Waikam, who gave birth to Akim. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> And Akim married Asbaidi, who gave birth to Eliud. <br>
        <sup>11</sup> And Eliud married Awad, the daughter of Gasulius, who gave birth to Azar. <br>
        <sup>12</sup> And Azar married Hayat, daughter of Walha, who brought forth Mattan; and Mattan married Sabartyal the daughter of Phulius, who brought forth twins, namely, Jacob and Joachim. <br>
        <sup>13</sup> And Jacob married Gadat, the daughter of Eleazar, who gave birth to Joseph the betrothed of Mary. <br>
        <sup>14</sup> And Joachim, the brother of Jacob, married Hannah the daughter of Makah; and she brought forth the pure Virgin Mary; and of her was born Christ. <br>
        <sup>15</sup> The former scribes, however, could not find a good lineage for the Virgin and her father, or kindred; wherefore did the Jews crucify Christ, and taunt Him, and mock Him, and say to Him," Show us the fathers of Mary the Virgin and her people, and what is her genealogy.' <br>
        <sup>16</sup> Therefore did they blaspheme her and Christ. <br>
        <sup>17</sup> But henceforth shall the mouth of those unbelieving Jews be closed; and they shall know that Mary is of the seed of David the king, and of that of the patriarch Abraham. <br>
        <sup>18</sup> Moreover, the unbelieving Jews had no registers to guide them aright, neither did they know, how the lines of kindred ran at first, inasmuch as the law and the prophets were three times burnt [out] from them. <br>
        <sup>19</sup> The first time in the days of Antiochus, who burnt down the whole House [of God]; The second time they burnt those books in the days of Qablar the great king of Mosul; <br>
        <sup>20</sup> And the third time they burnt the books was at the transportation by king Nabukadanatsor when Abumirdan came and burnt the House of God, and destroyed the walls of Jerusalem; when Simeon the priest asked of him the store of books, and he gave them to him. </p><br>

        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>

 
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And here, O my brother, behold, I have settled for thee that which is true, and I have revealed unto thee the genealpgy, and laid for thee the firm foundation, which not one of the writers and of the wise men, could make known. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> But, O my brother, give me thy heart and make it clean, that I may tell thee what things remain, and how the reckoning of generations come all round to reach unto and to stand firm by the birth of Christ.  <br>
        <sup>3</sup> But after the birth of Christ there remained no more trustworthy reckoning [of kindred] to the Jews.  <br>
        <sup>4</sup> For Christ was the end of the generations; He took it and gave it to us.  <br>
        <sup>5</sup> But let me tell thee, O my brother, that the five thousand years from [the creation of] Adam, did not end before the days of Cyrus, king of Persia.  <br>
        <sup>6</sup> Then from Cyrus to the sufferings of our Saviour Jesus Christ, even as the faithful Daniel prophesied, saying,"After seven weeks Christ shall come, and shall be put to death." <br>
        <sup>7</sup> Now seven weeks are four hundred and ninety years ; for a great week is of seventy years.  <br>
        <sup>8</sup> But in that the prophet said, "After seven years," he pointed to the ten years [that remained] ; for he did not say, " Christ shall come at the end of the seven weeks,' but he said, " After seven weeks [He shall come] and be put to death." <br>
        <sup>9</sup> But the meaning here of '' after," isâ€”those ten years, that make up the five hundred years.  <br>
        <sup>10</sup> And that is the fulfilment of the promise that God made to Adam, that He would save him
        at the end [of that time] .  <br>
        <sup>11</sup> Henceforth are the mouths of the Jews struck dumb, and to them belongs shame, because they blaspheme and say that Christ is not yet come.  <br>
        <sup>12</sup> But while they say so, they, of necessity, believe the first statement [of the prophets] to be true and the last to be a lie.  <br>
        <sup>13</sup> If they say " Christ came believing, as they do, the prophecy of the prophet Daniel, they now see that the prophecy of Daniel is fulfilled, and that the House of God is laid waste[and taken] from them; that the priesthood is abolished, and that the seven weeks were fulfilled, and that Christ came, and was put to death; and that the Holy City was laid waste by king Vespasian and his son Titus."  <br>
        <sup>14</sup> But let me also tell thee, my brother, that in the thirty second year of the reign of Augustus Caesar, Christ was born in Bethlehem of Judah, as it is written in the Gospel.  <br>
        <sup>15</sup> And, behold, it is made plain to us, that Christ came when the prophecy was fulfilled.  <br>
        <sup>16</sup> As Micah the prophet said, " But thou, O Bethlehem, [in the] land of Judah, thou art not lower than the kings of Judah; for from thee shall come a king, that shall feed my people Israel."  <br>
        <sup>17</sup> Let the Jews now feel ashamed of themselves; for if they make Daniel a liar, they cannot again make the prophet Micah a liar; yet if they will make them liars still, behold,  <br>
        <sup>18</sup> Christ was born in Bethlehem [in] the land of Judah.         <br>
        <sup>19</sup> And when He was born at Bethlehem [in] the land of Judah, a star in the East made it known, and was seen by Magi.  <br>
        <sup>20</sup> That star shone in heaven, amid all the other stars; it flashed and was like the face of a woman, a young virgin, sitting among the stars, flashing, as it were carrying a little child of a beautiful countenance.  <br>
        <sup>21</sup> From the beauty of His looks, both heaven and earth shone, and were filled with His beauty and light above and below; and that child was on the virgin woman's arms; and there was a cloud of light around the child's head, like a crown.  <br>
        <sup>22</sup> But it was a custom of the Chaldaeans to observe the stars of heaven ; to take counsel from them ; and they were numbered by them. <br>
        <sup>23</sup> So when they saw the star of the figure we have just mentioned, they were greatly troubled, and said among themselves, ' Surely the king of the Helonseans is putting himself
        in battle array against us! <br>
        <sup>24</sup> And they inquired among soothsayers and philosophers, until they ascertained the fact and discovered that the king of the children of Israel was born. <br>
        <sup>25</sup> As to this matter of the stars, the Chaldaeans used to work it out, and to take counsel from the power of the stars; so that they knew every event that should be, ere it happened. <br>
        <sup>26</sup> Likewise the captains of large ships, when they went on a voyage upon the seas, [knew beforehand] the signs of winds, of whirlwind, of gloom, and of thick darkness. <br>
        <sup>27</sup> Thus the Magi when they read in their books, knew from them, that Christ should be born in the land of Judah. <br>
        <sup>28</sup> So they went upon a high mountain in the east, while coming westward; and they took with them the presents they had prepared ere they set off on their journey ; that is, gold, frankincense and myrrhâ€”that had been with Adam in the Cave of Treasures. 
        <sup>29</sup>Gold, namely as unto a king ; frankincense, as unto God; and myrrh, as for His death. </p><br>


        <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> But when Hor, king of Persia, heard who it was they called King of kings, he prepared his chariot and mounted it. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> Basantar also, king of Saba, came out ; and Karsundas, king of the East, got himself ready and came out also. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> They were all in great tribulation, and also all other kings in the borders of the West trembled with them, and every country in the East was in great alarm at the sight of that
        glory. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> Then the Magi while on their journey said, "This star has not risen but for some great event' <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And they went on their way until they came to Jerusalem.<br>
        <sup>6</sup> But when Herod heard of it, he was troubled, and called the Magi to him, and communed with them; and they rehearsed unto him the [whole] thing.<br>
        <sup>7</sup> Then he and all his hosts trembled; and he said to the Magi, " Go ye, and inquire diligently concerning this Child; and when ye have found Him, come and tell me, that I also may go and worship Him.<br>
        <sup>8</sup> Then the Magi went forthwith to Bethlehem, and found Christ, and offered Him their gifts. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> But they did not return to Herod ; they went back to their own country.<br>
        <sup>10</sup> But after they were gone, Herod was wroth, and commanded all children of two years and under, to be put to death.<br>
        <sup>11</sup> Then an angel of the Lord appeared unto Joseph, and said to him, " Arise, and take the Child and His mother, and go to the land of Egypt and abide there until I tell thee." <br>
        <sup>12</sup> And Joseph went into the land of Egypt.<br>
        <sup>13</sup> Then Herod began to slay all children, until he had not left one. <br>
        <sup>14</sup> And he died of an evil death. <br>
        <sup>15</sup> After his death an angel of the Lord appeared unto Joseph in the land of Egypt. <br>
        <sup>16</sup> And Joseph came up out of Egypt, and dwelt at Nazareth, he, the child, and Mary His mother.<br>
        <sup>17</sup> And they abode at Jerusalem until Christ was thirty years of age, and was baptized by John.<br>
        <sup>18</sup> This John lived all his days in the wilderness, and his food was locusts and wild honey.<br>
        <sup>19</sup> And in the nineteenth year of Tiberius, our Lord Christ was crucified. <br>
        <sup>20</sup> He died in the body, and was buried, and rose again from among the dead on the third day; as it is written.<br>
        <sup>21</sup> And He went down into hell, and saved Adam and Eve, and all their righteous seed, according to His first and firm promise.<br>
        <sup>22</sup> And thus He fulfilled all that the prophets had prophesied concerning Him.<br>
        <sup>23</sup> He then went up into heaven; whence He will come again with His holy angels, to judge the quick and dead. <br>
        <sup>24</sup> Unto Him be glory, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power and worship for ever. Amen.</p><br>
