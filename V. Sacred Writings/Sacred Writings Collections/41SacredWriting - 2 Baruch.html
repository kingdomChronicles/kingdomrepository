        <!-------------------------------START OF LESSON 1  ------------------------------->
                    
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Announcement of the coming Destruction of Jerusalem to Baruch</p>
        
         
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass in the twenty-fifth year of Jeconiah, king of Judah, that the word of the Lord came to Baruch, the son of Neriah, and said to him: <br>
        <sup>2</sup> 'Have you seen all that this people are doing to Me, that the evils which these two tribes which remained have done are greater than (those of) the ten tribes which were carried away captive? <br>
        <sup>3</sup> For the former tribes were forced by their kings to commit sin, but these two of themselves have been forcing and compelling their kings to commit sin. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> For this reason, behold I bring evil upon this city, and upon its inhabitants, and it shall be removed from before Me for a time, and I will scatter this people among the Gentiles that they may do good to the Gentiles. And My people shall be chastened, and the time shall come when they will seek for the prosperity of their times.</p><br>
        
         
        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup>1 For I have said these things to you that you may bid Jeremiah, and all those that are like you, to retire from this city.<br>
        <sup>2</sup>2 For your works are to this city as a firm pillar,<br>
        And your prayers as a strong wall.'</p><br>
        
        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I said: 'O LORD, my Lord, have I come into the world for this purpose that I might see the evils of my mother? Not (so) my Lord. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> If I have found grace in Your sight, first take my spirit that I may go to my fathers and not behold the destruction of my mother. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> For two things vehemently constrain me: for I cannot resist you, and my soul, moreover, cannot behold the evils of my mother. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> But one thing I will say in Your presence, O Lord. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> What, therefore, will there be after these things? for if you destroy Your city, and deliver up Your land to those that hate us, how shall the name of Israel be again remembered? <br>
        <sup>6</sup> Or how shall one speak of Your praises? or to whom shall that which is in Your law be explained? Or shall the world return to its nature of aforetime, and the age revert to primeval silence? And shall the multitude of souls be taken away, and the nature of man not again be named? And where is all that which you did say regarding us?</p><br>    
        
        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The heavenly Jerusalem</p>

         
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And the Lord said unto me: <br>
        'This city shall be delivered up for a time,<br>
        And the people shall be chastened during a time,<br>
        And the world will not be given over to oblivion.<br>
        <sup>2</sup> [Dost you think that this is that city of which I said: "On the palms of My hands have I graven you"? <br>
        <sup>3</sup> This building now built in your midst is not that which is revealed with Me, that which prepared beforehand here from the time when I took counsel to make Paradise, and showed Adam before he sinned, but when he transgressed the commandment it was removed from him, as also Paradise. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And after these things I showed it to My servant Abraham by night among the portions of the victims. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And again also I showed it to Moses on Mount Sinai when I showed to the likeness of the tabernacle and all its vessels. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And now, behold, it is preserved with Me, as Paradise. 7 Go, therefore, and do as I command you.'] </p><br>
        
         
        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Baruch's Complaint and God's Reassurance</p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I answered and said:<br>
        'So then I am destined to grieve for Zion,<br>
        For your enemies will come to this place and pollute Your sanctuary,<br>
        And lead your inheritance into captivity,<br>
        And make themselves masters of those whom you have loved,<br>
        And they will depart again to the place of their idols,<br>
        And will boast before them:<br>
        And what will you do for Your great name?'<br>
        <sup>2</sup> And the Lord said unto me:<br>
        'My name and My glory are unto all eternity;<br>
        And My judgment shall maintain its right in its own time.<br>
        <sup>3</sup> And you shall see with your eyes<br>
        That the enemy will not overthrow Zion,<br>
        Nor shall they burn Jerusalem,<br>
        But be the ministers of the Judge for the time.<br>
        <sup>4</sup> But do you go and do whatsoever I have said unto you.<br>
        <sup>5</sup> And I went and took Jeremiah, and Adu, and Seriah, and Jabish, and Gedaliah, and all the honorable men of the people, and I led them to the valley of Kidron, and I narrated to them all that had been said to me. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And they lifted up their voice, and they all wept. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And we sat there and fasted until the evening.</p><br>

        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Invasion of the Chaldeans and their Entrance into the City after the Sacred Vessels were hidden and the City's Walls overthrown by Angels</p>
        

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass on the morrow that, lo! the army of the Chaldees surrounded the city, and at the time of the evening, I, Baruch, left the people, and I went forth and stood by the oak. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And I was grieving over Zion, and lamenting over the captivity which had come upon the people. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And lo! suddenly a strong spirit raised me, and bore me aloft over the wall of Jerusalem. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And I beheld, and lo! four angels standing at the four corners of the city, each of them holding a torch of fire in his hands. 5 And another angel began to descend from heaven. and said unto them: 'Hold your lamps, and do not light them till I tell you. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> For I am first sent to speak a word to the earth, and to place in it what the Lord the Most High has commanded me.' <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And I saw him descend into the Holy of Holies, and take from there the veil, and holy ark, and the mercy-seat, and the two tables, and the holy raiment of the priests, and the altar of incense, and the forty-eight precious stones, wherewith the priest was adorned and all the holy vessels of the tabernacle. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And he spoke to the earth with a loud voice:   <br>   
        'Earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the mighty God,    <br>    
        And receive what I commit to you,        <br>
        And guard them until the last times,        <br>
        So that, when you are ordered, you may restore them,    <br>    
        So that strangers may not get possession of them.<br>
        <sup>9</sup> For the time comes when Jerusalem also will be delivered for a time,<br>
         Until it is said, that it is again restored for ever.'<br>
        <sup>10</sup> And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up.</p><br>
        
        <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
         
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And after these things I heard that angel saying unto those angels who held the lamps: 'Destroy, therefore, and overthrow its wall to its foundations, lest the enemy should boast and say:<br>
        " We have overthrown the wall of Zion,<br>
        And we have burnt the place of the mighty God."'<br>
        <sup>2</sup> And they have seized the place where I had been standing before.</p><br>
        
        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Now the angels did as he had commanded them, and when they had broken up the corners of the walls, a voice was heard from the interior of the temple, after the wall had fall saying:<br>
        <sup>2</sup> 'Enter, you enemies,
        And come, you adversaries;
        For he who kept the house has forsaken (it).'<br>
        <sup>3</sup> And I, Baruch, departed. 4 And it came to pass after these things that the army of the Chaldees entered and seized the house, and all that was around it. And they led the people away captive and slew some of them, and bound Zedekiah the king, and sent him to the king of Babylon.</p><br>

        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">First Fast of seven Days: Baruch to remain amid the Ruins of Jerusalem and Jeremiah to accompany the Exiles to Babylon. Baruch's Dirge over Jerusalem</p>
               
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I, Baruch, came, and Jeremiah, whose heart was found pure from sins, who had not been captured in the seizure of the City. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And we rent our garments, we wept, and mourned, and fasted seven days.</p><br>


        <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">First Fast of seven Days: Baruch to remain amid the Ruins of Jerusalem and Jeremiah to accompany the Exiles to Babylon. Baruch's Dirge over Jerusalem</p>

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass after seven days, that the word of God carne to me, and said unto me: <br>
        <sup>2</sup> 'Tell Jeremiah to go and support the captivity of the people unto Babylon. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> But do you remain here amid the desolation of Zion, and I will show to you after these days 'what will befall at the end of days.' <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And I said to Jeremiah as the Lord commanded me. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And he, indeed, departed with the people, but I, Baruch, returned and sat before the gates of the temple, and I lamented with the following lamentation over Zion and said:<br>
        <sup>6</sup> 'Blessed is he who was not born,<br>
        Or he, who having been born, has died.<br>
        <sup>7</sup> But as for us who live, woe unto us,<br>
        Because we see the afflictions of Zion,<br>
        And what has befallen Jerusalem.<br>
        <sup>8</sup> I will call the Sirens from the sea,<br>
        And you Lilin, come you from the desert,<br>
        And you Shedim and dragons from the forests:<br>
        Awake and gird up your loins unto mourning,<br>
        And take up with me the dirges,<br>
        And make lamentation with me.<br>
        <sup>9</sup> Ye husbandmen, sow not again;<br>
        And, O earth, wherefore give� you your harvest fruits?<br>
        Keep within you the sweets of your sustenance.<br>
        <sup>10</sup> And thou, vine, why further do you give your wine;<br>
        For an offering will not again be made from there in Zion,<br>
        Nor will first-fruits again be offered.<br>
        <sup>11</sup> And do ye, O heavens, 'withhold your dew,<br>
        And open not the treasuries of rain:<br>
        <sup>12</sup>  And do thou, O sun withhold the light of your rays.<br>
         And do thou, O moon, extinguish the multitude of your light;<br>
         For why should light rise again<br>
         Where the light of Zion is darkened?<br>
        <sup>13</sup> And you, you bridegrooms, enter not in,<br>
        And let not the brides adorn themselves with garlands;<br>
        And, you women, pray not that you may bear.<br>
        <sup>14</sup> For the barren shall above all rejoice,<br>
        And those who have no sons shall be glad,<br>
        And those who have sons shall have anguish.<br>
        <sup>15</sup> For why should they bear in pain,<br>
        Only to bury in grief?<br>
        <sup>16</sup> Or why, again, should mankind have sons?<br>
        Or why should the seed of their kind again be named,<br>
        Where this mother is desolate,<br>
        And her sons are led into captivity?<br>
        <sup>17</sup> From this time forward speak not of beauty,<br>
        And discourse not of gracefulness.<br>
        <sup>18</sup> Moreover, you priests take you the keys of the sanctuary,<br>
        And cast them into the height of heaven,<br>
        And give them to the Lord and say:<br>
        "Guard Your house Thyself,<br>
        For lo! we are found false stewards."<br>
        <sup>19</sup> And you, you virgins; who weave fine linen<br>
        And silk with gold of Ophir,<br>
        Take with haste all (these) things<br>
        And cast (them) into the fire,<br>
        That it may bear them to Him who made them,<br>
        And the flame send them to Him who created them,<br>
        Lest the enemy get possession of them.'</p><br>
        
         
        <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Moreover, I, Baruch, say this against you, Babylon: <br>
         'If you had prospered, <br>
         And Zion had dwelt in her glory, <br>
         Yet the grief to us had been great <br>
        That you should be equal to Zion.<br>
        <sup>2</sup> But now, lo! the grief is infinite, <br>
         And the lamentation measureless, <br>
         For lo! you are prospered <br>
         And Zion desolate.    <br>    
        <sup>3</sup> Who will be judge regarding these things? <br>
         Or to whom shall we complain regarding that which has befallen us? <br>
         O Lord, how have you borne (it)?        <br>
        <sup>4</sup> Our fathers went to rest without grief, <br>
         And lo! the righteous sleep in the earth in tranquility;    <br>    
        <sup>5</sup> For they knew not this anguish, <br>
         Nor yet had they heard of that which had befallen us.   <br>     
        <sup>6</sup> Would that you had ears, O earth, <br>
         And that you had a heart, O dust: <br>
         That you might go and announce in Sheol, <br>
         And say to the dead:        
        <sup>7</sup> "Blessed are you more than we who live."'</p><br>
        
         
        <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> But I will say this as I think.
        And I will speak against you, O land, which alt prospering.<br>
        <sup>2</sup> The noonday does not always burn.
        Nor do the rays of the sun constantly give light.<br>
        <sup>3</sup> Do not expect Land hope] that you will always he prosperous and rejoicing.
        And be not greatly up lifted and boastful.<br>
        <sup>4</sup> For assuredly in its own season shall the (divine) wrath awake against you.
        Which now in long-suffering is held in as it were by reins.<br>
        <sup>5</sup> And when I had said these things, I fasted seven days.</p><br>
        
        <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that I, Baruch, was standing upon Mount Zion, and lo! a voice came from the height and said unto me: <br>
        <sup>2</sup> 'Stand upon your feet, Baruch, and hear the word of the mighty God.'       <br>
        <sup>3</sup> Because you have been astonished at what has befallen Zion, you shall therefore be assuredly preserved to the consummation of the times, that you may be for a testimony. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> So that, if ever those prosperous cities say: <br>
        <sup>5</sup> 'Why hath the mighty God brought upon us this retribution?' Say you to them, you and those like you who shall have seen this evil: '(This is the evil) and retribution which is coming upon you and upon your people in its (destined) time that the nations may be thoroughly smitten. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And then they shall be in anguish. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And if they say at that time:<br>
        <sup>8</sup> For how long? you will say to them:<br>
        "Ye who have drunk the strained wine,<br>
        Drink you also of its dregs,<br>
        The judgment of the Lofty One<br>
        Who has no respect of persons."'<br>
        <sup>9</sup> On this account he had aforetime no mercy on His own sons,<br>
        But afflicted them as His enemies, because they sinned,<br>
        <sup>10</sup> Then therefore were they chastened<br>
        That they might be sanctified.<br>
        <sup>11</sup> But now, you peoples and nations, you are guilty<br>
        Because you have always trodden down the earth,<br>
        And used the creation unrighteously.<br>
        <sup>12</sup> For I have always benefited you.<br>
        And you have always been ungrateful for the beneficence.<br>
        <sup>13</sup> The Righteousness of the Righteous has profited neither them nor their City; God's Judgments are incomprehensible; the World was made for the Righteous, yet they pass and the World remains <br>
        <sup>14</sup> Answer�Man knows God's Judgments and has sinned willingly.  <br>
        <sup>15</sup> This World is a Weariness to the Righteous but the next is theirs to be won through Character whether a Man's Time here be long or short <br>
        <sup>16</sup> Final Weal or Woe the supreme Question. </p><br>
        
        <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I answered and said: 'Lo! you have shown me the method of the times, and that which shall be after these things, and you have said unto me, that the retribution, which has been spoken of by you, shall come upon the nations. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And now I know that those who have sinned are many, and they have lived in prosperity,' and departed from the world, but the few nations will be left in those times, to whom those words shall he said which you did say. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> For what advantage is there in this, or what (evil), worse than what' we have seen befall us, are we to expect to see?        <br>
        <sup>4</sup> But again I will speak in Your presence: <br>
        <sup>5</sup> What have they profited who had knowledge before you and have not walked in vanity as the rest of the nations, and have not said to the dead: "Give us life," but always feared you, and have not left Your ways? <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And lo! they have been carried off, nor on their account have you had mercy on Zion. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And if others did evil, it was due to Zion that on account of the works of those who wrought good works she should be forgiven, and should not be overwhelmed on account of the works of those who wrought unrighteousness. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> But who, O LORD, my Lord, will comprehend Your judgment,<br>
        Or who will search out the profoundness of Your way?<br>
        Or who will think out the weight of Your path?<br>
        <sup>9</sup> Or who will be able to think out Your incomprehensible counsel?<br>
        Or who of those that are born has ever found<br>
        The beginning or end of Your wisdom?<br>
        <sup>10</sup> For we have all been made like a breath. <br>
        <sup>11</sup> For as the breath ascends involuntarily, and again dies, so it is with the nature of men, who depart not according to their own will, and know not what will befall them in the end. <br>
        <sup>12</sup> For the righteous justly hope for the end, and without fear depart from this habitation, because they have with you a store of works preserved in treasuries. <br>
        <sup>13</sup> On this account also these without fear leave this world, and trusting with joy they hope to receive the world which you have promised them. <br>
        <sup>14</sup> But as for us woe to us, who also are now shamefully entreated, and at that time look forward (only) to evils. <br>
        <sup>15</sup> But you know accurately what you have done by means of Your servants; for we are not able to understand that which is good as you art, our Creator. <br>
        <sup>16</sup> But again I will speak in Your presence, O LORD, my Lord. <br>
        <sup>17</sup> When of old there was no world with its inhabitants, you did devise and speak with a word, and forthwith the works of creation stood before you. <br>
        <sup>18</sup> And you did say that you wouldst make for Your world man as the administrator of Your works, that it might be known that he was by no means made on account of the world, but the world on account of him. <br>
        <sup>19</sup> And now I see that as for the world which was made on account of us, lo! it abides; but we, on account of whom it was made, depart.'</p><br>
        
         
        <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And the Lord answered and said unto me: 'You are rightly astonished regarding the departure of man, but you have not judged well regarding the evils which befall those who sin. <br>

        <sup>24</sup> For there have been many years like those that are desolate from the days of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and of all those who are like them, who sleep in the earth, on whose account you did say that you had created the world. <br>

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And when I had said these things I fell asleep there, and I saw a vision in the night. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And lo! a forest of trees planted on the plain, and lofty and rugged rocky mountains surrounded it, and that forest occupied much space. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And lo! over against it arose a vine, and from under it there went forth a fountain peacefully. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> Now that fountain came to the forest and was (stirred) into great waves, and those waves submerged that forest, and suddenly they rooted out the greater part of that forest, and overthrew all the mountains which were round about it. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And the height of the forest began to be made low, and the top of the mountains was made low and that fountain prevailed greatly, so that it left nothing of that great forest save one cedar only. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> Also when it had cast it down and had destroyed and rooted out the greater part of that forest, so that nothing was left of it, nor could its place be recognized, then that vine began to come with the fountain in peace and great tranquility, and it came to a place which was not far from that cedar, and they brought the cedar which had been cast down to it. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And I beheld and lo! that vine opened its mouth and spoke and said to that cedar: Art you not that cedar which was left of the forest of wickedness, and by whose means wickedness persisted, and was wrought all those years, and goodness never. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And you kept conquering that which was not yours, and to that which was your you did never show compassion, and you did keep extending your power over those who were far from you, and those who drew near you, you did hold fast in the toils of your wickedness, and you did uplift thyself always as one that could not be rooted out! <br>
        <sup>9</sup> But now your time has sped and your hour is come. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> Do you also therefore depart, O cedar, after the forest, which departed before you, and become dust with it, and let your ashes be mingled together. <br>
        <sup>11</sup> And now recline in anguish and rest in torment till your last time come, in which you will come again, and be tormented still more.' </p><br>

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And after these things I saw that cedar burning, and the vine growing, itself and all around it, the plain full of unfading flowers. <br>

        <sup>2</sup> Your law is life, and Your wisdom is right guidance. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> Make known to me therefore the interpretation of this vision. <br>

        <sup>2</sup> As you have seen the great forest which lofty and rugged mountains surrounded, this is the word. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> Behold! the days come, and this kingdom will be destroyed which once destroyed Zion, and it will be subjected to that which comes after it. <br>

        <sup>5</sup> And after these things a fourth kingdom will arise, whose power will be harsh and evil far beyond those which were before it, and it will rule many times as the forests on the plain, and it will hold fast for times, and will exalt itself more than the cedars of Lebanon. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And by it the truth will be hidden, and all those who are polluted with iniquity will flee to it, as evil beasts flee and creep into the forest. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And it will come to pass when the time of its consummation that it should fall has approached, then the principate of My Messiah will be revealed, which is like the fountain and the vine, and when it is revealed it will root out the multitude of its host. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And as touching that which you have seen, the lofty cedar, which was left of that forest, and the fact, that the vine spoke those words with it which you did hear, this is the word.</p><br>

        And you weigh the lightness of the wind.<br>
        <sup>5</sup> You explore the limit of the heights,<br>

        <sup>15</sup> And take not account of our works; For what are we?<br>
        For lo! by Your gift do we come into the world,<br>
        And we depart not of our own will.<br>

        <sup>17</sup> What therefore is our strength that we should bear Your wrath,<br>
        Or what are we that we should endure Your judgment?<br>
        <sup>18</sup> Protect us in Your compassions,<br>

        <sup>19</sup> Behold the little ones that are subject unto you,<br>

        And I will say as my heart thinks.<br>
        <sup>22</sup> In you do we trust, for lo! Your law is with us,<br>
        And we know that we shall not fall so long as we keep Your statutes.<br>
        <sup>23</sup> [To all time are we blessed at all events in this that we have not mingled with the Gentiles.]<br>
        <sup>24</sup> For we are all one celebrated people,<br>
        Who have received one law from One:<br>
        And the law which is amongst us will aid us,<br>
        And the surpassing wisdom which is in us will help us.'<br>
        <sup>25</sup> And when I had prayed and said these things, I was greatly weakened. <br>
        <sup>26</sup> And He answered and said unto me:<br>
        'You have prayed simply, O Baruch,<br>
        And all your words have been heard.<br>
        <sup>27</sup> But My judgment exacts its own<br>

        <sup>28</sup> For from your words I will answer you,<br>
        And from your prayer I will speak to you.<br>
        <sup>29</sup> For this is as follows: he that is corrupted is not at all; he has both wrought iniquity so far as lie could do anything, and has not remembered My goodness, nor accepted My long-suffering. <br>
        <sup>30</sup> Therefore you shall surely be taken up, as I before told you. <br>
        <sup>31</sup> For that time shall arise which brings affliction; for it shall come and pass by with quick vehemence, and it shall be turbulent coming in the heat of indignation. <br>
        <sup>32</sup> And it shall come to pass in those days that all the inhabitants of the earth shall be moved one against another, because they know not that My judgment has drawn nigh.<br>
        <sup>33</sup> For there shall not be found many wise at that time,<br>
        And the intelligent shall be but a few:<br>
        Moreover, even those who know shall most of all be silent.<br>
        <sup>34</sup> And there shall be many rumors and tidings not a few,<br>
        And the doing of phantasms shall be manifest,<br>
        And promises not a few be recounted,<br>
        Some of them (shall prove) idle,<br>
        And some of them shall be confirmed.<br>
        <sup>35</sup> And honor shall be turned into shame,<br>
        And strength humiliated into contempt,<br>
        And probity destroyed,<br>
        And beauty shall become ugliness.<br>
        <sup>36</sup> And many shall say to many at that time:<br>
        "Where hath the multitude of intelligence hidden itself,<br>
        And whither hath the multitude of wisdom removed itself?"<br>
        <sup>37</sup> And whilst they are meditating these things,<br>
        Then envy shall arise in those who had not thought aught of themselves (?)<br>
        And passion shall seize him that is peaceful,<br>
        And many shall be stirred up in anger to injure many,<br>
        And they shall rouse up armies in order to shed blood,<br>
        And in the end they shall perish together with them.<br>
        <sup>38</sup> And it shall come to pass at the self-same time,<br>
        That a change of times shall manifestly appeal to every man,<br>
        Because in all those times they polluted themselves<br>
        And they practiced oppression,<br>
        And walked every man in his own works,<br>
        And remembered not the law of the Mighty One.<br>
        <sup>39</sup> Therefore a fire shall consume their thoughts,<br>
        And in flame shall the meditations of their reins be tried;<br>
        For the Judge shall come and will not tarry.<br>
        <sup>40</sup> Because each of the inhabitants of the earth knew when he was transgressing.<br>
        But My Law they knew not by reason of their pride.<br>
        <sup>41</sup> But many shall then assuredly weep,<br>
        Yea, over the living more than over the dead.'<br>
        <sup>42</sup> And I answered and said:<br>
        'O Adam, what have you done to all those who are born from you?<br>
        And what will be said to the first Eve who hearkened to the serpent?<br>
        <sup>43</sup> For all this multitude are going to corruption,<br>
        Nor is there any numbering of those whom the fire devours.<br>
        <sup>44</sup> But again I will speak in Your presence. <br>
        <sup>45</sup> You, O LORD, my Lord, know what is in Your creature. <br>
        <sup>46</sup> For you did of old command the dust to produce Adam, and you know the number of those who are born from him, and how far they have sinned before you, who have existed and not confessed you as their Creator. <br>
        <sup>47</sup> And as regards all these their end shall convict them, and Your law which they have transgressed shall requite them on Your day.' </p><br>

        <sup>2</sup> For the aspect of those who now act wickedly shall become worse than it is, as they shall suffer torment. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> Also (as for) the glory of those who have now been justified in My law, who have had understanding in their life, and who have planted in their heart the root of wisdom, then their splendor shall be glorified in changes, and the form of their face shall be turned into the light of their beauty, that they may be able to acquire and receive the world which does not die, which is then promised to them. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> For over this above all shall those who come then lament, that they rejected My law, and stopped their ears that they might not hear wisdom or receive understanding. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> When therefore they see those, over whom they are now exalted, (but) who shall then be exalted and glorified more than they, they shall respectively be transformed, the latter into the splendor of angels, and the former shall yet more waste away in wonder at the visions and in the beholding of the forms. <br>

        And to whom the law has been now a hope,<br>
        And understanding an expectation,<br>
        And wisdom a confidence,<br>
        Shall wonders appear in their time.<br>
        <sup>8</sup> For they shall behold the world which is now invisible to them, <br>
        And they shall behold the time which is now hidden from them:<br>

        And they shall be changed into every form they desire,<br>
        From beauty into loveliness,<br>
        And from light into the splendor of glory.<br>
        <sup>11</sup> For there shall be spread before them the extents of Paradise, and there shall be shown to them the beauty of the majesty of the living creatures which are beneath the throne, and all the armies of the angels, who are now held fast by My word, lest they should appear, and] are held fast by a command, that they may stand in their places till their advent comes. <br>
        <sup>12</sup> Moreover, there shall then be excellency in the righteous surpassing that in the angels. <br>
        <sup>13</sup> For the first shall receive the last, those whom they were expecting, and the last those of whom they used to hear that they had passed away.<br>
        <sup>14</sup> For they have been delivered from this world of tribulation,<br>
        And laid down the burthen of anguish.<br>
        <sup>15</sup> For what then have men lost their life,<br>
        And for what have those who were on the earth exchanged their soul?<br>
        <sup>16</sup> For then they chose (not) for themselves this time,<br>
        Which, beyond the reach of anguish, could not pass away:<br>
        But they chose for themselves that time,<br>
        Whose issues are full of lamentations and evils,<br>
        And they denied the world which ages not those who come to it,<br>
        And they rejected the time of glory,<br>

        <sup>1</sup> And when I had said these things I fell asleep there, and I saw a vision, and lo! a cloud was ascending from a very great sea, and I kept gazing upon it and lo! it was full of waters white and black, and there were many colors in those self-same waters, and as it were the likeness of great lightning was seen at its summit. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And I saw the cloud passing swiftly in quick courses, and it covered all the earth. <br>

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I besought the Mighty One, and said:<br>
        'You alone, O Lord, know of aforetime the deep things of the world,<br>
        And the things which befall in their times You bring about by Your word, <br>
        And against the works of the inhabitants of the earth you do hasten the beginnings of the times,<br>
        And the end of the seasons you alone know.<br>
        <sup>2</sup> (You) for whom nothing is too hard,<br>
        But who do everything easily by a nod:<br>
        <sup>3</sup> (You) to whom the depths come as the heights,<br>
        And whose word the beginnings of the ages serve:<br>
        <sup>4</sup> (You) who reveal to those who fear you what is prepared for them,<br>
        That thenceforth they may be comforted.<br>
        <sup>5</sup> You show great acts to those who know not;<br>
        You break up the enclosure of those who are ignorant,<br>
        And lightest up what is dark,<br>
        And reveal what is hidden to the pure,<br>
        [Who in faith have submitted themselves to you and Your law.]<br>
        <sup>6</sup> You have shown to Your servant this vision;<br>
        Reveal to me also its interpretation.<br>
        <sup>7</sup> For I know that as regards those things wherein I besought you, I have received a response,<br>
        And as regards what I besought, you did reveal to me with what voice I should praise you,<br>
        And from what members I should cause praises and hallelujahs to ascend to you.<br>
        <sup>8</sup> For if my members were mouths,<br>
        And the hairs of my head voices,<br>
        Even so I could not give you the reward of praise,<br>
        Nor laud you as is befitting,<br>
        Nor could I recount Your praise,<br>
        Nor tell the glory of Your beauty.<br>
        <sup>9</sup> For what am I amongst men,<br>
        Or why am I reckoned amongst those who are more excellent than I,<br>
        That I have heard all these marvelous things from the Most High,<br>
        And numberless promises from Him who created me?<br>
        <sup>10</sup> Blessed be my mother among those that bear,<br>
        And praised among women be she that bare me.<br>
        <sup>11</sup> For I will not be silent in praising the Mighty One,<br>
        And with the voice of praise I will recount His marvelous deeds.<br>
        <sup>12</sup> For who doeth like unto Your marvelous deeds, O God,<br>
        Or who comprehend Your deep thought of life.<br>
        <sup>13</sup> For with Your counsel you do govern all the creatures which Your right hand has created<br>
        And you have established every fountain of light beside you,<br>
        And the treasures of wisdom beneath Your throne have you prepared.<br>
        <sup>14</sup> And justly do they perish who have not loved Your law,<br>
        And the torment of judgment shall await those who have not submitted themselves to Your power.<br>
        <sup>15</sup> For though Adam first sinned<br>
        And brought untimely death upon all,<br>
        Yet of those who were born from him<br>
        Each one of them has prepared for his own soul torment to come,<br>
        And again each one of them has chosen for himself glories to come.<br>
        <sup>16</sup> [For assuredly he who believeth will receive reward.<br>
        <sup>17</sup> But now, as for you, you wicked that now are, turn you to destruction, <br>because you shall speedily be visited, in that formerly you rejected the understanding of the Most High.<br>
        <sup>18</sup> For His works have not taught you,<br>
        Nor has the skill of His creation which is at all times persuaded you.]<br>
        <sup>19</sup> Adam is therefore not the cause, save only of his own soul,<br>
        But each of us has been the Adam of his own soul.<br>
        <sup>20</sup> But do You, O Lord, expound to me regarding those things which you have revealed to me,<br>
        And inform me regarding that which I besought you.<br>
        <sup>21</sup> For at the consummation of the world vengeance shall be taken upon those who have done wickedness according to their wickedness,<br>
        And you will glorify the faithful according to their faithfulness.<br>
        <sup>22</sup> For those who are amongst your own you rule,<br>
        And those who sin you blot out from amongst your own.'</p><br>

        How much more when the event will reveal marvelous things?<br>
        <sup>8</sup> And if you have heard tidings of the good and evil things which are then coming and are grieved,<br>

        <sup>2</sup> And the Mighty One hath assuredly made known to you the methods of the times that have passed, and of those that are destined to pass in His world from the beginning of its creation even unto its consummation, of those things which (are) deceit and of those which (are) in truth. 
        <sup>3</sup> For as you did see a great cloud which ascended from the sea, and went and covered the earth, this is the duration of the world (= αιων) which the Mighty One made when he took counsel to make the world. 
        <sup>4</sup> And it came to pass when the word had gone forth from His presence, that the duration of the world had come into being in a small degree, and was established according to the multitude of the intelligence of Him who sent it. 
        <sup>5</sup> And as you did previously see on the summit of the cloud black waters which descended previously on the earth, this is the transgression wherewith Adam the first man transgressed. <br>

        Untimely death came into being,<br>
        Grief was named<br>

        And the begetting of children was brought about,<br>
        And the passion of parents produced,<br>
        And the greatness of humanity was humiliated,<br>
        And goodness languished.<br>
        <sup>7</sup> What therefore can be blacker or darker than these things? <br>
        <sup>8</sup> This is the beginning of the black waters which you have seen. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> And from these black (waters) again were black derived, and the darkness of darkness was produced. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> For he became a danger to his own soul: even to the angels <br>
        <sup>11</sup> For, moreover, at that time when he was created, they enjoyed liberty. <br>
        <sup>12</sup> And became he a danger some of them descended, and mingled with the women. <br>
        <sup>13</sup> And then those who did so were tormented in chains. <br>
        <sup>14</sup> But the rest of the multitude of the angels, of which there is (no) number, restrained themselves. <br>

        <sup>4</sup> "Behold, for lo! Sennacherib is prepared to destroy us, and he will be boastful and uplifted when he has destroyed Zion."

        And He had respect unto his prayer, because he was righteous.<br>
        <sup>6</sup> And thereupon the Mighty One commanded Ramiel His angel who speaks with you. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And I went forth and destroyed their multitude, the number of whose chiefs only was a hundred and eighty-five thousand, and each one of them had an equal number (at his command). <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And at that time I burned their bodies within, but their raiment and arms I preserved outwardly, in order that the still more wonderful deeds of the Mighty One might appear, and that thereby His name might be spoken of throughout the whole earth. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> And Zion was saved and Jerusalem delivered: Israel also was freed from tribulation. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> And all those who were in the holy land rejoiced, and the name of the Mighty One was glorified so that it was spoken of <br>

        <sup>3</sup> And he made an image with five faces: four of them looked to the four winds, and the fifth on the summit of the image as ah adversary of the zeal of the Mighty One. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And then wrath went forth from the presence of the Mighty One to the intent that Zion should be rooted out, as also it befell in your days. But also against the two tribes and a half went forth a decree that they should also be led away captive, as you have now seen. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And to such a degree did the impiety of Manasseh increase, that it removed the praise of the Most High from the sanctuary. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> On this account Manasseh was at that time named 'the impious," and finally his abode was in the fire. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> For though his prayer was heard with the Most High, finally, when he was cast into the brazen horse and the brazen horse was melted, it served as a sign unto him for the hour. <br>

        <sup>3</sup> For to you and to your fathers the Lord gave a law more excellent than to all peoples. <br>

        And He spared not the former, <br>
        And the latter also He gave into captivity: <br>
        And He left not a residue of them, <br>

        And He is gracious in whom you hope, <br>
        And He is true, so that He shall do good and not evil. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> Have you not seen here what has befallen Zion? <br>

        And that on this account it was overthrown? <br>
        Or that the land had wrought foolishness, <br>
        And that therefore it was delivered up? <br>

        <sup>12</sup> Nevertheless, do this for us your people: write also to our brethren in Babylon an epistle of doctrine and a scroll of hope, that you may confirm them also before you do depart from us.<br>

        <sup>21</sup> 'The Most High hath made you that you should be higher than all birds.  <br>
        <sup>22</sup> And now go and tarry not in (any) place, nor enter a nest, nor settle upon any tree, till you have passed over the breadth of the many waters of the river Euphrates, and have gone to the people that dwell there, and cast down to them this epistle.  <br>
        <sup>23</sup> Remember, moreover, that, at the time of the deluge, Noah received from a dove the fruit of the olive, when he sent it forth from the ark.  <br>
        <sup>24</sup> Yea, also the ravens ministered to Elijah, bearing him food, as they had been commanded.  <br>
        <sup>25</sup> Solomon also, in the time of his kingdom, whithersoever he wished to send or seek for anything, commanded a bird (to go thither), and it obeyed him as he commanded it.  <br>
        <sup>26</sup> And now let it not weary you, and turn not to the right hand nor the left, but fly and go by a direct way, that you may preserve the command of the Mighty One, according as I said unto you.'</p><br>

        <p class="chapterTitle">THE EPISTLE OF BARUCH THE SON OF NERIAH WHICH HE WROTE TO THE NINE AND A HALF TRIBES</p>  
        

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> These are the words of that epistle which Baruch the son of Neriah sent to the nine and a half tribes, which were across the river Euphrates, in which these things were written.<br>
        <sup>2</sup> Thus says Baruch the son of Neriah to the brethren carried into captivity: 'Mercy and peace.' I bear in mind, my brethren, the love of Him who created us, who loved us from of old, and never hated us, but above all educated us. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And truly I know that behold all we the twelve tribes are bound by one bond, inasmuch as we are born from one father. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> Wherefore I have been the more careful to leave you the words of this epistle before I die, that you may be comforted regarding the evils which have come upon you, and that you may be grieved also regarding the evil that has befallen your brethren; and again, also, that you may justify His judgment which <br>
        <sup>5</sup> He has decreed against you that you should be carried away captive for what you have suffered is disproportioned to what you have done in order that, at the last times, you may be found worthy of your fathers. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> Therefore, if you consider that ye have now suffered those things for your good, that you may not finally be condemned and tormented, then you will receive eternal hope; if above all you destroy from your heart vain error, on account of which you departed hence. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> For if you so do these things, He will continually remember you, He who always promised on our behalf to those who were more excellent than we, that He will never forget or forsake us, but with much mercy will gather together again those who were dispersed.</p><br>
        
         
        <h2>Chapter 79</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>  
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Now, my brethren, learn first what befell Zion: how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against us. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> For we have sinned against Him who made us, and we have not kept the commandments which he commanded us, yet he hath not chastened us as we deserved. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> For what befell you we also suffer in a preeminent degree, for it befell us also.</p><br>
        
         
        <h2>Chapter 80</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p> 
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And now, my brethren, I make known unto you that when the enemy had surrounded the city, the angels of the Most High were sent, and they overthrew the fortifications of the strong wall, and they destroyed the firm iron corners, which could not be rooted out. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> Nevertheless, they hid all the vessels of the sanctuary, lest the enemy should get possession of them. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And when they had done these things, they delivered thereupon to the enemy the overthrown wall, and the plundered house, and the burnt temple, and the people who were overcome because they were delivered up, lest the enemy should boast and say: 'Thus by force have we been able to lay waste even the house of the Most High in war.' <br>
        <sup>4</sup> Your brethren also have they bound and led away to Babylon, and have caused them to dwell there. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> But we have been left here, being very few. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> This is the tribulation about which I wrote to you. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> For assuredly I know that (the consolation of) the inhabitants of Zion consoles you : so far as you knew that it was prospered (your consolation) was greater than the tribulation which you endured in having to depart from it.</p><br>
        
         
        <h2>Chapter 81</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p> 
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> But regarding consolation, hear the word. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> For I was mourning regarding Zion, and I prayed for mercy from the Most High, and I said:<br>
        <sup>3</sup> 'How long will these things endure for us?<br>
        And will these evils come upon us always?'<br>
        <sup>4</sup> And the Mighty One did according to the multitude of His mercies,<br>
        And the Most High according to the greatness of His compassion,<br>
        And He revealed unto me the word, that I might receive consolation,<br>
        And He showed me visions that I should not again endure anguish,<br>
        And He made known to me the mystery of the times.<br>
        And the advent of the hours he showed me. </p><br>
        
         
        <h2>Chapter 82</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p> 
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Therefore, my brethren, I have written to you, that you may comfort yourselves regarding the multitude of your tribulations. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> For know you that our Maker will assuredly avenge us on all our enemies, according to all that they have done to us, also that the consummation which the Most High will make is very nigh, and His mercy that is coming, and the consummation of His judgment, is by no means far off.<br>
        <sup>3</sup> For lo! we see now the multitude of the prosperity of the Gentiles,<br>
        Though they act impiously,<br>
        But they shall be like a vapor:<br>
        <sup>4</sup> And we behold the multitude of their power,<br>
        Though they do wickedly,<br>
        But they shall be made like unto a drop:<br>
        <sup>5</sup> And we see the firmness of their might.<br>
        Though they resist the Mighty One every hour,<br>
        But they shall be accounted as spittle.<br>
        <sup>6</sup> And we consider the glory of their greatness,<br>
        Though they do not keep the statutes of the Most High,<br>
        But as smoke shall they pass away.<br>
        <sup>7</sup> And we meditate on the beauty of their gracefulness,<br>
        Though they have to do with pollutions,<br>
        But as grass that withers shall they fade away.<br>
        <sup>8</sup> And we consider the strength of their cruelty,<br>
        Though they remember not the end (thereof),<br>
        But as a wave that passes shall they be broken.<br>
        <sup>9</sup> And we remark the boastfulness of their might,<br>
        Though they deny the beneficence of God, who gave (it) to them,<br>
        But they shall pass away as a passing cloud. </p><br>
        
         
        <h2>Chapter 83</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>  
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> [For the Most High will assuredly hasten His times, <br>
        And He will assuredly bring on His hours. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And He will assuredly judge those who are in His world, <br>
        And will visit in truth all things by means of all their hidden works. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And He will assuredly examine the secret thoughts, <br>
        And that which is laid up in the secret chambers of all the members of mail. And will make (them) manifest in the presence of all with reproof. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> Let none therefore of these present things ascend into your hearts, but above all let us be expectant, because that which is promised to us shall come.  <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And let us not now look unto the delights of the Gentiles in the present, but let us remember what has been promised to us in the end.  <br>
        <sup>6</sup> For the ends of the times and of the seasons and whatsoever is with them shall assuredly pass by together.  <br>
        <sup>7</sup> The consummation, moreover, of the age shall then show the great might of its ruler, when all things come to judgment.  <br>
        <sup>8</sup> Do you therefore prepare your hearts for that which before you believed, lest you come to be in bondage in both worlds, so that you be led away captive here and be tormented there.  <br>
        <sup>9</sup> For that which exists now or which has passed away, or which is to come, in all these things, neither is the evil fully evil, nor again the good fully good. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> For all healthinesses of this time are turning into diseases, <br>
        <sup>11</sup> And all might of this time is turning into weakness, <br>
        And all the force of this time is turning into impotence, <br>
        <sup>12</sup> And every energy of youth is turning into old age and consummation. <br>
        And every beauty of gracefulness of this time is turning faded and hateful, <br>
        <sup>13</sup> And every proud dominion of the present is turning into humiliation and shame, <br>
        <sup>14</sup> And every praise of the glory of this time is turning into the shame of silence, <br>
        And every vain splendor and insolence of this time is turning into voiceless ruin. <br>
        <sup>15</sup> And every delight and joy of this time is turning to worms and corruption, <br>
        <sup>16</sup> And every clamor of the pride of this time is turning into dust and stillness. <br>
        <sup>17</sup> And every possession of riches of this time is being turned into Sheol alone, <br>
        <sup>18</sup> And all the rapine of passion of this time is turning into involuntary death, <br>
        And every passion of the lusts of this time is turning into a judgment of torment. <br>
        <sup>19</sup> And every artifice and craftiness of this time is turning into a proof of the truth, <br>
        <sup>20</sup> And every sweetness of unguents of this time is turning into judgment and condemnation, <br>
        <sup>21</sup> And every love of lying is turning to contumely through truth. <br>
        <sup>22</sup> [Since therefore all these things are done now, does anyone think that they will not be avenged? But the consummation of all things will come to the truth.]</p><br>

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Behold! I have therefore made known unto you (these things) whilst I live: for I have said (it) that you should learn the things that are excellent; for the Mighty One hath commanded me to instruct you: and I will set before you some of the commandments of His judgment before I die. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> Remember that formerly Moses assuredly called heaven and earth to witness against you and said: 'If you transgress the law you shall be dispersed, but if you keep it you shall be kept.' <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And other things also he used to say unto you when you the twelve tribes were together in the desert. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And after his death you cast them away from you: on this account there came upon you what had been predicted. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And now Moses used to tell you before they befell you, and lo! they have befallen you: for you have forsaken the law. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> Lo! I also say unto you after you have suffered, that if you obey those things which have been said unto you, you will receive from the Mighty One whatever has been laid up and reserved for you. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> Moreover, let this epistle be for a testimony between me and you, that you may remember the commandments of the Mighty One, and that also there may be to me a defense in the presence of Him who sent me. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And remember you the law and Zion, and the holy land and your brethren, and the covenant of your fathers, and forget not the festivals and the Sabbaths. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> And deliver this epistle and the traditions of the law to your sons after you, as also your fathers delivered (them) to you. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> And at all times make request perseveringly and pray diligently with your whole heart that the Mighty One may be reconciled to you, and that He may not reckon the multitude of your sins, but remember the rectitude of your fathers. <br>
        <sup>11</sup> For if He judge us not according to the multitude of His mercies, woe unto all us who are born.</p><br>

        <sup>1</sup> [Know, moreover, that<br>        
        In former times and in the generations of old our fathers had helpers, <br>        
        Righteous men and holy prophets:<br>        
        <sup>2</sup> No more, we were in our own land<br>
