 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">The Holy Family Among Robbers</p>
                               

<p>
<sup>1</sup>At some distance from the road by which they were travelling, a light glimmered through the dark-ness. <br>
<sup>2</sup>It proceeded from a hut belonging to a gang of robbers, who had hung a light on a neighboring tree, thus to allure travelers. <br>
<sup>3</sup>The road too, here and there, was broken by pits over which cords with little bells were stretched. <br>
<sup>4</sup>The ringing of these bells gave notice to the robbers of the presence of luckless wayfarers. <br>
<sup>5</sup>All on a sudden, I saw a man with about five comrades surrounding the Holy Family. <br>
<sup>6</sup>All were actuated by wicked intentions. <br>
<sup>7</sup>But when they looked at the Child, I saw a glittering ray like an arrow penetrating the heart of the leader, who straightaway commanded his comrades to offer no injury to the strangers. <br>
<sup>8</sup>Mary also saw the ray. <br>
<sup>9</sup>The robber now took the Holy Family to his home, and told his wife how strangely his heart had been moved. <br>
<sup>10</sup>The people were at first shy and shamefaced, something very unusual for them; still they approached, little by little, and gathered around the Holy Family, who had seated themselves in a corner on the ground. <br>
<sup>11</sup>Some of the men went in and out, while the woman brought to Mary little rolls, fruits, honeycomb, and cups containing something to drink. <br>
<sup>12</sup>The ass also was placed under shelter. <br>
<sup>13</sup>The woman cleared out a small room for Mary and brought her a little tub of water in which to bathe the Child. <br>
<sup>14</sup>She also dried the swathing bands for her at the fire. <br>
<sup>15</sup>The husband was deeply impressed by the demeanor of the Holy Family, and especially the appearance of the Child. <br>
<sup>16</sup>He said to his wife, “This Hebrew Child is no ordinary child. <br>
<sup>17</sup>Beg the Lady to allow us to wash our leprous child in His bathing water. <br>
<sup>18</sup>It may, perhaps, do it some good.”<br>
<sup>19</sup>The wife went to request the favor of the Blessed Virgin; but before she had time to speak, Mary bade her take the water she had used for Jesus’ bath, wash the sick child in it, and it would become cleaner than it was before attacked by the disease. <br>
<sup>20</sup>The boy was about three years old and stiff from leprosy. <br>
<sup>21</sup>His mother carried him in and put him into the bath. <br>
<sup>22</sup>Wherever the water touched him, the leprosy fell like scales to the bottom of the tub; the boy became clean and well. <br>
<sup>23</sup>The mother was out of herself with joy; she wanted to embrace Mary and the Child Jesus. <br>
<sup>24</sup>But Mary, stretching out her hand, warded her off; she would allow neither the Child nor herself to be touched by her. <br>
<sup>25</sup>She told her to dig a hole deep down to a rock, and pour the water just used into it, that she might always have it for similar purposes. <br>
<sup>26</sup>Mary spoke with her long, and exacted from her a promise to embrace the first opportunity of escape from her present abode. <br>
<sup>27</sup>The people were all delighted; they stood around the Holy Family gazing at them in wonder. <br>
<sup>28</sup>During the night, other members of their band came to the hut, and to them the boy’s cure was related. <br>
<sup>29</sup>The robbers’ reverential bearing toward the Holy Family was so much the more remarkable, since I saw that night many travelers, attracted to their hut by the light, immediately taken prisoner and carried deep into the forest to an immense cave that served for their special storehouse. <br>
<sup>30</sup>It lay under a thicket, the entrance closely concealed. <br>
<sup>31</sup>In it were clothes, carpets, meat, goats, sheep, and innumerable other stolen things, all in profusion. <br>
<sup>32</sup>I saw also boys about seven or eight years old whom the robbers had kidnapped. <br>
<sup>33</sup>They were cared for by an old woman who lived in the cave.<br>
<sup>34</sup>Mary slept none that night; she sat upon her couch on the floor perfectly still. <br>
<sup>35</sup>At early dawn the Holy Family started again on their journey in spite of the robber and his wife, who wanted them to stay longer. <br>
<sup>36</sup>They took with them a supply of provisions put up by their grateful host and hostess who also accompanied them a part of the way, that they might escape the snares.<br>
<sup>37</sup>The robber and his wife took leave of the Holy Family with expressions of deep feeling, uttering these remarkable words: “Remember us wherever you go!” Upon hearing them, I had a vision in which I saw that the cured boy afterward turned out to be the Good Thief who on the cross said to Jesus: “Remember me when Thou comest into Thy Kingdom.”<br>
<sup>38</sup>The robber’s wife, after some time, joined those that dwelt around the balsam garden.<br>
<sup>39</sup>The Holy Family went from here further on into the desert. <br>
<sup>40</sup>When they had again lost all trace of anything like a path, they were a second time surrounded by all kinds of animals, among them huge winged lizards and even serpents, which pointed out the way to them.<br>
<sup>41</sup>At a later period, when unable to advance through the sandy plain in which they were, I saw a very lovely miracle. <br>
<sup>42</sup>On either side of the road sprouted up the plant Rose of Jericho, with its crisped branches, its tiny flowers in the center, and its straight root. <br>
<sup>43</sup>On they went now right joyously, watching as far as the eye could see these plants springing up, and so across the whole plain. <br>
<sup>44</sup>I saw that it was revealed to the Blessed Virgin that, at some future day the people of the country would gather these roses and sell them to travelers in exchange for bread. <br>
<sup>45</sup>The name of this region sounded like Gaza, or Goze.<br>
<sup>46</sup>I saw the Holy Family arrive at a town and district called Lepe or Lape, in which were numerous canals and ditches with high dams. <br>
<sup>47</sup>I saw them crossing the water on a raft. <br>
<sup>48</sup>Mary sat on a log, and the ass was standing in something like a trough, or tub. <br>
<sup>49</sup>Two ugly, brown-complexioned, half-naked men with flat noses and protruding lips, ferried them over. <br>
<sup>50</sup>Our holy travelers came now to the house on the outskirts of the town; but the occupants were so rough and pitiless that, without saying a word, Mary and Joseph moved further on. <br>
<sup>51</sup>I think this was the first pagan Egyptian city they had yet reached. <br>
<sup>52</sup>They had made, up to this time, ten days’ journey in the Jewish country and then in the wilderness.<br>
<sup>53</sup>I next saw the Holy Family on Egyptian territory, in a level, green country full of pasture grounds. <br>
<sup>54</sup>In the trees were stationed idols like swathed dolls, or like fishes wrapped in broad bands upon which were figures or letters. <br>
<sup>55</sup>Occasionally, I saw people fat, but short in stature, approaching these idols and venerating them. <br>
<sup>56</sup>The Holy Family sought a little rest under the cattle shed, the cattle going out of their own accord to make room for them. <br>
<sup>57</sup>They were in want of food, having neither bread nor water. <br>
<sup>58</sup>Mary no longer had nourishment for her Child, and no one gave them anything. <br>
<sup>59</sup>Every species of human misery was experienced by them during this flight.<br>
<sup>60</sup>At last, some shepherds drew near to water their cattle. <br>
<sup>61</sup>They, too, would have gone away without giving them anything, had not Joseph’s entreaties moved them to unlock the well and allow them to have a little water.<br>
<sup>62</sup>Again, I saw the Holy Family weary and exhausted in a forest, at whose egress stood a slender date tree, the fruit all clustered on top. <br>
<sup>63</sup>Mary approached the tree, the Child Jesus on her arm, prayed and raised the Child up to it. <br>
<sup>64</sup>Instantly the tree bowed down its top as if kneeling, so that Mary could gather all its fruit. <br>
<sup>65</sup>It afterward remained in that position. <br>
<sup>66</sup>I saw Mary dividing a quantity of the fruit among the naked children who had run after them from the last village.<br>
<sup>67</sup>At a quarter of an hour’s distance from this tree, stood another unusually large one of the same kind, very high, and hollow like an old oak. <br>
<sup>68</sup>In it the Holy Family lay concealed from the people that followed them. <br>
<sup>69</sup>That evening I saw them taking shelter within the walls of a ruined place, where they stayed overnight.</p><br>

 


<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Balsam Garden</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>On the next day, the Holy Family continued their journey through a sandy, desolate wilderness. <br>
<sup>2</sup>Famishing for water and exhausted by weariness, they sat down on one of the sand hills, and the Blessed Virgin sent up a cry to God. <br>
<sup>3</sup>Suddenly, a stream of pure water gushed forth at her side. <br>
<sup>4</sup>Joseph removed the sand hill that was over it, and a clear, beautiful, little fountain jetted up. <br>
<sup>5</sup>He made a channel for it, and it flowed over quite a large space, disappearing again near its source. <br>
<sup>6</sup>Here they refreshed themselves, and Mary bathed the Child Jesus, while Joseph gave drink to the ass and filled the water bottles. <br>
<sup>7</sup>I saw all kinds of animals like turtles drinking at the gushing waters. <br>
<sup>8</sup>They did not appear at all afraid of the Holy Family.<br>
<sup>9</sup>The soil over which the water had flowed soon began to clothe itself with verdure, and numbers of balsam trees afterward grew there. <br>
<sup>10</sup>When the Holy Family returned from Egypt, those trees were large enough to furnish balsam for their refreshment. <br>
<sup>11</sup>The place soon grew into a little settlement. <br>
<sup>12</sup>Wherever the heathens planted these trees they withered. <br>
<sup>13</sup>They thrived only when the Jews whom the Holy Family had known in this country went to live there. <br>
<sup>14</sup>I think the wife of that robber whose boy had been cured of leprosy by the bath of the Child Jesus went there, too, for she soon escaped from the robbers. <br>
<sup>15</sup>Her boy, however, remained with them some time longer.<br>
<sup>16</sup>A balsam hedge surrounded the garden, and in its center were several large fruit trees. <br>
<sup>17</sup>At a subsequent period, another large well was dug, out of which quantities of water were raised by means of a wheel turned by oxen. <br>
<sup>18</sup>This water mingled with that of Mary’s spring and watered the whole garden; unmixed, it would have proved injurious. <br>
<sup>19</sup>I have seen that the oxen employed in turning the wheel could not by any means be forced to work from Saturday noon till early on Monday morning.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Holy Family Reach Heliopolis</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>I saw the Holy Family on their way to Heliopolis. <br>
<sup>2</sup>From their last night lodgings they were accompanied thither by a good man who, I think, was one of the workmen on that canal over which they had been ferried. <br>
<sup>3</sup>They now crossed a long and very high bridge over a wide river (the Nile), which appeared to have several branches, and came to a place before the city gate which was surrounded by a kind of promenade. <br>
<sup>4</sup>Here on a tapering pedestal, stood a great idol with the head of an ox, and in its arms something like the figure of a swathed child. <br>
<sup>5</sup>The idol was encom-passed by a circle of benches, or tables of stone upon which the worshippers laid their sacrifices. <br>
<sup>6</sup>Not far off was a very large tree, under which the Holy Family sat down to rest.<br>
<sup>7</sup>They had scarcely seated themselves when the earth began to quake, the idol tottered, and tilted over. <br>
<sup>8</sup>A hue and cry instantly arose from the people, and many of the workmen on the canal in the neighborhood came rushing up. <br>
<sup>9</sup>But the good man who had accompanied the Holy Family started with them for the city. <br>
<sup>10</sup>They were already at the opposite side of the idol place when the terrified crowd, with menacing and abusive words, angrily surrounded them. <br>
<sup>11</sup>Suddenly the earth heaved, the huge tree fell, its roots breaking up out of the ground, and there arose a lake of muddy water into which the idol splashed. <br>
<sup>12</sup>It sank so deep that one could scarcely see its horns, and some of the most wicked of the bystanders sank with it. <br>
<sup>13</sup>The Holy Family now entered the city unmolested, and put up near an idolatrous temple, a large stone building containing many rooms. <br>
<sup>14</sup>Some of the idols in the temples of the city were likewise overturned.<br>
<sup>15</sup>Heliopolis is also called On. <br>
<sup>16</sup>Aseneth, wife of the Egyptian Joseph, resided here with the pagan priest Putiphar, and here also Dionysius the Areopagite studied. <br>
<sup>17</sup>The city extends to a great distance around the many-branched river. <br>
<sup>18</sup>One sees it from afar lying high above the general level. <br>
<sup>19</sup>The river flows through it under the arches that support some of the buildings. <br>
<sup>20</sup>Great logs lie in some parts of the river branches, placed there to enable the inhabitants to cross. <br>
<sup>21</sup>I saw the ruins of enormous buildings, huge masses of heavy masonry, towers half standing, and even temples almost entire. <br>
<sup>22</sup>I saw, too, pillars like towers, around the outside of which one could mount to the top.<br>
<sup>23</sup>The Holy Family dwelt under a low colonnade, in which there were other dwellings besides their own. <br>
<sup>24</sup>The supporting pillars were rather low, some round, some square, and above ran a highway for the accommodation of vehicles and pedestrians. <br>
<sup>25</sup>Opposite this colonnade was a pagan temple with two courts. <br>
<sup>26</sup>Joseph put up before their little abode a screen of light woodwork. <br>
<sup>27</sup>There was room for the ass, also. <br>
<sup>28</sup>The screen, or light wall that Joseph put up, was of the same kind as he was accustomed to make. <br>
<sup>29</sup>I remarked behind a similar screen and set up against the wall, an altar consisting of a small table covered with red and over that a white, transparent cloth; on it stood a lamp.<br>
<sup>30</sup>I saw St. Joseph working at home, and often also abroad. <br>
<sup>31</sup>He made long rods with round knobs at the ends, little three-legged stools with a handle by which to grasp them, and a certain kind of basket. <br>
<sup>32</sup>He made, also, a great many light, wicker partitions, and little, light towers, some hexagonal, others octagonal. <br>
<sup>33</sup>They were formed of long, thin boards, tapering toward the top and ending in a knob. <br>
<sup>34</sup>They had an entrance, and were large enough to allow a man to sit inside as in a sentry box; they had steps outside, up which one could mount. <br>
<sup>35</sup>I saw little towers like these standing here and there before the pagan temples, also on the flat roofs of the houses. <br>
<sup>36</sup>People used to sit in them; perhaps they were watch houses, or maybe they were intended as screens from the sun.<br>
<sup>37</sup>I saw the Blessed Virgin weaving tapestry and doing another kind of work. <br>
<sup>38</sup>For the latter she used a staff on the top of which a knot was fastened. <br>
<sup>39</sup>I cannot say whether she was spinning or not. <br>
<sup>40</sup>I often saw people visiting her and the little Infant Jesus. <br>
<sup>41</sup>The Child lay on the ground by Mary’s side, in a kind of cradle like a little boat. <br>
<sup>42</sup>Sometimes I saw it raised on a frame like a sawing-jack. <br>
<sup>43</sup>There were not many Jews in Heliopolis, and I saw them going about with a downcast look as if they had no right to live there.<br>
<sup>44</sup>North of Heliopolis, between it and the Nile, which there divides into several branches, lay the little territory of Goshen, and in it a little place cut up by canals, among which dwelt numbers of Jews whose religious ideas were very much confused. <br>
<sup>45</sup>Several of them became acquainted with the Holy Family, and Mary did all kinds of feminine work for them, receiving as payment bread and other provisions. <br>
<sup>46</sup>The Jews in the Land of Goshen had a temple, which they compared with the Temple of Solomon; but it was very different.<br>
<sup>47</sup>Not far from his dwelling, Joseph built an oratory where the resident Jews, who possessed no such place of their own, used to assemble with the Holy Family for prayer. <br>
<sup>48</sup>It was surmounted by a light cupola which could be thrown open, thus enabling the worshippers to stand under the open sky. <br>
<sup>49</sup>In the center of the hall stood an altar, or table of sacrifice, covered, as usual, with red and white; on it lay rolls of parchment. <br>
<sup>50</sup>The priest, or teacher, was a very old man. <br>
<sup>51</sup>The men and women were not so separated from one another at prayer as in Palestine; the men stood on one side, the women on the other.<br>
<sup>52</sup>The Holy Family dwelt a little more than a year at Heliopolis. <br>
<sup>53</sup>They had much to suffer from the Egyptians who hated and persecuted them, on account of their overturned idols; and as the houses were all solidly built, Joseph could not find work at his trade. <br>
<sup>54</sup>They left Heliopolis, therefore, but not before they had learned from an angel of the slaughter of the Bethlehemite babes. <br>
<sup>55</sup>Both Mary and Joseph were deeply grieved, and the Child Jesus, who was now able to walk, being a year-and-a-half old, shed tears the whole day.</p><br>




<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Murder of The Innocent Children</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>I saw the mothers with their boys, from infants in the arms up to the age of two years, going to Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>2</sup>They were from those different places around the Holy City, in which Herod had placed garrisons and in which, by means of officials, he had issued a proclamation to that effect; viz. <br>
<sup>3</sup>from Bethlehem, Gilgal, and Hebron. <br>
<sup>4</sup>I saw many women even from the Arabian frontiers taking their children to Jerusalem, and these had more than a day’s journey to make. <br>
<sup>5</sup>The mothers went in bands, some with two children and riding on asses. <br>
<sup>6</sup>On their arrival in the city, they were all conducted to a large building, and the husbands who accompanied some of them dismissed. <br>
<sup>7</sup>The mandate was joyously obeyed, for the poor people imagined they were going to receive a reward.<br>
<sup>8</sup>The building into which the mothers and their children were ushered, was not far from the house occupied by Pilate at a later period. <br>
<sup>9</sup>It stood alone, and so encompassed by walls that no one outside could hear anything going on within. <br>
<sup>10</sup>A gateway through double walls led into a large court enclosed on all sides by buildings. <br>
<sup>11</sup>Those to the right and left were of one story; that in the middle, which looked like an old, deserted synagogue, was two stories in height. <br>
<sup>12</sup>From all three, doors opened into the court. <br>
<sup>13</sup>The middle building was a hall of justice, for I saw in the court before it a stone block, pillars with chains, and such trees as could be bound together by their branches and then suddenly snapped asunder, in order to tear people to pieces.<br>
<sup>14</sup>The mothers were led through the court and into the two side buildings, where they were shut up. <br>
<sup>15</sup>It looked to me at first as if they were in a sort of hospital, or lazar house. <br>
<sup>16</sup>When they saw themselves thus unexpectedly deprived of liberty, they began to fear, to cry, and to lament.<br>
<sup>17</sup>The lower story of the court of justice was a great hall like a prison, or guardroom; the upper one was also a large hall from which windows opened upon the court. <br>
<sup>18</sup>The officers of justice were assembled in the latter, rolls of writing lying before them on tables. <br>
<sup>19</sup>Herod himself was there. <br>
<sup>20</sup>He wore his crown and a purple mantle bordered with black and lined with white fur. <br>
<sup>21</sup>He stood at the windows with many others, looking down upon the slaughter of the Innocents.<br>
<sup>22</sup>The mothers, one by one, with their boys, were summoned from the side buildings into the great hall under the judgment hall. <br>
<sup>23</sup>On their entrance, the children were taken from them by the soldiers and carried out into the court where about twenty others were actively at work with swords and lances, piercing the little creatures through throat and heart. <br>
<sup>24</sup>Some of the children were still in swaddling clothes, infants in the mother’s arms; while others, able to run around, wore little woven dresses. <br>
<sup>25</sup>The soldiers did not remove the children’s clothing but, having pierced them through the heart and throat, they grasped them by one arm or leg and slung them together in a heap. <br>
<sup>26</sup>It was a terrible sight! The mothers were, one after another, pushed back into the large hall by the soldiers. <br>
<sup>27</sup>When the fate of their little ones dawned upon them, they raised a frightful cry, tore their hair, and clung to one another. <br>
<sup>28</sup>There were so many of them and, toward the last, they were so crowded together that they could scarcely stir. <br>
<sup>29</sup>I think the slaughter lasted till near evening. <br>
<sup>30</sup>The bodies of the murdered children were buried together in a great pit in the court. <br>
<sup>31</sup>I saw the mothers that night fettered, and taken back to their homes by the soldiers. <br>
<sup>32</sup>Similar scenes were enacted in other places, for the massacre was carried on during several days.<br>
<sup>33</sup>The number of the Holy Innocents was indicated to me by another number which sounded like and which I had to repeat until, I think, the whole amounted to seven hundred and seven, or seven hundred and seventeen.<br>
<sup>34</sup>The place of the children’s massacre in Jerusalem was the subsequent hall of justice, and not far from that of Pilate; but it was at his time very greatly changed. <br>
<sup>35</sup>At Christ’s death, I saw the pit in which the murdered children were buried, fall in. <br>
<sup>36</sup>Their souls appeared and left the place.<br>
<sup>37</sup>Elizabeth had fled with John into the desert. <br>
<sup>38</sup>After a long search, she found a cave, and there she remained with him for forty days. <br>
<sup>39</sup>After that, I saw that an Essenian belonging to the community on Mount Horeb and a relative of Anna the Prophetess, brought food to John, at first every eight, afterward every fourteen days, and otherwise provided for him. <br>
<sup>40</sup>Before Herod’s persecution, John could have been hidden in the neighborhood of his parents’ house; but he had made his escape into the desert impelled by divine inspiration. <br>
<sup>41</sup>He was destined to grow up in solitude, apart from intercourse with his fellow beings, and destitute of the customary nourishment of man. <br>
<sup>42</sup>I saw that that wilderness produced certain fruits, berries, and herbs.</p><br>



<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Holy Family Go to Matarea</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>The Holy Family left Heliopolis on account of the persecution they there endured and because Joseph could not obtain work. <br>
<sup>2</sup>They took byroads and went still further into the country, journeying southward toward Memphis. <br>
<sup>3</sup>Passing through a little town not far from Heliopolis, they halted in the forecourt of an open, pagan temple, and sat down to rest; when, all on a sudden, down tumbled the idol and fell to pieces. <br>
<sup>4</sup>It had the head of an ox with triple horns, and several cavities in the body to receive the sacrifices that were to be consumed. <br>
<sup>5</sup>At once arose a tumult among the pagan priests; they seized the Holy Family and threatened them with punishment. <br>
<sup>6</sup>But one of them represented to his companions, as they were consulting what measures to take, that the best thing for them to do would be to commend themselves to the God of these strangers; for he remembered, he said, what plagues had come upon their forefathers when they had persecuted those people, and that upon the night of their departure from Egypt the firstborn in every house had died. <br>
<sup>7</sup>These words were effectual, and the Holy Family was left in peace. <br>
<sup>8</sup>The pagan priest who had spoken for them went soon after to Matarea with several of his people, and there joined the Holy Family and the Jewish community.<br>
<sup>9</sup>Mary and Joseph next went to Troja, a place on the eastern side of the Nile, opposite Memphis. <br>
<sup>10</sup>It was large and very dirty. <br>
<sup>11</sup>They had some idea of remaining there, but they were not well received; indeed, they could get not even a drink of water, much less a few dates for which they begged. <br>
<sup>12</sup>Memphis lay west of the Nile, which was at that point very broad and contained some islands. <br>
<sup>13</sup>A part of the city lay also on this side of the river and, in Pharao’s time, a large palace with gardens and high towers, from which Pharao’s daughter often looked out on the country around. <br>
<sup>14</sup>I saw the spot upon which, among the tall bulrushes, the child Moses was found. <br>
<sup>15</sup>Memphis was like three cities in one, for it was built on both sides of the Nile, and appeared also to be connected with Babylon, a city lying eastward of the river and nearer to its mouth. <br>
<sup>16</sup>In Pharao’s time, the country in general around the Nile between Heliopolis, Babylon, and Memphis, was so covered with high stone dams and buildings, and so linked together by canals, that those three cities presented the appearance of one large city. <br>
<sup>17</sup>But at the time of the Holy Family, all were separate, immense wastes intervening between them.<br>
<sup>18</sup>The holy travelers proceeded northward from Troja along the river toward Babylon, a dirty, low lying city. <br>
<sup>19</sup>Between the Nile and Babylon, they took the route by which they had come and returned a distance of about two hours. <br>
<sup>20</sup>Buildings in ruins were scattered here and there along the whole road. <br>
<sup>21</sup>After crossing a small branch of the river, or a canal, they reached Matarea, which was built upon a tongue of land jutting out into the Nile. <br>
<sup>22</sup>The river bathed the city on two sides. <br>
<sup>23</sup>It was, in general, a wretched enough place, built only of date-wood and solid mud covered with rushes. <br>
<sup>24</sup>Joseph found plenty of work here. <br>
<sup>25</sup>He built more substantial houses of wickerwork with galleries around them, to which the occupants could go for air and recreation.<br>
<sup>26</sup>Here the Holy Family dwelt in a dark, vaulted cave that lay in a retired spot on the land side, not far from the gate by which they had entered. <br>
<sup>27</sup>Joseph, as at Heliopolis, built a light screen before it. <br>
<sup>28</sup>One of the idols in a little temple fell at their arrival and later all the others did the same. <br>
<sup>29</sup>The people were in consternation, but one of the priests quieted them by recalling to their remembrance the plagues of Egypt. <br>
<sup>30</sup>After some time, as a little community of Jews and converted pagans gathered around the Holy Family, the priests gave over to them the little temple whose idol had fallen at their coming, and Joseph turned it into a synagogue. <br>
<sup>31</sup>Joseph was like the patriarch of the community. <br>
<sup>32</sup>He taught them how to sing the Psalms correctly, for Judaism in those parts had greatly deteriorated.<br>
<sup>33</sup>Only the poorest Jews dwelt here in Babylon, and that in the most wretched dens and caves. <br>
<sup>34</sup>But in the Jewish settlement between On and the Nile, they were numerous and better off. <br>
<sup>35</sup>They had a regular temple, for they had lapsed into frightful idolatry. <br>
<sup>36</sup>They had a golden calf, a figure with an ox’s head, around which were ranged other representations of animals like polecats, or ferrets. <br>
<sup>37</sup>These last mentioned animals defend people against the crocodile. <br>
<sup>38</sup>They had, too, an imitation of the Ark of the Covenant and horrible things in it. <br>
<sup>39</sup>The idolatry they practiced was of the most shameful kind and, in a subterranean hall, they carried on the most infamous wickedness, deluded by the hope that from it their messiah should come forth. <br>
<sup>40</sup>They were exceedingly stiff-necked, and would not be converted. <br>
<sup>41</sup>Later on, however, many of them left that settlement and went to Babylon, about two hours distant. <br>
<sup>42</sup>In doing so, they could not, on account of the numerous dykes and canals, travel by a straight road; they had to make a detour around On.<br>
<sup>43</sup>These Jews of the Land of Goshen had already made the acquaintance of the Holy Family, while the latter abode in On. <br>
<sup>44</sup>Mary while there had done various kinds of work for them, such as knitting and embroidering covers and bands. <br>
<sup>45</sup>She would never undertake works for vanity or extravagance, but only useful things and religious vestments. <br>
<sup>46</sup>I saw women bringing work to her, which they wanted done in accordance with the requirements of vanity and fashion, and Mary returning it although so much in need of the pay she would have received for it. <br>
<sup>47</sup>The women mocked and scornfully derided her.<br>
<sup>48</sup>The Holy Family at first suffered greatly from want. <br>
<sup>49</sup>Good water could not be had and wood failed; the inhabitants used only dried grass and reeds for their cooking. <br>
<sup>50</sup>The Holy Family generally ate cold food. <br>
<sup>51</sup>Joseph had plenty to do. <br>
<sup>52</sup>He improved the poor huts for the people; but they treated him almost like a slave, giving him for his labor only what they themselves thought proper. <br>
<sup>53</sup>Sometimes he brought home something as a remuneration for his work, and sometimes he brought nothing. <br>
<sup>54</sup>The people were very unskillful in building their huts. <br>
<sup>55</sup>They had no wood, excepting here and there a log or two; and even if they had had wood, they had no tools to shape it, for they had only knives of bone or stone. <br>
<sup>56</sup>Joseph had brought the most necessary tools with him.<br>
<sup>57</sup>The Holy Family were soon settled somewhat comfortably. <br>
<sup>58</sup>They had little stools and tables, wicker screens, and a well-ordered fireplace also. <br>
<sup>59</sup>The Egyptians ate sitting flat on the ground. <br>
<sup>60</sup>In the wall of Mary’s sleeping place I saw a recess that Joseph had hollowed out, and in it was Jesus’ little bed. <br>
<sup>61</sup>Mary’s couch was beside it, and I have often seen her by night kneeling in prayer to God before that little bed. <br>
<sup>62</sup>Joseph slept in another enclosed corner.<br>
<sup>63</sup>The oratory of the Holy Family was in a passage outside. <br>
<sup>64</sup>Joseph and the Blessed Virgin had sepa-rate places in it and Jesus, too, had His little corner, where He prayed sitting, standing, or kneeling. <br>
<sup>65</sup>There was a kind of little altar before the Blessed Virgin’s place, a small table covered with red and white. <br>
<sup>66</sup>This table was like a leaf on hinges that could be let down from or put up against the wall. <br>
<sup>67</sup>When let down, it disclosed a shelf in the wall itself and on the shelf were various objects, among them something that was held as sacred. <br>
<sup>68</sup>I saw little bushes in pots formed like chalices; a withered, though still whole branch, on top of which was the lily that had blossomed in Joseph’s hand when he had been chosen by lot in the Temple for Mary’s spouse; and something like fine, thin, white sticks that were placed crosswise in the rounded part of the recess. <br>
<sup>69</sup>The blossoming lily branch was the top of Joseph’s staff; it was stuck in a box about one-and-a-half inches in diameter. <br>
<sup>70</sup>The little sticks that were arranged crosswise, were also in a box, a transparent one. <br>
<sup>71</sup>There were about five of those little white sticks of the thickness of a coarse straw. <br>
<sup>72</sup>They were crossed and bound in the middle to a kind of little sheaf. <br>
<sup>73</sup>But one pays very little attention to such things when in vision; one’s thoughts are chiefly intent upon the holy personages there presented.<br>
<sup>74</sup>I saw that the Holy Family had to subsist on fruits and bad water. <br>
<sup>75</sup>They had been so long without good water that Joseph resolved to saddle the ass, take his leathern bottle, and start for the balsam spring in the desert in order to get some. <br>
<sup>76</sup>But the Blessed Virgin was told in prayer by an angelic apparition that she should seek and find a spring at the back of their present abode. <br>
<sup>77</sup>I saw her going over the hill in which they dwelt, to a deep vacant lot that lay at some distance between ruined walls. <br>
<sup>78</sup>A large, old tree stood on that ground. <br>
<sup>79</sup>Mary had in her hand a rod provided with a little scoop, such as the people of that country commonly carryon journeys. <br>
<sup>80</sup>She stuck it into the ground near the tree, and a beautiful, clear stream of water instantly gushed forth. <br>
<sup>81</sup>She hurried back joyfully to call Joseph, who soon removed the upper crust of earth and disclosed a well which had long ago been dug out and lined with masonry, but which for some time had been choked up and dry. <br>
<sup>82</sup>He soon restored it and paved it around very beautifully with stones. <br>
<sup>83</sup>At the side of the well toward which Mary had approached, lay a great stone almost like an altar. <br>
<sup>84</sup>I think it was used for that purpose in former times.<br>
<sup>85</sup>The Blessed Virgin after that often washed Jesus’ clothes and bands here, and dried them in the sun. <br>
<sup>86</sup>The well remained unknown and was used only by the Holy Family until Jesus had grown large enough to go on little errands and even to bring water for His Mother. <br>
<sup>87</sup>Once I saw Him taking other children to the well and giving them a drink of the water which He scooped up in a hollow, crooked leaf. <br>
<sup>88</sup>The little ones told this to their parents, and so the well became known. <br>
<sup>89</sup>Others now began to go to it, though it remained principally in the use of the Jews. <br>
<sup>90</sup>Even in the time of the Holy Family, it possessed healing properties for the leprous. <br>
<sup>91</sup>Later, when a little chapel had been built over the dwelling of the Holy Family, there was near the high altar a flight of steps leading down to their first abode. <br>
<sup>92</sup>There I saw the spring. <br>
<sup>93</sup>It was surrounded by dwellings, and its waters used for the cure of leprosy and similar diseases. <br>
<sup>94</sup>Even the Turks kept a light burning in the little chapel, and dreaded being overtaken by some misfortune if they neglected it. <br>
<sup>95</sup>But the last I saw of the spring, it was lying solitary, surrounded only by trees.<br>
<sup>96</sup>I saw the Boy Jesus bringing water from the well for His Mother for the first time. <br>
<sup>97</sup>Mary was in prayer when the Boy slipped to the well with a bottle, and brought it back full of water. <br>
<sup>98</sup>Mary was unspeakably affected when she saw Him coming back with the water. <br>
<sup>99</sup>She knelt down and implored Him never to do that again, for He might fall into the well. <br>
<sup>100</sup>But Jesus replied that He would take care, and that He wanted to render her that service whenever she needed it. <br>
<sup>101</sup>If Joseph happened to be working at a little distance from home, and did he leave a tool lying behind him, I used to see the Boy Jesus running after it and bringing it to him. <br>
<sup>102</sup>The Boy noticed everything. <br>
<sup>103</sup>I think the joy that Mary and Joseph experienced on His account, must have outweighed all their sufferings. <br>
<sup>104</sup>Though perfectly childlike, He was very wise, skilled in everything; He knew and understood everything. <br>
<sup>105</sup>I often saw Mary and Joseph filled with unspeakable admiration.<br>
<sup>106</sup>When the Boy Jesus took to their owners the covers embroidered or woven by His Mother, who hoped to receive bread in return for her work, I often saw Him teased at first, and consequently sad. <br>
<sup>107</sup>But after awhile, the Holy Family was very much loved by the people. <br>
<sup>108</sup>I saw other children giving Jesus figs and dates, while many of their elders sought the Holy Family for help and consolation. <br>
<sup>109</sup>All in trouble said, “Let us go to the Jewish Child.”<br>
<sup>110</sup> I saw the Boy going on all kinds of errands, even to a Jewish town a mile distant, to get bread in exchange for His Mother’s work. <br>
<sup>111</sup>The wild animals, numerous on His route, did Him no harm; on the contrary, they and even the serpents showed Him affection. <br>
<sup>112</sup>Once I saw Him going with other children to the Jewish town; He was weeping bitterly over the degradation of the Jews.<br>
<sup>113</sup>When He went for the first time alone to that Jewish town, He wore, also for the first time, the brown robe woven by Mary. <br>
<sup>114</sup>It was trimmed around the border with yellowish flowers. <br>
<sup>115</sup>I saw Him kneeling and praying on the way. <br>
<sup>116</sup>Two angels appeared to Him and spoke of Herod’s death, but He said nothing of it to His parents.</p><br>





<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Return of the Holy Family from Egypt</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>I saw the Holy Family’s departure from Egypt. <br>
<sup>2</sup>Herod was long since dead, but danger still threat-ened and they could not return. <br>
<sup>3</sup>I saw St. Joseph, who was always busy at his trade, very much troubled one evening. <br>
<sup>4</sup>The people for whom he had been working had given him nothing; consequently, he had nothing to take home where there was so much need. <br>
<sup>5</sup>He knelt down in the open air and prayed. <br>
<sup>6</sup>He was greatly afflicted; his sojourn among these people was becoming intolerable. <br>
<sup>7</sup>They practiced infamous idolatry, even sacrificing deformed children. <br>
<sup>8</sup>The parent that sacrificed a healthy, well-formed child, was thought to be very pious. <br>
<sup>9</sup>They had, besides, still more shameful rites that they carried on in secret. <br>
<sup>10</sup>Even the Jews in the Jewish towns were to Joseph objects of horror.<br>
<sup>11</sup>While in his trouble he prayed to God for help, I saw an angel appear to him. <br>
<sup>12</sup>He bade him arise, and on the following morning depart from Egypt by the public high road. <br>
<sup>13</sup>He told him also not to fear, for that he would accompany him. <br>
<sup>14</sup>I saw Joseph hastening with the news to the Blessed Virgin and Jesus, and all setting to work to get their few movables packed together on the ass.<br>
<sup>15</sup>Next morning their intention to depart having become known, crowds of sorrowing neighbors came to them, bringing with them all kinds of gifts in little vessels of bark. <br>
<sup>16</sup>Several mothers brought their children. <br>
<sup>17</sup>There was among them a noble lady with a little boy of several years. <br>
<sup>18</sup>She called him Mary’s son, because having long abandoned the hope of having a boy, this child had been vouchsafed to her at Mary’s prayer. <br>
<sup>19</sup>She gave to the Boy Jesus triangular coins, yellow, white, and brown. <br>
<sup>20</sup>Jesus first looked at them and then at His Mother. <br>
<sup>21</sup>This lady’s little son was later on admitted by Jesus into the number of His disciples, and was named Deodatus. <br>
<sup>22</sup>The mother’s name was Mira.<br>
<sup>23</sup>The people of the place, of whom there were more pagans than Jews, were sincerely grieved at the Holy Family’s departure, though a few were glad. <br>
<sup>24</sup>These last looked upon them as sorcerers who obtained all they desired through the help of Lucifer, the prince of devils. <br>
<sup>25</sup>The Jews could no longer be recognized as Jews, so deeply were they sunk in idolatry.<br>
<sup>26</sup>The Holy Family started, accompanied by all their friends. <br>
<sup>27</sup>They took the direction between On and the Jewish town, turning away from On a little to the south, in order to reach the balsam garden. <br>
<sup>28</sup>They wanted to rest there awhile and replenish their water supply. <br>
<sup>29</sup>The garden was already flourishing. <br>
<sup>30</sup>The balsam trees were as tall as moderately large grapevines and in four rows surrounded the garden, which had an entrance. <br>
<sup>31</sup>There were sycamores and all kinds of fruit trees, some like dates. <br>
<sup>32</sup>The spring sent a stream around the whole garden. <br>
<sup>33</sup>The friends that had accompanied them here took leave, but the Holy Family remained for some hours. <br>
<sup>34</sup>Joseph had made some little vessels out of bark; they were covered with pitch, very smooth and nice. <br>
<sup>35</sup>He snapped from the reddish balsam twigs the clover-like leaves, and hung the flasks underneath, in order to gather the balsam drops for the journey. <br>
<sup>36</sup>When they stopped to rest, he often made, for their ordinary use, vessels and flasks of that kind out of bark. <br>
<sup>37</sup>The Blessed Virgin washed and dried some things here. <br>
<sup>38</sup>After having rested and refreshed themselves, they proceeded on their way by the common high road.<br>
<sup>39</sup>I had many visions of their journey, which was made without any special danger to them. <br>
<sup>40</sup>Mary was often very much distressed, because walking through the hot sand was so painful for the Boy Jesus. <br>
<sup>41</sup>Joseph had made for Him, out of bark, shoes that reached above the ankle where they were firmly fastened; still I saw the holy travelers frequently pausing while Mary shook the sand out of the Child’s shoes. <br>
<sup>42</sup>She herself wore only sandals. <br>
<sup>43</sup>Jesus was dressed in His little brown robe, and they often had to seat Him on the ass. <br>
<sup>44</sup>For protection against the scorching rays of the sun, all three wore very broad hats made of bark and fastened under the chin with a string.<br>
<sup>45</sup>I saw them passing by many cities, but I now recall only the name Ramses. <br>
<sup>46</sup>At last, I saw them in Gaza, where they stopped for three months. <br>
<sup>47</sup>There were many pagans in that city. <br>
<sup>48</sup>Joseph did not want to return to Nazareth, but to go to Bethlehem; still he was undecided, because he heard that Archelaus was now reigning over Judea, and he, too, was very cruel. <br>
<sup>49</sup>But an angel appeared and put an end to his doubts by telling him that he should return to Nazareth. <br>
<sup>50</sup>Anne was still living. <br>
<sup>51</sup>She and some of her relatives were the only ones that knew where the Holy Family were during all those years.<br>
<sup>52</sup>I had a glimpse of the Boy Jesus, now seven years old, as He walked between Mary and Joseph on their journey back to Judea from Egypt. <br>
<sup>53</sup>I did not see the ass with them then, and they were carrying their bundles themselves. <br>
<sup>54</sup>Joseph was about thirty years older than Mary. <br>
<sup>55</sup>I saw them on a road in the desert, about two hours’ distance from John’s cave. <br>
<sup>56</sup>The Boy Jesus, as He walked, gazed in that direction, and I saw that His soul was turning to John. <br>
<sup>57</sup>At the same time, I saw John at prayer in his cave. <br>
<sup>58</sup>An angel in the form of a boy appeared to him, telling him that the Saviour was passing by. <br>
<sup>59</sup>John ran out of the cave and, with outstretched arms, flew toward the point that his Saviour was passing. <br>
<sup>60</sup>He hopped about and danced with joy. <br>
<sup>61</sup>This vision was most touching. <br>
<sup>62</sup>John’s cave lay deeply buried in a hill. <br>
<sup>63</sup>It was not much wider than his own little bed, though it extended some distance in length. <br>
<sup>64</sup>The entrance was only a little opening, through which he used to swing himself out. <br>
<sup>65</sup>In the top was an oblique aperture that admitted light. <br>
<sup>66</sup>I saw in it a reed stand, upon which lay some honeycomb and dried locusts. <br>
<sup>67</sup>The latter were yellow and speckled, as large, perhaps, as crabs. <br>
<sup>68</sup>The desert in which Jesus fasted is four hours’ distance from here. <br>
<sup>69</sup>John was clothed in his camel’s skin. <br>
<sup>70</sup>The angel that appeared to him was like a boy of his own age. <br>
<sup>71</sup>I saw him at different periods, small at first and then larger, just as if he were growing up with John. <br>
<sup>72</sup>He was not always with him; he used to appear and disappear.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">John as a Child Growing Up In the Desert</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>John had already been long in the desert before the Holy Family’s return from Egypt. <br>
<sup>2</sup>That he had retired there at so young an age was due principally to divine inspiration and partly to his own inclinations, for he was of a meditative nature and loved solitude. <br>
<sup>3</sup>He was never in a school; the Holy Ghost Himself taught him in the desert. <br>
<sup>4</sup>He was much talked of even from his childhood, for the wonders attendant on his birth were known and a light was often seen around the child. <br>
<sup>5</sup>Herod soon laid snares for him, and even before the children’s massacre, Elizabeth was obliged to flee with him into the desert. <br>
<sup>6</sup>He could walk and help himself at the time. <br>
<sup>7</sup>He took refuge not far from the first cave of Magdalen, and Elizabeth visited him sometimes.<br>
<sup>8</sup>When in his sixth or seventh year, I saw him again led into the desert by his mother. <br>
<sup>9</sup>When Eliz-abeth left the house with the boy, Zachary was not home. <br>
<sup>10</sup>He loved John so much and his grief at losing him was so great that he was obliged to absent himself in order not to witness his departure. <br>
<sup>11</sup>He had, however, given him his blessing; for he was in the habit of blessing both mother and child whenever he left home. <br>
<sup>12</sup>John wore a garment of skin. <br>
<sup>13</sup>It passed from left to right over the shoulder and breast, was fastened under the right arm, and hung down behind. <br>
<sup>14</sup>This was his only garment. <br>
<sup>15</sup>His hair was brownish and darker than that of Jesus. <br>
<sup>16</sup>He bore in his hand a white staff which he had brought with him from home, and which he always kept in the desert.<br>
<sup>17</sup>I saw him as just described hastening across the country by the hand of his mother. <br>
<sup>18</sup>Elizabeth was a tall, active, old woman with a small, delicate face, and she was completely enveloped in a large mantle. <br>
<sup>19</sup>John often ran on before her, hopping and jumping, perfectly unrestrained and childlike in action, though not distracted in soul. <br>
<sup>20</sup>I saw them crossing a river. <br>
<sup>21</sup>There was no bridge at that point, and so they crossed on a raft that was floating on the water. <br>
<sup>22</sup>Elizabeth was a very resolute person, no difficulty daunted her; she herself rowed the raft across, using for that purpose the branch of a tree. <br>
<sup>23</sup>They now turned eastward and entered a ravine, rocky and desolate above, but lower down covered with bushes and overgrown with strawberries. <br>
<sup>24</sup>John now and then ate one. <br>
<sup>25</sup>After going some distance into the ravine, Elizabeth took leave of John. <br>
<sup>26</sup>She blessed him, pressed him to her heart, kissed him on the cheeks and forehead, and turned away, looking back at him as she retraced her steps, weeping. <br>
<sup>27</sup>But the boy appeared wholly unconcerned, and quietly walked on deeper into the ravine. <br>
<sup>28</sup>I followed the child with a feeling of uneasiness at his going so far from his mother, and fearing that he would not be able to find his way home again. <br>
<sup>29</sup>But just then, a voice said to me, “Be not uneasy. <br>
<sup>30</sup>The child knows well what he is about.”<br>
<sup>31</sup> I went with him and, in several visions, saw his whole after life in the desert. <br>
<sup>32</sup>He often told me himself how he denied himself in every way and mortified his senses, his understanding becoming clearer and clearer, learning in an unexplainable way something from everything around him. <br>
<sup>33</sup>I saw him when a child playing with flowers and animals. <br>
<sup>34</sup>The birds were particularly familiar with him. <br>
<sup>35</sup>They lighted upon his head when he was walking or praying, and perched upon his staff when he laid it across the branches. <br>
<sup>36</sup>There they sat in numbers, while he watched them and played with them. <br>
<sup>37</sup>I saw him also going after other animals, following them into their dens, feeding them, playing with them, or earnestly watching them.<br>
<sup>38</sup>At the opposite extremity of this rocky ravine, the country was somewhat more open, and John pressed on until he reached a little lake with a low shore covered with white sand. <br>
<sup>39</sup>I saw him there wading far out into the water. <br>
<sup>40</sup>The fish swam up and gathered around him; he seemed quite at home with them. <br>
<sup>41</sup>He lived in this region a long time, and I saw that he wove for himself out of branches a sleeping hut among the bushes. <br>
<sup>42</sup>It was very low and only large enough to allow him to lie in it.<br>
<sup>43</sup>Both here and afterward in other places, I often saw by him radiant figures, angels, with whom he treated fearlessly and confidently, though most reverently. <br>
<sup>44</sup>They appeared to be teaching him, directing his attention to different things. <br>
<sup>45</sup>He had fastened a piece of wood to his staff, thus giving it the form of a cross, also a strip of broad grass, or bark, or leaves like a little flag. <br>
<sup>46</sup>He often played with it, waving it here and there. <br>
<sup>47</sup>While he lived in this part of the desert, I saw his mother visiting him twice, but they did not meet at this spot. <br>
<sup>48</sup>He must have known when she was coming, for he always went some distance to meet her. <br>
<sup>49</sup>Elizabeth brought him a tablet with a slender reed for writing.<br>
<sup>50</sup>After his father’s death, John went secretly to Juttah, to console Elizabeth. <br>
<sup>51</sup>He remained concealed with her for some time. <br>
<sup>52</sup>She told him many things of Jesus and the Holy Family, some of which he noted down with strokes on his tablet. <br>
<sup>53</sup>Elizabeth wanted him to go with her to Nazareth, but he would not. <br>
<sup>54</sup>He returned again to the desert.<br>
<sup>55</sup>Once when Zachary had gone with a herd to the Temple, he was set upon by Herod’s soldiers and rudely maltreated in a narrow pass on the side of Jerusalem nearest to Bethlehem, at a spot whence the city could not be seen. <br>
<sup>56</sup>The soldiers dragged him into a prison on that side of Mount Zion by which, at a later period, the disciples used to ascend. <br>
<sup>57</sup>Zachary was frightfully maltreated, tortured, and at last pierced with a sword, because he would not disclose John’s retreat. <br>
<sup>58</sup>Elizabeth was at the time in the desert with John. <br>
<sup>59</sup>When she returned to Juttah, he accompanied her part of the way, and then went back to the desert. <br>
<sup>60</sup>On reaching Juttah, Elizabeth learned of the murder of her husband and great were her lamentations.<br>
<sup>61</sup>Zachary was buried by his friends in the vicinity of the Temple. <br>
<sup>62</sup>He is not that Zachary who was slain between the altar and the Temple and whom I saw at the time of the Crucifixion with the other risen dead. <br>
<sup>63</sup>He issued from that part of the wall in which the aged Simeon once had his cell for prayer, and walked about the Temple. <br>
<sup>64</sup>The last Zachary was murdered in a struggle that had taken place among many at the Temple, concerning the genealogy of the Messiah and certain privileges and places of individual families.<br>
<sup>65</sup>Elizabeth’s sorrow was so great that she could no longer bear to remain in Juttah, without John; consequently, she returned to him in the desert. <br>
<sup>66</sup>She soon after died there and was buried by an Essenian, a relative of Anna the Prophetess. <br>
<sup>67</sup>The house in Juttah, a very handsomely ordered one, was occupied by her sister’s daughter. <br>
<sup>68</sup>John secretly returned to it once after his mother’s death, after which he buried himself still deeper in the desert and thenceforth was altogether alone. <br>
<sup>69</sup>I saw him journeying to the south around the Dead Sea, then up the eastern side of the Jordan, from wilderness to wilderness toward Kedar and even toward Gessur. <br>
<sup>70</sup>When he passed from one wilderness to another, I saw him running through broad fields by night. <br>
<sup>71</sup>He went to that region where long after I saw John the Evangelist sitting and writing under the high trees. <br>
<sup>72</sup>Under those trees grew bushes with berries, of which he sometimes ate. <br>
<sup>73</sup>I saw him also eating a certain herb that bears a white flower and has five round leaves like clover. <br>
<sup>74</sup>We have at home herbs like them, only smaller. <br>
<sup>75</sup>They grow under the hedges, and the leaves have a sourish taste. <br>
<sup>76</sup>When I was a child I used to love to chew them while minding the cattle off in the solitary fields, because I had seen John eating them. <br>
<sup>77</sup>I also saw him drawing forth from holes in the trees and picking out of moss on the ground lumps of some brownish-looking stuff, which he ate. <br>
<sup>78</sup>I think it was wild honey, for it was very plentiful there. <br>
<sup>79</sup>The skin that he had brought with him from home, he now wore around his loins, and over his shoulders hung a brown, shaggy cover which he had woven himself. <br>
<sup>80</sup>There were in the desert wool-bearing animals which ran tamely around John, and camels with long hair on their neck. <br>
<sup>81</sup>They stood most patiently and allowed him to pull it out. <br>
<sup>82</sup>I saw him twisting the hair into cords and weaving from them that covering which he wore hanging around him when he appeared among men and baptized.<br>
<sup>83</sup>I saw him in continual and familiar communication with angels, by whom he was instructed. <br>
<sup>84</sup>He slept upon the hard rock and under the open sky, ran over rough stones through thorns and briers, disciplined himself with thistles, wore himself out working on trees and stones, and lay prostrate in prayer and contemplation. <br>
<sup>85</sup>He leveled roads, made little bridges, and changed the course of well springs. <br>
<sup>86</sup>I often saw him writing in the sand with a reed, kneeling and standing motionless in ecstasy, or praying with outstretched arms. <br>
<sup>87</sup>His penance and mortification became more and more severe, his prayer longer and more fervent. <br>
<sup>88</sup>He saw the Saviour only three times face to face with his bodily eyes. <br>
<sup>89</sup>But Jesus was with him in spirit; and John, who was constantly in the prophetic state, saw in spirit the actions of Jesus.<br>
<sup>90</sup>I saw John when full grown. <br>
<sup>91</sup>He was a powerful, earnest man. <br>
<sup>92</sup>He was standing by a dry well in the desert, and appeared to be in prayer. <br>
<sup>93</sup>A light hovered over him like a cloud, and it seemed to me as if it came from on high, from the water above the earth. <br>
<sup>94</sup>Then a light, shining stream fell over him into the basin below. <br>
<sup>95</sup>While gazing on this torrent, I saw John no longer at the edge of the basin; he was in it, the shining water flowing over him, and the basin filled by the sparkling stream. <br>
<sup>96</sup>Then again, I saw him, as at first, standing on the basin’s edge; but I did not see him out of it, nor coming out. <br>
<sup>97</sup>I think that the whole was perhaps a vision which John himself had had, and by which he was instructed to begin to baptize; or it may have been a spiritual baptism bestowed upon him in vision.</p><br>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Feast Picture of John the Baptist</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>I saw in the desert in which John dwelt a spiritual church rising up out of the waters that flowed in streams from on high, from Paradise, that floated in clouds, and welled up in fountains. <br>
<sup>2</sup>The church was immeasurably vast; it seemed to be symbolical of Baptism, and it grew with the baptized. <br>
<sup>3</sup>It was perfectly transparent like crystal. <br>
<sup>4</sup>An octagonal tower arose from the interior and reached up far out of sight. <br>
<sup>5</sup>Under it was a great fountain like the baptism fountain of John which he had formed in the desert after a model shown him in vision. <br>
<sup>6</sup>In the tower grew a genealogical tree upon which appeared John and his ancestors. <br>
<sup>7</sup>There was also an altar, and a wonderful representation of John’s conception, birth, circumcision, and life in the desert, of the baptism of Jesus and John’s beheading. <br>
<sup>8</sup>Far up in the tower, as if on a ladder reaching to Heaven, were seen in admirable order the whole host of Saints, the entire history of the Promise and the Redemption, and the abodes of the Blessed, endless in number. <br>
<sup>9</sup>High above all the rest hovered the Blessed Virgin in a mantle so wide as to cover all. <br>
<sup>10</sup>All these representations were white and transparent. <br>
<sup>11</sup>And now came immense crowds from all sides, kings and peoples in all kinds of costumes; they looked like nations that were migrating. <br>
<sup>12</sup>Many passed by the baptism church and went into the desert, where there is no water of life. <br>
<sup>13</sup>Many others entered the church and knelt down by the baptism fountain, by the side of which stood John under the appearance that he presented as a child in the desert. <br>
<sup>14</sup>He struck the water with his little staff and sprinkled it over them. <br>
<sup>15</sup>And, no matter how tall they were on entering the church, all that were thus sprinkled became small. <br>
<sup>16</sup>But many only passed in and out of the church. <br>
<sup>17</sup>They who had become little ones, like unto those that enter the Heavenly Kingdom, ascended the high, wonderful tower on the ladder that reached to Heaven. <br>
<sup>18</sup>There were at the baptism holy godparents. <br>
<sup>19</sup>The whole church, which appeared to be a building and still was formed of water, floated on high as if supported by a cord let down from Heaven.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Holy Family at Nazareth. Jesus at the Age of Twelve in The Temple of Jerusalem</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>There were three separate rooms in the house at Nazareth, that of the Mother of God being the largest and most pleasant; in it Jesus, Mary, and Joseph met to pray. <br>
<sup>2</sup>I very seldom saw them together at other times. <br>
<sup>3</sup>They stood at prayer, their hands crossed upon their breast, and they appeared to speak aloud. <br>
<sup>4</sup>I often saw them praying by a light. <br>
<sup>5</sup>They stood under a lamp that had several wicks, or near a kind of branched candlestick fastened to the wall, and upon which the flame burned. <br>
<sup>6</sup>They were most of the time alone in their respective rooms, Joseph working in his. <br>
<sup>7</sup>I saw him cutting sticks and laths, planing wood, and carrying up a beam, Jesus helping him. <br>
<sup>8</sup>Mary was generally engaged sewing or knitting with little needles, at which she sat on the ground, her feet crossed under her, and a little basket at her side. <br>
<sup>9</sup>They slept alone, each in a separate room. <br>
<sup>0</sup>The bed consisted of a cover which in the morning was rolled up.<br>
<sup>1</sup>I saw Jesus assisting His parents in every possible way, and also on the street and wherever oppor-tunity offered, cheerfully, eagerly, and obligingly helping everyone. <br>
<sup>2</sup>He assisted His foster-father in his trade, or devoted Himself to prayer and contemplation. <br>
<sup>3</sup>He was a model for all the children of Nazareth; they loved Him and feared to displease Him. <br>
<sup>4</sup>When they were naughty and committed faults, their parents used to say to them: “What will Joseph’s Son say when I tell Him this? How sorry He will be!” Sometimes they gently complained to Him before the little ones, saying; “Tell them not to do such or such a thing anymore.”<br>
<sup>5</sup>And Jesus took it playfully and like a little child. <br>
<sup>6</sup>He would beg the children affectionately to do so and so, would pray with them to His Heavenly Father for strength to become better, and would persuade them to acknowledge their faults and ask pardon on the spot.<br>
<sup>7</sup>About an hour’s journey from Nazareth toward Sephoris, is a little place called Ophna. <br>
<sup>8</sup>There, during the boyhood of Jesus, dwelt the parents of James the Greater and of John. <br>
<sup>9</sup>In those early years, they associated with Jesus, until their parents removed to Bethsaida and they themselves went to the fishery.<br>
<sup>0</sup>There lived in Nazareth an Essenian family related to Joachim. <br>
<sup>1</sup>They had four sons, a few years older or younger than Jesus, named respectively, Cleophas, James, Judas, and Japhet. <br>
<sup>2</sup>They, too, were playmates of Jesus, and with their parents were in the habit of making the journey to the Temple along with the Holy Family. <br>
<sup>3</sup>These four brothers became, at the time of Jesus’ baptism, disciples of John, and after his murder, disciples of Jesus. <br>
<sup>4</sup>When Andrew and Saturnin crossed the Jordan to Jesus, they followed them and spent the whole day with Him. <br>
<sup>5</sup>They were among those disciples of John whom Jesus took with Him to the marriage feast at Cana. <br>
<sup>6</sup>Cleophas is the same to whom, in company with Luke, Jesus appeared at Emmaus. <br>
<sup>7</sup>He was married and dwelt at Emmaus. <br>
<sup>8</sup>His wife afterward joined the women of the Community.<br>
<sup>9</sup>Jesus was tall and slender with a delicate face and a beaming countenance and though pale, He was healthy-looking. <br>
<sup>0</sup>His perfectly straight, golden hair was parted over His high, open forehead and fell upon His shoulders. <br>
<sup>1</sup>He wore a long, light-brownish gray tunic, which reached to His feet, the sleeves rather wide around the hand.<br>
<sup>2</sup>At the age of eight years, Jesus went for the first time with His parents to Jerusalem for the Pasch, and every succeeding year He did the same.<br>
<sup>3</sup>In those first visits, Jesus had already excited attention in Jerusalem among the friends with whom He and His parents stayed, also among the priests and doctors. <br>
<sup>4</sup>They spoke of the pious, intelligent Child, of Joseph’s extraordinary Son, just as amongst us one might, at the annual pilgrimages, notice in particular this or that modest, holy-looking person, this or that clever peasant child, and recognize him again the next year. <br>
<sup>5</sup>So Jesus had already some acquaintances in the city when, in His twelfth year, with their friends and their sons, He accompanied His parents to Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>6</sup>His parents were accustomed to walk with the people from their own part of the country, and they knew that Jesus, who now made the journey for the fifth time, always went with the other youths from Nazareth.<br>
<sup>7</sup>But this time Jesus had, on the return journey not far from the Mount of Olives, separated from His companions, who all thought that He had joined His parents who were following. <br>
<sup>8</sup>Jesus had, however, gone to that side of Jerusalem nearest to Bethlehem, to the inn at which the Holy Family before Mary’s Purification had put up. <br>
<sup>9</sup>Mary and Joseph thought Him on ahead with the other Nazarenes, while these latter thought that He was following with His parents. <br>
<sup>0</sup>When at last they all met at Gophna, the anxiety of Mary and Joseph at His absence was very great. <br>
<sup>1</sup>They returned at once to Jerusalem, making inquiries after Him on the way and everywhere in the city itself. <br>
<sup>2</sup>But they could not find Him, since He had not been where they usually stayed. <br>
<sup>3</sup>Jesus had slept at the inn before the Bethlehem gate, where the people knew Him and His parents.<br>
<sup>4</sup>There He had joined several youths and gone with them to two schools of the city, the first day to one, the second to another. <br>
<sup>5</sup>On the morning of the third day, He had gone to a third school at the Temple, and in the afternoon into the Temple itself where His parents found Him. <br>
<sup>6</sup>These schools were all different, and not all exactly schools of the Law. <br>
<sup>7</sup>Other branches were taught in them. <br>
<sup>8</sup>The last mentioned was in the neighborhood of the Temple and from it the Levites and priests were chosen.<br>
<sup>9</sup>Jesus by His questions and answers so astonished and embarrassed the doctors and rabbis of all these schools that they resolved, on the afternoon of the third day, in the public lecture hall of the Temple and in presence of the rabbis most deeply versed in the various sciences “to humble the Boy Jesus.”<br>
<sup>0</sup> The scribes and doctors had concerted the plan together; for, although pleased at first, they had in the end become vexed at Him. <br>
<sup>1</sup>They met in the public lecture hall in the middle of the Temple porch in front of the Sanctuary, in the round place where later Jesus also taught. <br>
<sup>2</sup>There I saw Jesus sitting in a large chair which He did not, by a great deal, fill. <br>
<sup>3</sup>Around Him was a crowd of aged Jews in priestly robes. <br>
<sup>4</sup>They were listening attentively, and appeared to be perfectly furious. <br>
<sup>5</sup>I feared they would lay hands upon Him. <br>
<sup>6</sup>On the top of the chair in which Jesus was sitting, were brown heads like those of dogs. <br>
<sup>7</sup>They were greenish brown, the upper parts glistening and sparkling with a yellow light. <br>
<sup>8</sup>There were similar heads and figures upon several long tables, or benches, that stood in the Temple sideways from this place, covered with offerings. <br>
<sup>9</sup>The place was very large and so crowded that one could scarcely imagine himself in a church.<br>
<sup>0</sup>As Jesus had in the schools illustrated His answers and explanations by all kinds of examples from nature, art, and science, the scribes and doctors had diligently gathered together masters in all these branches. <br>
<sup>1</sup>They now began, one by one, to dispute with Him. <br>
<sup>2</sup>He remarked that although, properly speaking, such subjects did not appear appropriate to the Temple, yet He would discuss them since such was His Father’s will. <br>
<sup>3</sup>But they understood not that He referred to His Heavenly Father; they imagined that Joseph had commanded Him to show off His learning.<br>
<sup>4</sup>Jesus now answered and taught upon medicine. <br>
<sup>5</sup>He described the whole human body in a way far beyond the reach of even the most learned. <br>
<sup>6</sup>He discoursed with the same facility upon astronomy, architecture, agriculture, geometry, arithmetic, jurisprudence and, in fine, upon every subject proposed to Him. <br>
<sup>7</sup>He applied all so skillfully to the Law and the Promise, to the Prophecies, to the Temple, to the mysteries of worship and sacrifice that His hearers, surprised and confounded, passed successively from astonishment and admiration to fury and shame. <br>
<sup>8</sup>They were enraged at hearing some things that they never before knew, and at hearing others that they had never before understood.<br>
<sup>9</sup>Jesus had been teaching two hours, when Joseph and Mary entered the Temple. <br>
<sup>0</sup>They inquired after their Child of the Levites whom they knew, and received for answer that He was with the doctors in the lecture hall. <br>
<sup>1</sup>But as they were not at liberty to enter that hall, they sent one of the Levites in to call Jesus. <br>
<sup>2</sup>Jesus sent them word that He must first finish what He was then about. <br>
<sup>3</sup>Mary was very much troubled at His not obeying at once, for this was the first time He had given His parents to understand that He had other commands than theirs to fulfill. <br>
<sup>4</sup>He continued to teach for another hour, and then He left the hall and joined His parents in the porch of Israel, the women’s porch, leaving His hearers confounded, confused, and enraged. <br>
<sup>5</sup>Joseph was quite awed and astonished, but he kept a humble silence. <br>
<sup>6</sup>Mary, however, drawing near to Jesus, said, “Child, why hast Thou done this to us? Behold, Thy father and I have sought Thee sorrowing!” But Jesus answered gravely, “Why have you sought Me? Do you not know that I must be about My Father’s business?” But they did not understand. <br>
<sup>7</sup>They at once began with Him their journey home. <br>
<sup>8</sup>The bystanders gazed at them in astonishment, and I was in dread lest they should lay hands upon the Boy, for I saw that some of them were full of rage. <br>
<sup>9</sup>I wondered at their allowing the Holy Family to depart so peaceably. <br>
<sup>0</sup>Although the crowd was dense, yet a wide path was made to permit the Holy Family to pass. <br>
<sup>1</sup>I saw all the details and heard almost the whole of Jesus’ teaching, but I cannot remember all. <br>
<sup>2</sup>It made a great impression upon the scribes. <br>
<sup>3</sup>Some recorded the affair as a notable event, while here and there it was whispered around, giving rise to all kinds of remarks and false reports. <br>
<sup>4</sup>But the true statement, the scribes kept to themselves. <br>
<sup>5</sup>They spoke of Jesus as of a very forward boy, possessed indeed of fine talents, but said those talents required to be cultivated.<br>
<sup>6</sup>I saw the Holy Family again leaving the city, outside of which they joined a party of about three men, two women, and some children. <br>
<sup>7</sup>I did not know them, but they appeared to be from Nazareth. <br>
<sup>8</sup>They went together to different places around Jerusalem, also to Mount Olivet. <br>
<sup>9</sup>They wandered around the beautiful pleasure grounds there found, occasionally standing to pray, their hands crossed on their breast. <br>
<sup>0</sup>I saw them also going over a bridge that spanned a brook. <br>
<sup>1</sup>This walking around and praying of the little party reminded me forcibly of a pilgrimage.<br>
<sup>2</sup>When Jesus had returned to Nazareth, I saw a feast in Anne’s house, at which were gathered all the youths and maidens among their friends and relatives. <br>
<sup>3</sup>I know not whether it was a feast of rejoicing at Jesus’ having been found, a feast solemnized upon the return from the Paschal journey, or a feast customary upon the completion of a son’s twelfth year. <br>
<sup>4</sup>Whatever it may have been, Jesus appeared to be the object of it.<br>
<sup>5</sup>Beautiful bowers were erected over the table, from which hung garlands of vine leaves and ears of corn. <br>
<sup>6</sup>The children were served with grapes and little rolls. <br>
<sup>7</sup>There were present at this feast thirty-three boys, all future disciples of Jesus, and I received an instruction upon the years of Jesus’ life. <br>
<sup>8</sup>During the whole feast, Jesus instructed the other boys, and explained to them a very wonderful parable which, however, was only imperfectly understood. <br>
<sup>9</sup>It was of a marriage feast at which water could be turned into wine and the lukewarm guests into zealous friends; and again, of a marriage feast where the wine could be changed into Blood and the bread into Flesh, which Blood and Flesh would abide with the guests until the end of the world as strength and consolation, as a living bond of union. <br>
<sup>0</sup>He said also to one of the youths, a relative of His own named Nathanael: “I shall be present at thy marriage.”<br>
<sup></sup>From His twelfth year, Jesus was always like a teacher among His companions. <br>
<sup></sup>He often sat among them instructing them or walked about the country with them.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Death of St. Joseph. Jesus and Mary in Capharnaum</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>As the time drew near for Jesus to begin His mission of teaching, I saw Him ever more solitary and meditative; and toward the same time, the thirtieth year of Jesus, Joseph began to decline. <br>
<sup>2</sup>I saw Jesus and Mary often with him. <br>
<sup>3</sup>Mary sometimes sat on the ground by his couch, or upon a low, round three legged stool, which served also for a table. <br>
<sup>4</sup>I seldom saw them eating; but when they did, or brought some refreshment to Joseph’s bedside, it consisted of three, white, rather long, four-cornered pieces, about two fingers in breadth, that lay side by side on a little plate, and I saw also some little fruits in a dish. <br>
<sup>5</sup>They gave him something to drink out of a mug.<br>
<sup>6</sup>When Joseph was dying, Mary sat at the head of his bed, holding him in her arms. <br>
<sup>7</sup>Jesus stood just below her near Joseph’s breast. <br>
<sup>8</sup>The whole room was brilliant with light and full of angels. <br>
<sup>9</sup>After his death, his hands were crossed on his breast, he was wrapped from head to foot in a white winding sheet, laid in a narrow casket, and placed in a very beautiful tomb, the gift of a good man. <br>
<sup>0</sup>Only a few men followed the coffin with Jesus and Mary; but I saw it accompanied by angels and environed with light. <br>
<sup>1</sup>Joseph’s remains were afterward removed by the Christians to Bethlehem, and interred. <br>
<sup>2</sup>I think I can still see him lying there incorrupt.<br>
<sup>3</sup>Joseph had of necessity to die before the Lord, for he could not have endured His Crucifixion; he was too gentle, too loving. <br>
<sup>4</sup>He had already suffered much from the persecution Jesus had had to support from the malice of the Jews from His twentieth to His thirtieth year; for they could not bear the sight of Him. <br>
<sup>5</sup>Their jealousy often made them exclaim that the carpenter’s Son thought He knew everything better than others, that He was frequently at variance with the teachings of the Pharisees, and that He always had around Him a crowd of young followers.<br>
<sup>6</sup>Mary never ceased to suffer from these persecutions. <br>
<sup>7</sup>Such pains always seem to me sharper than those of martyrdom. <br>
<sup>8</sup>Unspeakable was the love with which Jesus in His youth bore the jealous persecution of the Jews.<br>
<sup>9</sup>After Joseph’s death, Jesus and Mary removed to a little village of only a few houses between Capharnaum and Bethsaida. <br>
<sup>0</sup>A man named Levi, who was very much attached to the Holy Family, had given Jesus a house there in which to dwell. <br>
<sup>1</sup>It stood alone surrounded by a ditch of standing water. <br>
<sup>2</sup>A couple of Levi’s people also were in the house in the capacity of servants, and Levi himself supplied all necessaries from Capharnaum. <br>
<sup>3</sup>It was to this little place that Peter’s father retired when he gave over to him the fishery at Bethsaida.<br>
<sup>4</sup>Jesus had already many followers among the young people of Nazareth, but they were not faithful to Him. <br>
<sup>5</sup>He walked with them in the country around the lake and went up to Jerusalem with them for the feasts. <br>
<sup>6</sup>The Lazarus family in Bethania were already acquainted with the Holy Family. <br>
<sup>7</sup>The Pharisees of Nazareth were against Jesus; they called Him a vagrant. <br>
<sup>8</sup>Levi gave Him that house that He might, without fear of disturbance, live in it and gather His followers around Him.<br>
<sup>9</sup>There was on the lake around Capharnaum, a region of extraordinarily fertile and charming valleys. <br>
<sup>0</sup>There were several harvests during the year, and uncommonly beautiful leaves, blossoms, and fruits—all at the same time. <br>
<sup>1</sup>Many distinguished Jews had gardens and castles there, Herod among the number. <br>
<sup>2</sup>The Jews of Jesus’ time were no longer like their fathers; through commerce and their intercourse with heathens, they had become very corrupt. <br>
<sup>3</sup>One never saw the women in public nor at work in the fields, excepting the very poorest gleaning some ears of corn. <br>
<sup>4</sup>They were to be seen only on pilgrimages to Jerusalem and other holy places. <br>
<sup>5</sup>Husbandry and all kinds of traffic were carried on mostly through slaves. <br>
<sup>6</sup>I have seen all the cities of Galilee. <br>
<sup>7</sup>Where now scarcely three villages are in existence, there were then almost a hundred and an innumerable crowd of people.<br>
<sup>8</sup>Mary Cleophas, who with her third husband, the father of Simeon of Jerusalem, dwelt in Anne’s house near Nazareth, afterward removed with her boy Simeon to Mary’s in Nazareth. <br>
<sup>9</sup>The rest of her family and her servants remained at Anne’s.<br>
<sup>0</sup>When Jesus, a short time after, went from Capharnaum by way of Nazareth to the region of Hebron, He was accompanied by Mary as far as Nazareth, where she awaited His return. <br>
<sup></sup>She was always so solicitous about Him. <br>
<sup></sup>There came also to comfort the Holy Family on the death of St. <br>
<sup></sup>Joseph and to see Jesus again, Joses Barsabas, the son of Mary Cleophas by her second marriage with Sabas, and the three sons of her first marriage with Alpheus: Simon, James the Less, and Thaddeus, all three of whom already carried on business away from home. <br>
<sup></sup>They had had no close communication with Jesus since His childhood. <br>
<sup></sup>They knew in general of Simeon’s and Anne’s prophecies on the occasion of His Presentation in the Temple, but they attached no importance to them. <br>
<sup></sup>They preferred to follow John the Baptist, who soon after passed through these parts.</p><br>
