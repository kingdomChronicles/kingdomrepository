        <!-------------------------------START OF LESSON 1  ------------------------------->
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Eve Conceived Cain then Abel</p>
              
                    <p><sup>1</sup> This is the story of Adam and Eve after they had gone out of Paradise. </p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And Adam knew his wife Eve and went upwards to the sun-rising and abode there eighteen years and two months.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And Eve conceived and bare two sons; Adiaphotos, who is called Cain and Amilabes who is called Abel.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Dream of Eve</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And after this, Adam and Eve were with one another and while they were sleeping, 
                        Eve said to Adam her lord: </p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> 'My lord, Adam, behold, I have seen in a dream this night the blood of my son Amilabes who is styled Abel 
                        being poured into the mouth of Cain his brother and he went on drinking it without pity.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> But he begged him to leave him a little of it. Yet he hearkened not to him, but gulped down the whole; nor did it stay in his stomach, 
                        but came out of his mouth.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And Adam said, 'Let us arise and go and see what has happened to them. (I fear) lest the adversary may be assailing 
                        them somewhere.'</p>

        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Murder of Abel</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And they both went and found Abel murdered. I by the hand of Cain his brother.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And God saith to Michael the archangel: 'Say to Adam: " Reveal not the secret that thou knowest to Cain thy son, for he is a son of wrath. But grieve not, for I will give thee another son in his stead; he shall show (to thee) all that thou shalt do. Do thou tell him nothing."'</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> Thus spake the archangel to Adam. But he kept the word in his heart, and with him also Eve, though they grieved concerning Abel their son.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Birth of Seth</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And after this, Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bare Seth.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And Adam said to Eve: 'See! we have begotten a son in place of Abel, whom Cain slew, let us give glory and sacrifice to God.'</p>
            
        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Adam Felt His Forthcoming Death</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And Adam begat thirty sons and thirty daughters and Adam lived nine hundred and thirty years;</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> and he fell sick and cried with a loud voice and said, 'Let all my sons come to me that I may see them before I die.'</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And all assembled, for the earth was divided into three parts. And Seth his son said to him:</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> 'Father Adam, what is thy complaint?'</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And he saith, 'MY children, I am crushed by the burden of trouble.' And they say to him, 'What is trouble?'</p>

        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Seth Offered Adam Help</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And Seth answered and said to him: 'Hast thou called to mind, father, the fruit of paradise of which thou usedst to eat, and hast been grieved in yearning for it?'</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> 'If this be so, tell me, (and) I will go and bring thee fruit from paradise. For I will set dung upon my head and will weep and pray that the Lord will hearken to me and send his angel (and bring me a plant from paradise), and I will bring it thee that thy trouble may cease from thee.' Adam saith to him: 'Nay, my son Seth, but</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> I have (much) sickness and trouble!' Seth saith to him: 'And how hath this come upon thee?'</p>
             
        <h2 id="BOAFOM7">Chapter 7</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Adam Told the Story How They was Tricked</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And Adam said to him: 'When God made us, me and your mother, through whom also I die, He gave us power to eat of every tree which is in paradise, but, concerning that one only, He charged us not to eat of it, and through this one we are to die.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And the hour drew nigh for the angels who were guarding your mother to go up and worship the Lord, and I was far from her, and the enemy knew that she was alone and gave to her, and she ate of the tree of which she had been told not to eat.</p>    
                    <p><sup>3</sup> Then she gave also to me to eat.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Seventy-Two Strokes of Pain</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> 'And God was wroth with us, and the Lord came into paradise and called me in a terrible voice and said: 
                      "Adam, where art thou? And why hidest thou from my face? Shall the house be able to hide itself from its builder?" 
                      And he saith to me: "Since thou hast abandoned my covenant, I have brought upon thy body seventy-two strokes; 
                      the trouble of the first stroke is a pain of the eyes, the second stroke an affection of the hearing, 
                      and likewise in turn all the strokes shall befall thee."'</p>

        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Eve Asked Adam Half of Adam's Trouble</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> As he said this to his sons, Adam groaned sore and said: 'What shall I do? I am in great distress.'
                        And Eve wept and said:</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> 'My lord Adam, rise up and give me half of thy trouble and I will endure it; for it is on my account that 
                        this hath happened to thee, on my account thou art beset with toils and troubles.'</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> But Adam said to Eve, 'Arise and go with my son Seth near to paradise, and put earth upon your heads and 
                        weep and pray God to have mercy upon me and send his angel to paradise, and give me of the tree out 
                        of which the oil floweth, and bring it me, and I shall anoint myself and shall have rest from my complaint.'</p>

        <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Beast Came After Seth</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> Then Seth and Eve went towards paradise, and Eve saw her son, and a wild beast assailing him, 
                        and Eve wept and said:</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> 'Woe is me; if I come to the day of the Resurrection, all those who have sinned will curse me saying: 
                        Eve hath not kept the commandment of God.'</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And she spake to the beast: 'Thou wicked beast, fearest thou not to fight with the image of God? 
                        How was thy mouth opened? How were thy teeth made strong?</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> How didst thou not call to mind thy subjection? For long ago wast thou made subject to the image of God.' Then the beast cried out and said:</p>


        <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Beast's Reply Against Eve</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> 'It is not our concern, Eve, thy greed and thy wailing, but thine own; for (it is) from thee that the rule of the beasts hath arisen.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup>  How was thy mouth opened to eat of the tree concerning which God enjoined thee not to eat of it? On this account, our nature also hath been transformed.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> Now therefore thou canst not endure it, if I begin to reprove thee.'</p>

        <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Seth Rebuked on the Beast</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> Then Seth speaketh to the beast, 'Close thy mouth and be silent and stand off from 
                      the image of God until the day of Judgment.'</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup>  Then saith the beast to Seth: 'Behold, I stand off from the image of God.' And he went to his lair.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">God Promised the Ressurection of the Righteous</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And Seth went with Eve near paradise, and they wept there, and prayed God to send his angel 
                        and give them the oil of mercy.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And God sent the archangel Michael and he spake to Seth: 'Seth, man of God, weary not thyself with prayers 
                        and entreaties concerning the tree which floweth with oil to anoint thy father Adam. For it shall not be thine now, but in the end of the times.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> Then shall all flesh be raised up from Adam till that great day,-all that shall be of the holy people. 
                        Then shall the delights of paradise be given to them and God shall be in their midst. And they shall no longer sin before his face, for the evil heart shall be taken from them and there shall be given them a heart understanding the good and to serve God only.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> But do thou go back to thy father. For the term of his life hath been fulfilled and he will live three days from to-day and will die. But when his soul is departing, thou shalt behold the awful (scene of) his passing.'</p>

        <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Adam Reminded Eve the Effect of their Transgression</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> Thus spake the angel and departed from them. And Seth and Eve came to the hut where Adam was laid. And Adam saith to Eve: </p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> 'Eve, what hast thou wrought in us? Thou hast brought upon us great wrath which is death, [lording it over all our race].'</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And he saith to her, 'Call all our children and our children's children and tell them the manner of our transgression.'</p>


        <h2 id="BOAFOM15">Chapter 15</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Eve Relate to Her Children How the Enemy Deceived Them</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> Then saith Eve to them: 'Hear all my children and children's children and I will relate to you how the enemy deceived us.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> It befell that we were guarding paradise, each of us the portion allotted to us from God.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> Now I guarded in my lot, the west and the south. But the devil went to Adam's lot, where the male creatures were. [For God divided the creatures; all the males he gave to your father and all the females he gave to me.]</p>

        <h2 id="BOAFOM16">Chapter 16</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Devil's Offer to the Serpent</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And the devil spake to the serpent saying, Rise up, come to me and I will tell thee a word whereby thou mayst have profit."</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And he arose and came to him. And the devil saith to him: "I hear that thou art wiser than all the beasts, and I have come to counsel thee.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> Why dost thou eat of Adam's tares and not of paradise? Rise up and we will cause him to be cast out of paradise, even as we were cast out through him."</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> The serpent saith to him, "I fear lest the Lord be wroth with me." </p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> The devil saith to him: "Fear not, only be my vessel and I will speak through thy mouth words to deceive him."</p>

        <h2 id="BOAFOM17">Chapter 17</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Devil's Conversation with Eve</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And instantly he hung himself from the wall of paradise, and when the angels ascended to worship God, then Satan appeared in the form of an angel and sang hymns like the angels.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And I bent over the wall and saw him, like an angel. But he saith to me: "Art thou Eve?"</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And I said to him, "I am." 'What art thou doing in paradise?" And I said to him, "God set us to guard and to eat of it."</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> The devil answered through the mouth of the serpent: 'Ye do well but ye do not eat of every plant."</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And I said: "Yea, we eat of all, save one only, which is in the midst of paradise, concerning which, God charged us not to eat of it: for, He said to us, on the day on which ye eat of it, ye shall die the death."
                    </p>

        <h2 id="BOAFOM18">Chapter 18</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">How The Devil Convince Eve</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> Then the serpent saith to me, "May God live! but I am grieved on your account, for I would not have you ignorant. But arise, (come) hither, hearken to me and eat and mind the value of that tree."</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> But I said to him, " I fear lest God be wroth with me as he told us." And he saith to me: </p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> "Fear not, for as soon as thou eatest of it, ye too shall be as God, in that ye shall know good and evil.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> But God perceived this that ye would be like Him, so he envied you and said, Ye shall not eat of it.</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> Nay, do thou give heed to the plant and thou wilt see its great glory." Yet I feared to take of the fruit. </p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And he saith to me: "Come hither, and I will give it thee. Follow me."</p>

        <h2 id="BOAFOM19">Chapter 19</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Eve's Oath to the Devil</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And I opened to him and he walked a little way, then turned and said to me:</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> "I have changed my mind and I will not give thee to eat until thou swear to me to give also to thy husband." (And) I said. "What sort of oath shall I swear to thee? Yet what I know, I say to thee: By the throne of the Master, and by the Cherubim and the Tree of Life! I will give also to my husband to eat."</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And when he had received the oath from me, he went and poured upon the fruit the poison of his wickedness, 
                        which is lust, the root and beginning of every sin, and he bent the branch on the earth and I took of the 
                        fruit and I ate.</p>

        <h2 id="BOAFOM20">Chapter 20</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Eve's Transgression</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And in that very hour my eyes were opened, and forthwith I knew that I was bare of the righteousness with which I had been clothed (upon),</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> and I wept and said to him: "Why hast thou done this to me in that thou hast deprived me of the glory with which I was clothed?"</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> But I wept also about the oath, which I had sworn. But he descended from the tree and vanished.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And I began to seek, in my nakedness, in my part for leaves to hide my shame, but I found none, for, 
                        as soon as I had eaten, the leaves showered down from all the trees in my part,</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> except the fig tree only. But I took leaves from it and made for myself a girdle and it was from the very same plant of which I had eaten.</p>

        <h2 id="BOAFOM21">Chapter 21</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Devil Spoke through Eve</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And I cried out in that very hour, 'Adam, Adam, where art thou? Rise up, come to me and I will show thee a great secret."</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> But when your father came, I spake to him words of transgression [which have brought us down from our great glory].</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> For, when he came, I opened my mouth and the devil was speaking, and I began to exhort him and said, "Come hither, my lord Adam, hearken to me and eat of the fruit of the tree of which God told us not to eat of it, and thou shalt be as a God.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> " And your father answered and said, "I fear lest God be wroth with me."</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup>  And I said to him, "Fear not, for as soon as thou hast eaten thou shalt know good and evil." And speedily I persuaded him, and he ate and straightway his eyes were opened and he too knew his nakedness.</p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And to me he saith, "O wicked woman! what have I done to thee that thou hast deprived me of the glory of God?"</p>

        <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Archangel Michael Announces God's Judgement</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And in that same hour, we heard the archangel Michael blowing with his trumpet and calling to the angels and saying:</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> "Thus saith the Lord, Come with me to Paradise and hear the judgement with which I shall judge Adam."</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And when God appeared in paradise, mounted on the chariot of his cherubim with the angels proceeding before him and singing hymns of praises, all the plants of paradise, both of your father's lot and mine, broke out into flowers.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And the throne of God was fixed where the Tree of Life was.</p>


        <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">God Asked Adam, where art thou?</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And God called Adam saying, "Adam, where art thou? Can the house be hidden from the presence of its builder?</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> "Then your father answered; "It is not because we think not to be found by thee, Lord, that we hide, but I was afraid, because I am naked, and I was ashamed before thy might, (my) Master.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> " God saith to him, "Who showed thee that thou art naked, unless thou hast forsaken my commandment, which I delivered thee to keep (it).</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> " Then Adam called to mind the word which I spake to him, (saying) "I will make thee secure before God"; and he turned and said to me: "Why hast thou done this?" And I said, "The serpent deceived me."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">God Announces the Judgement of Adam's Transgression</p>
        
                    <p><sup>1</sup> God saith to Adam: 'Since thou hast disregarded my commandment and hast hearkened to thy wife, cursed is the earth in thy labours.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> Thou shalt work it and it shall not give its strength: thorns and thistles shall spring up for thee, and in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread.
