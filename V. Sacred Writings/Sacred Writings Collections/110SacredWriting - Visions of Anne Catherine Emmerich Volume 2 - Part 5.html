<p class="chapterTitle">From the Nativity of the Virgin Mary to the death of patriarch Saint Joseph</p>

 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">The Arrival in Bethlehem</p>
                               

<p>
<sup>1</sup>The distance from the last public house to Bethlehem may have been three hours. <br>
<sup>2</sup>Mary and Joseph went around by the north and approached the city on the west. <br>
<sup>3</sup>A short distance outside the city, about a quarter of an hour’s walk brought them to a large building surrounded by courtyards and smaller houses. <br>
<sup>4</sup>There were trees in front of it, and all sorts of people encamped in tents around it. <br>
<sup>5</sup>This house was once the paternal home of Joseph, and ages before it had been the family mansion of David. <br>
<sup>6</sup>It was at this period used as the custom house of the Roman taxes.<br>
<sup>7</sup>Joseph still had in the city a brother, who was an innkeeper. <br>
<sup>8</sup>He was not his own brother, but a stepbrother. <br>
<sup>9</sup>Joseph did not go near him. <br>
<sup>10</sup>Joseph had had five brothers, three own-brothers and two stepbrothers. <br>
<sup>11</sup>Joseph was five and forty years old. <br>
<sup>12</sup>He was thirty years and, I think, three months older than Mary. <br>
<sup>13</sup>He was thin, had a fair complexion, prominent cheekbones tinged with red, a high, open forehead, and a brownish beard.<br>
<sup>14</sup> The little she-ass was not with them here. <br>
<sup>15</sup>She had run away around the south side of the city, where it was somewhat level, a kind of valley.<br>
<sup>16</sup>Joseph went straight into the custom house, for all newcomers had to present themselves there and obtain a ticket for entrance at the city gate. <br>
<sup>17</sup>The city had properly no gate, but the entrance lay between two ruined walls that looked like the remains of a gate. <br>
<sup>18</sup>Although Joseph was somewhat late in presenting himself for assessment, he was well received.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Mary remained in a small house in the courtyard among the women, who were very attentive to her, and offered her something to eat. <br>
<sup>20</sup>These women cooked for the soldiers. <br>
<sup>21</sup>The latter were Romans, as I could tell by the straps hanging around their hips. <br>
<sup>22</sup>The weather was lovely, not at all cold, the sun lighting up the mountain between Jerusalem and Bethania. <br>
<sup>23</sup>One can see it very well from here. <br>
<sup>24</sup>Joseph went up to a large room in an upper story, where he was interrogated, who he was, etc., and his questioners examined long rolls of writing, numbers of which were hanging on the walls. <br>
<sup>25</sup>They unrolled them and read to him his ancestry, also that of Mary. <br>
<sup>26</sup>Joseph knew not before that through Joachim, Mary had descended in a straight line from David. <br>
<sup>27</sup>The official asked him, “Where is thy wife?”
<sup>28</sup>For seven years the inhabitants of this part of the country were not regularly assessed, owing to various political troubles. <br>
<sup>29</sup>I saw the numbers V and II, and that certainly makes seven. <br>
<sup>30</sup>The tax collecting had already been going on for many months, but two payments were still to be made. <br>
<sup>31</sup>The people had to remain almost three months. <br>
<sup>32</sup>They had indeed paid something here and there during those seven years, but there had been no regular collection of taxes. <br>
<sup>33</sup>Joseph did not pay anything on that first day, but his circumstances were inquired into. <br>
<sup>34</sup>He told the official that he possessed no real estate, that he lived by his trade and the assistance of his wife’s parents. <br>
<sup>35</sup>Mary also was summoned to appear before the clerk, but not upstairs. <br>
<sup>36</sup>She was interrogated in a passage on the first floor, and nothing was read to her.<br>
<sup>37</sup>There were numbers of clerks and functionaries in the house, scattered throughout the different rooms, and a great many Romans and soldiers were to be met in the upper stories. <br>
<sup>38</sup>There were also Pharisees and Sadducees, priests and elders, and all sorts of clerks and officials of both Jewish and Roman extraction. <br>
<sup>39</sup>There was no such payment of taxes going on in Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>40</sup>But in many other places, in Magdalum on the Sea of Galilee, for instance, taxes were being received. <br>
<sup>41</sup>The Galileans had to pay there, and the people from Sidon, too, partly on account of their commercial intercourse, I think. <br>
<sup>42</sup>Only those that had no establishments, that possessed no estates, had to report at their birthplace.<br>
<sup>43</sup> The receipts for the next three months were to be divided into three parts. <br>
<sup>44</sup>The Emperor Augustus, Herod, and another king who dwelt in the neighborhood of Egypt, had a share in them. <br>
<sup>45</sup>The king near Egypt, having gained some advantage in war, had a claim upon a certain district far up the country; consequently, they had to give him something. <br>
<sup>46</sup>The second payment had some reference to the building of the Temple; it was something like a payment on money advanced. <br>
<sup>47</sup>The third was for the poor and for widows, who had received nothing for a long time. <br>
<sup>48</sup>But it all went as such things do in our own day—little to the right man. <br>
<sup>49</sup>Good reasons were easily found for its remaining in the hands of the great. <br>
<sup>50</sup>Incessant writing and moving to and fro were kept up.<br>
<sup>51</sup> Joseph then went with Mary straight to Bethlehem on whose outskirts the houses stood scattered, and into the heart of the city. <br>
<sup>52</sup>At the different streets they met, he left Mary and the ass standing while he went up and down in search of an inn. <br>
<sup>53</sup>Mary often had to wait long before Joseph, anxious and troubled, returned. <br>
<sup>54</sup>Nowhere did he find room; everywhere was he sent away. <br>
<sup>55</sup>And now it began to grow dark. <br>
<sup>56</sup>Joseph at last proposed going to the other side of the city, where they would surely find lodgings. <br>
<sup>57</sup>They proceeded down a street, which was more of a country road than a regular street, for the houses stood scattered along the hills, and at the end of it reached a low, level space, or field. <br>
<sup>58</sup>Here stood a very beautiful tree with a smooth trunk, its branches spreading out like a roof. <br>
<sup>59</sup>Joseph led Mary and the beast under it, and there left them to go again in quest of an inn. <br>
<sup>60</sup>He went from house to house, his friends, of whom he had spoken to Mary, unwilling to recognize him. <br>
<sup>61</sup>Once during his quest, he returned to Mary, who was waiting under the tree. <br>
<sup>62</sup>He wept, and she consoled him. <br>
<sup>63</sup>He started afresh on his search. <br>
<sup>64</sup>But whenever he brought forward the approaching delivery of his wife as a pressing reason for receiving hospitality, he was dismissed still more quickly.<br>
<sup>65</sup>Meantime it had grown dark. <br>
<sup>66</sup>Mary was standing under the tree, her ungirdled robe falling around her in full folds, her head covered with a white veil. <br>
<sup>67</sup>The ass was nearby, its head turned toward the tree, at the foot of which Joseph had made a seat for Mary with the baggage. <br>
<sup>68</sup>Crowds were hurrying to and fro in Bethlehem, and many of the passersby gazed curiously at Mary, as one naturally does on seeing a person standing a long time in the dark. <br>
<sup>69</sup>I think also that some of them addressed her, and asked her who she was. <br>
<sup>70</sup>Ah, they little dreamed that the Saviour was so near! Mary was so patient, so tranquil, so full of hope. <br>
<sup>71</sup>Ah, she had indeed long to wait! At last she sat down, her hands crossed on her breast, her head lowered. <br>
<sup>72</sup>After a long time, Joseph returned in great dejection. <br>
<sup>73</sup>I saw that he was shedding tears and, because he had failed again to find an inn, he hesitated to approach. <br>
<sup>74</sup>But suddenly he bethought him of a cave outside Bethlehem used as a storing place by the shepherds when they brought their cattle to the city. <br>
<sup>75</sup>Joseph had often withdrawn thither to conceal himself from his brothers and to pray. <br>
<sup>76</sup>It was very likely to be deserted at that season or, if any shepherds did come, it would be easy to make friends with them. <br>
<sup>77</sup>He and Mary might there find shelter for awhile, and after a little rest he would go out again on his search.<br>
<sup>78</sup> And now they went around to the left, as if through the ruined walls, tombs, and ramparts of a country town. <br>
<sup>79</sup>They mounted a rampart or hill, and then the road began again to descend. <br>
<sup>80</sup>At last, they reached a hill before which stood trees, firs, pines, or cedars, and trees with small leaves like the box tree. <br>
<sup>81</sup>In this hill was the cave or vault spoken of by Joseph. <br>
<sup>82</sup>There were no houses around. <br>
<sup>83</sup>One side of the cave was built up with rough masonry through which the open entrance of the shepherds led down into the valley. <br>
<sup>84</sup>Joseph opened the light wicker door and, as they entered, the she-ass ran to meet them. <br>
<sup>85</sup>She had left them near Joseph’s paternal house, and had run around the city to this cave. <br>
<sup>86</sup>She frolicked around and leaped gaily about them, so that Mary said: “Behold! It is surely God’s will that we should be here.”<br>
<sup>87</sup>But Joseph was worried and, in secret, a little ashamed, because he had so often alluded to the good reception they would meet in Bethlehem. <br>
<sup>88</sup>There was a projection above the door under which he stood the ass and then proceeded to arrange a seat for Mary. <br>
<sup>89</sup>It was quite dark, about eight o’clock when they reached this place. <br>
<sup>90</sup>Joseph struck a light and went into the cave. <br>
<sup>91</sup>The entrance was very narrow. <br>
<sup>92</sup>The walls were stuffed with all kinds of coarse straw, like rushes, over which hung brown mats. <br>
<sup>93</sup>Back in the vaulted part were some air holes in the roof, but here also everything was in disorder. <br>
<sup>94</sup>Joseph cleared it out and prepared as much space in the back part as would afford room for a couch and seat for Mary, who had seated herself on a rug with her bundle for a support. <br>
<sup>95</sup>The ass was then brought in, and Joseph fastened a lamp on the wall. <br>
<sup>96</sup>While Mary was eating, he went out to the field in the direction of the Milk Cave, and laid a leathern bottle in the rivulet that it might fill. <br>
<sup>97</sup>He went also to the city where he procured some little dishes, a bundle of other things, and I think, some fruit. <br>
<sup>98</sup>It was, indeed, the Sabbath but, on account of the numerous strangers in the city and their need of various necessaries, provisions and utensils were exposed for sale on tables placed at the street corners. <br>
<sup>99</sup>The price was paid down on the spot. <br>
<sup>100</sup>I think servants or pagan slaves guarded the tables, but I cannot remember for certain.<br>
<sup>101</sup>When Joseph returned, he brought with him a small bundle of slender sticks beautifully bound up with reeds, and a box with a handle in which were glowing coals. <br>
<sup>102</sup>These he poured out at the entrance of the cave to make a fire. <br>
<sup>103</sup>He next brought the water bottle, which he had filled at the rivulet, and prepared some food. <br>
<sup>104</sup>It consisted of a stew, made of yellow corn, some kind of large plant that contained a great many seeds, and a little bread. <br>
<sup>105</sup>After they had eaten and Mary had lain down to rest upon her rush couch over which was spread a cover, Joseph began to prepare his own resting place at the entrance of the cave. <br>
<sup>106</sup>When this was done, he went again into the city. <br>
<sup>107</sup>Previously to setting out, he had stopped up all the openings of the cave, in order to keep out the air. <br>
<sup>108</sup>Then for the first time, I saw the Blessed Virgin on her knees in prayer, after which she lay down upon the carpet on her side, her head resting on her arm, her bundle serving for a pillow.<br>
<sup>109</sup>This cave lay at the extremity of the mountain ridge of Bethlehem. <br>
<sup>110</sup>A clump of beautiful trees stood in front of the entrance, and thence could be descried some of the towers and roofs of the city. <br>
<sup>111</sup>Over the entrance, which was closed by a door made of wickerwork, was a shed. <br>
<sup>112</sup>From the door, a moderately wide passage led into the cave, an irregularly formed vault, half-round, half-triangular. <br>
<sup>113</sup>On one side of the passage was a recess rather lower than the general surface, and this Joseph had enclosed by curtains for his own sleeping place. <br>
<sup>114</sup>The rest of the passage, from the recess to the entrance, he cut off by hangings, and there had a kind of storeroom.<br>
<sup>115</sup> The passage was not so lofty as the cave itself, which was vaulted by nature. <br>
<sup>116</sup>The inner walls of the cave, where they were formed entirely by nature, though not perfectly even, yet were pleasing and clean; indeed to my eye, there was something about them quite charming. <br>
<sup>117</sup>They pleased me more than did those parts upon which some attempts had been made at masonry, for these latter were coarse and rough. <br>
<sup>118</sup>The foundation of the right side of the entrance appeared for some distance to have been hewn out of the rock; only the upper part seemed to have been made by the hand of man. <br>
<sup>119</sup>There were also some holes in this passage. <br>
<sup>120</sup>In the middle of the vaulted roof was an opening and, I think, three others cut obliquely halfway up the same. <br>
<sup>121</sup>These oblique openings presented a smoother appearance than the topmost one; they looked like the handiwork of man. <br>
<sup>122</sup>The floor of the cave was deeper than that of the entrance, and was on three sides surrounded by a stone seat somewhat raised, broad in some places, in others narrow. <br>
<sup>123</sup>At one of the broad parts, the ass took its stand. <br>
<sup>124</sup>It had no trough, but a large leathern bag was placed before it or hung in the corner. <br>
<sup>125</sup>Behind was a small side cave just large enough to allow the animal to stand upright. <br>
<sup>126</sup>There the fodder was stored. <br>
<sup>127</sup>A gutter ran along by this corner, and I saw Joseph cleaning the cave out every day.<br>
<sup>128</sup>Where Mary reposed before the birth of the Child and where I beheld her elevated above the ground at the moment of her delivery, there was a similar seat of stone. <br>
<sup>129</sup>The spot in which the Crib stood was a deep recess, or side vault. <br>
<sup>130</sup>Near it was a second entrance into the cave, which was in the ridge of a hill that ran toward the city. <br>
<sup>131</sup>In the rear, the hill sank into a very charming valley planted with rows of trees. <br>
<sup>132</sup>This valley led to the Suckling Cave of Abraham, situated in a projection of the opposite hill. <br>
<sup>133</sup>The valley may have been one-eighth of an hour in width, and through it flowed that little rivulet from which Joseph had procured the water.<br>
<sup>134</sup>Besides the real Crib Cave, there were in the same hill, but lying somewhat deeper, two other caves, in one of which the Blessed Virgin often remained hidden.<br>
<sup>135</sup>When in after years St. <br>
<sup>136</sup>Paula laid the first foundation of her convent at Bethlehem, I saw a small, lightly-built chapel erected in the valley and on the east side of the cave. <br>
<sup>137</sup>It was so constructed as to be contiguous to the rear of the Crib Cave and directly back of the spot upon which Jesus was born. <br>
<sup>138</sup>This little chapel of wood and wicker walls was hung inside with tapestry. <br>
<sup>139</sup>Four rows of cells opened into it, which were built as lightly as the shepherd’s cots generally are in Palestine. <br>
<sup>140</sup>In every row were separate cells, each surrounded by its own little garden, and all connected by covered passages leading to the chapel. <br>
<sup>141</sup>Here Paula and her daughter gathered around them their first companions. <br>
<sup>142</sup>In the chapel and free from the wall, stood an altar with its little tabernacle. <br>
<sup>143</sup>Behind it hung a red and white silk curtain, which concealed the facsimile of the Crib Cave that St. <br>
<sup>144</sup>Paula had caused to be made. <br>
<sup>145</sup>It was separated from the real cave, from the exact spot upon which Jesus was born, only by the rocky wall. <br>
<sup>146</sup>This crib was made of white stone, and was a faithful imitation of that of Jesus. <br>
<sup>147</sup>The manger also was represented, and even the hay hanging through its sides. <br>
<sup>148</sup>The infant in it was likewise of white stone, and closely swathed in a blue veil. <br>
<sup>149</sup>The figure was hollow and not very heavy. <br>
<sup>150</sup>I saw St. <br>
<sup>151</sup>Paula often taking it up into her arms while she prayed. <br>
<sup>152</sup>Upon the wall over this crib, hung a banner upon which was represented the ass with its head turned toward the crib. <br>
<sup>153</sup>It was embroidered in colors, and the hair made of thread, so natural that it looked like real hair. <br>
<sup>154</sup>Above the crib was a hole in which a star was fastened. <br>
<sup>155</sup>I saw that the Child Jesus often appeared here to St. <br>
<sup>156</sup>Paula and her daughter. <br>
<sup>157</sup>In front of the curtain and right and left of the altar were hanging lamps.</p><br>

 


<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Birth of the Child Jesus</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>I saw Joseph on the following day arranging a seat and couch for Mary in the so-called Suckling Cave of Abraham, which was also the sepulcher of Mar aha, his nurse. <br>
<sup>2</sup>It was more spacious than the cave of the Crib. <br>
<sup>3</sup>Mary remained there some hours, while Joseph was making the latter more habitable. <br>
<sup>4</sup>He brought also from the city many different little vessels and some dried fruits. <br>
<sup>5</sup>Mary told him that the birth hour of the Child would arrive on the coming night. <br>
<sup>6</sup>It was then nine months since her conception by the Holy Ghost. <br>
<sup>7</sup>She begged him to do all in his power that they might receive as honorably as possible this Child promised by God, this Child supernaturally conceived; and she invited him to unite with her in prayer for those hard-hearted people who would afford Him no place of shelter. <br>
<sup>8</sup>Joseph proposed to bring some pious women whom he knew in Bethlehem to her assistance; but Mary would not allow it, she declared that she had no need of anyone. <br>
<sup>9</sup>It was five o’clock in the evening when Joseph brought Mary back again to the Crib Cave. <br>
<sup>10</sup>He hung up several more lamps, and made a place under the shed before the door for the little she-ass, which came joyfully hurrying from the fields to meet them.<br>
<sup>11</sup>When Mary told Joseph that her time was drawing near and that he should now betake himself to prayer, he left her and turned toward his sleeping place to do her bidding. <br>
<sup>12</sup>Before entering his little recess, he looked back once toward that part of the cave where Mary knelt upon her couch in prayer, her back to him, her face toward the east. <br>
<sup>13</sup>He saw the cave filled with the light that streamed from Mary, for she was entirely enveloped as if by flames. <br>
<sup>14</sup>It was as if he were, like Moses, looking into the burning bush. <br>
<sup>15</sup>He sank prostrate to the ground in prayer, and looked not back again. <br>
<sup>16</sup>The glory around Mary became brighter and brighter, the lamps that Joseph had lit were no longer to be seen. <br>
<sup>17</sup>Mary knelt, her flowing white robe spread out before her. <br>
<sup>18</sup>At the twelfth hour, her prayer became ecstatic, and I saw her raised so far above the ground that one could see it beneath her. <br>
<sup>19</sup>Her hands were crossed upon her breast, and the light around her grew even more resplendent. <br>
<sup>20</sup>I no longer saw the roof of the cave. <br>
<sup>21</sup>Above Mary stretched a pathway of light up to Heaven, in which pathway it seemed as if one light came forth from another, as if one figure dissolved into another, and from these different spheres of light other heavenly figures issued. <br>
<sup>22</sup>Mary continued in prayer, her eyes bent low upon the ground. <br>
<sup>23</sup>At that moment she gave birth to the Infant Jesus. <br>
<sup>24</sup>I saw Him like a tiny, shining Child, lying on the rug at her knees, and brighter far than all the other brilliancy. <br>
<sup>25</sup>He seemed to grow before my eyes. <br>
<sup>26</sup>But dazzled by the glittering and flashing of light, I know not whether I really saw that, or how I saw it. <br>
<sup>27</sup>Even inanimate nature seemed stirred. <br>
<sup>28</sup>The stones of the rocky floor and the walls of the cave were glimmering and sparkling, as if instinct with life.<br>
<sup>29</sup>Mary’s ecstasy lasted some moments longer. <br>
<sup>30</sup>Then I saw her spread a cover over the Child, but she did not yet take It up, nor even touch It. <br>
<sup>31</sup>After a long time, I saw the Child stirring and heard It crying, and then only did Mary seem to recover full consciousness. <br>
<sup>32</sup>She lifted the Child, along with the cover that she had thrown over It, to her breast and sat veiled, herself and Child quite enveloped. <br>
<sup>33</sup>I think she was suckling It. <br>
<sup>34</sup>I saw angels around her in human form prostrate on their faces. <br>
<sup>35</sup>It may, perhaps, have been an hour after the birth when Mary called St. <br>
<sup>36</sup>Joseph, who still lay prostrate in prayer. <br>
<sup>37</sup>When he approached, he fell on his knees, his face to the ground, in a transport of joy, devotion, and humility. <br>
<sup>38</sup>Mary again urged him to look upon the Sacred Gift from Heaven, and then did Joseph take the Child into his arms. <br>
<sup>39</sup>And now the Blessed Virgin swathed the Child in red and over that in a white veil up as far as under the little arms, and the upper part of the body from the armpits to the head, she wrapped up in another piece of linen. <br>
<sup>40</sup>She had only four swaddling cloths with her. <br>
<sup>41</sup>She laid the Child in the Crib, which had been filled with rushes and fine moss over which was spread a cover that hung down at the sides. <br>
<sup>42</sup>The Crib stood over the stone trough, and at this spot the ground stretched straight and level as far as the passage, where it made a broader flexure toward the south. <br>
<sup>43</sup>The floor of this part of the cave lay somewhat deeper than where the Child was born, and down to it steps had been formed in the earth. <br>
<sup>44</sup>When Mary laid the Child in the Crib, both she and Joseph stood by It in tears, singing the praises of God.<br>
<sup>45</sup>The seat and the couch of the Blessed Virgin were near the Crib. <br>
<sup>46</sup>I saw her on the first day sitting upright and also resting on her side, though I noticed in her no special signs of weakness or sickness. <br>
<sup>47</sup>Both before and after the birth, she was robed in white. <br>
<sup>48</sup>When visitors came, she generally sat near the Crib more closely veiled.<br>
<sup>49</sup>On the night of the Birth there gushed forth a beautiful spring in the other cave that lay to the right. <br>
<sup>50</sup>The water ran out, and the next day Joseph dug a course for it and formed a spring.<br>
<sup>51</sup>In those visions to which the event itself, and not the feast of the Church, gave rise, I saw, indeed, no such sparkling joy in nature as I sometimes see at holy Christmastide. <br>
<sup>52</sup>Then the joy has an interior signification. <br>
<sup>53</sup>But yet, I saw extraordinary gladness, and in many places, even in the most distant regions of the world, something marvelous on that midnight. <br>
<sup>54</sup>By it the good were filled with joyful longings, and the bad with dread. <br>
<sup>55</sup>I saw also many of the lower animals joyfully agitated. <br>
<sup>56</sup>I saw fountains gushing forth and swelling, flowers springing up in many places, trees and plants budding with new life, and all sending forth their fragrance. <br>
<sup>57</sup>In Bethlehem it was misty, and the sky above shone with a murky, reddish glare. <br>
<sup>58</sup>But over the valley of the shepherds, around the Crib, and in the vale of the Suckling Cave floated bright clouds of refreshing dew.<br>
<sup>59</sup>I saw the herds of the three oldest shepherds near the hill under sheds; but those further on near the shepherds’ tower, were partly in the open air. <br>
<sup>60</sup>The three eldest shepherds, roused by the wonders of the night, I saw standing together before their huts, gazing around and pointing out the magnificent light that shone over the Crib. <br>
<sup>61</sup>The shepherds at the distant tower were also in full movement. <br>
<sup>62</sup>They had climbed up the tower and were looking toward the Crib over which they, too, saw the light. <br>
<sup>63</sup>I saw something like a cloud of glory descend upon the three shepherds. <br>
<sup>64</sup>I saw in it figures moving to and fro, and heard the approach of sweet, clear voices singing softly. <br>
<sup>65</sup>At first, the shepherds were frightened. <br>
<sup>66</sup>Soon there stood before them five or seven lovely, radiant figures holding in their hands a long strip like a scroll upon which were written words in letters a hand in length. <br>
<sup>67</sup>The angels were singing, the angels appeared also to the shepherds on the tower and where else, I do not now recall. <br>
<sup>68</sup>I did not see them hurrying off at once to the cave. <br>
<sup>69</sup>The first three were indeed an hour and a half distant from it, and those on the tower as far again. <br>
<sup>70</sup>But I saw that they began at once to reflect upon what gifts they should take to the newborn Saviour, and to get them together as quickly as possible. <br>
<sup>71</sup>The three shepherds went to the Crib early next morning.<br>
<sup>72</sup>I saw that Anne at Nazareth, Elizabeth in Juttah, Noemi, Anna, and Simeon in the Temple—all had on this night visions from which they learned the birth of the Saviour. <br>
<sup>73</sup>The child John was unspeakably joyous. <br>
<sup>74</sup>But only Anne knew where the newborn Child was; the others, and even Elizabeth, knew indeed of Mary and saw her in vision, but they knew nothing of Bethlehem.<br>
<sup>75</sup>I saw something very wonderful taking place in the Temple. <br>
<sup>76</sup>The writings of the Sadducees were more than once hurled by an invisible force from the places in which they were kept, which circumstance gave rise to unaccountable dread. <br>
<sup>77</sup>The fact was ascribed to sorcery, and large sums of money were paid to hush the matter up.<br>
<sup>78</sup>I saw that in Rome, across the river where numbers of Jews dwelt, a well of oil gushed forth spon-taneously, to the wonder of all the witnesses. <br>
<sup>79</sup>And when Jesus was born, a magnificent statue of the god Jupiter fell with violence from its place. <br>
<sup>80</sup>All were struck with fear. <br>
<sup>81</sup>Sacrifices were offered and another idol, I think Venus, was interrogated as to the cause. <br>
<sup>82</sup>The devil was forced to speak by its mouth, and he proclaimed that it had happened because a virgin unmarried had conceived and brought forth a son. <br>
<sup>83</sup>He told them also of the miracle of the oil well. <br>
<sup>84</sup>Where this took place now stands a church in honor of the Mother of God. <br>
<sup>85</sup>I saw that the pagan priests were deeply perplexed at the whole affair. <br>
<sup>86</sup>They searched their writings, and discovered the following history. <br>
<sup>87</sup>About seventy years previously, this idol (Jupiter) had been greatly venerated. <br>
<sup>88</sup>It was magnificently ornamented with gold and precious stones, grand ceremonies were held in its honor, and numer-ous sacrifices offered to it. <br>
<sup>89</sup>But there was in Rome at that time an extraordinarily pious woman who lived on her own means. <br>
<sup>90</sup>I know not for certain whether she was a Jewess or not; but she had visions, uttered prophecies, and informed many persons as to the cause of their sterility. <br>
<sup>91</sup>This woman had thrown out words to this effect that they should not honor the idol at so great a cost, for that they would one day behold it burst asunder in their midst. <br>
<sup>92</sup>This speech proved so offensive that she was imprisoned and tormented until by her prayers she obtained from God the information as to when that misfortune would happen. <br>
<sup>93</sup>The pagan priests demanded what had been revealed to her, and when at last she replied: “The idol will be shattered when an Immaculate Virgin shall bring forth a son,” they hooted at her, and released her as a fool. <br>
<sup>94</sup>And now the people recalled the fact and declared that the woman had spoken truly. <br>
<sup>95</sup>I saw also that the Roman consuls, of whom one was named Lentulus and who was a friend of St. <br>
<sup>96</sup>Peter and an ancestor of the martyr-priest Moses, made notes of this occurrence, as well as that of the bursting forth of the oil well.<br>
<sup>97</sup>On this night, I saw the Emperor Augustus at the Capitol where he had an apparition of a rainbow upon which sat the Virgin and Child. <br>
<sup>98</sup>From the oracle that he caused to be interrogated upon what he had seen, he received the answer: “A Child is born, and before Him we must all flee!” The emperor at once erected an altar and offered sacrifice to the Son of the Virgin, as to the “Firstborn of God.”<br>
<sup>99</sup>I had also a vision of Egypt far beyond Matarea, Heliopolis, and Memphis. <br>
<sup>100</sup>There was in that region a large idol that used to give answers to all kinds of questions. <br>
<sup>101</sup>Suddenly it became mute. <br>
<sup>102</sup>The king ordered immense sacrifices to be offered throughout his whole dominions. <br>
<sup>103</sup>Then was the devil, upon the command of God, forced to say: “I have become silent, I must give place to another. <br>
<sup>104</sup>The Son of the Virgin is born, and a temple will be here erected to His honor.”<br>
<sup>105</sup> Upon hearing this, the king wanted to raise a temple to the newborn Child next to that of the god, but I do not clearly recall the story. <br>
<sup>106</sup>I know, however, that the idol was put aside and that a temple was erected to the Virgin and Child whom it had proclaimed, and who were afterward honored with pagan rites.<br>
<sup>107</sup>I beheld a great wonder in the country of the Three Kings. <br>
<sup>108</sup>There was a tower on a mountain to which the Kings retired in turn with a retinue of priests, in order to observe the stars. <br>
<sup>109</sup>What they saw they committed to writing and communicated to one another. <br>
<sup>110</sup>On this night there were two of them there, Mensor and Seir. <br>
<sup>111</sup>The third, who dwelt toward the east side of the Caspian Sea, was called Theokeno. <br>
<sup>112</sup>He was not present. <br>
<sup>113</sup>There was a certain constellation at which they always gazed, and whose variations they noted. <br>
<sup>114</sup>In it they saw visions and pictures. <br>
<sup>115</sup>Upon this night also, they had several visions of various kinds. <br>
<sup>116</sup>It was not in one star alone that they saw those visions, but in several that formed a figure, and there seemed to be a movement in them. <br>
<sup>117</sup>They saw the vision of the moon over which arose a beautiful rainbow-colored arch on which was seated a Vir-gin. <br>
<sup>118</sup>The left limb was drawn up in a sitting posture, the right hung a little lower and rested on the moon. <br>
<sup>119</sup>To the left of the Virgin and rising above the arch, was a grapevine, and on her right a sheaf of wheat. <br>
<sup>120</sup>In front of the Virgin was a chalice like that used at the Last Supper. <br>
<sup>121</sup>It appeared to issue, but with greater clearness and brightness, from the brilliancy that emanated from her. <br>
<sup>122</sup>Out of the chalice arose a Child, and over the Child shone a bright disk like an empty ostensorium. <br>
<sup>123</sup>It was surrounded by radiating beams. <br>
<sup>124</sup>It reminded me of the Blessed Sacrament. <br>
<sup>125</sup>On the Virgin’s right was an octangular church with a golden door and two small side-doors. <br>
<sup>126</sup>With the right hand, the Virgin put the Child and the host into the church which, meanwhile, grew larger and larger, and in which I saw the Most Holy Trinity. <br>
<sup>127</sup>Above the church arose a tower. <br>
<sup>128</sup>Theokeno, the third king, had similar visions in his own home.<br>
<sup>129</sup>Over the head of the Virgin sitting on the arch shone a star, which suddenly shot from its place and skimmed along the heavens before the Kings. <br>
<sup>130</sup>It was for them a voice announcing as never before that the Child, so long awaited by them and by their ancestors, was at last born in Judea, and that they were to follow that star. <br>
<sup>131</sup>For some nights immediately preceding that blessed one, they had from their tower seen all kinds of visions in the heavens, kings journeying to the Child and offering their homage to It. <br>
<sup>132</sup>So now they hurriedly gathered together their treasures and with gifts and presents began the journey, for they did not want to be the last. <br>
<sup>133</sup>I saw all three after a few days meeting on the way.</p><br>




<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Adoration of the Shepherds. Devout Visits to the Crib</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>In the early dawn after the birth of Jesus, the three oldest of the shepherds came to the Crib Cave with the gifts they had gathered together. <br>
<sup>2</sup>These consisted of little animals bearing some resemblance to deer. <br>
<sup>3</sup>They were very lightly built and nimble, had long necks and clear, beautiful eyes. <br>
<sup>4</sup>They followed or ran along beside the shepherds who led them with fine, guiding cords. <br>
<sup>5</sup>The shepherds carried also large, live birds under their arms, and dead ones slung over their shoulders.<br>
<sup>6</sup>They told Joseph at the entrance of the cave what the angel had announced to them, and that they had come to do homage to the Child of Promise and to offer Him gifts. <br>
<sup>7</sup>Joseph accepted their presents and allowed them to lead the animals into the space that formed a kind of cellar near the side entrance of the cave. <br>
<sup>8</sup>Then he conducted them to the Blessed Virgin, who was sitting on the ground near the Crib, a rug under her, the Infant Jesus on her lap. <br>
<sup>9</sup>The shepherds, their staves resting on their arms, fell on their knees and wept with joy. <br>
<sup>10</sup>They knelt long, tasting great interior sweetness, and then intoned the angelic canticle of praise, and a Psalm that I have forgotten. <br>
<sup>11</sup>When they were about to take leave, Mary placed the Child in their arms.<br>
<sup>12</sup>Some of the other shepherds came in the evening, accompanied by women and children, and bringing gifts. <br>
<sup>13</sup>They sang most sweetly before the Crib the some Psalms, and short refrains of which I remember the words: “O Child, blooming as a rose art Thou! As a herald Thou comest forth!” <br>
<sup>14</sup>They brought gifts of birds, eggs, honey, woven stuffs of various colors, bundles of raw silk, and ears of corn, also several bundles of a corn with heavy grains growing on a stalk with large leaves like those of rushes.</p><br>




<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Cave of the Nativity, Bethlehem</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>(The site of the Nativity is attested to by an unbroken tradition dating back to the 2nd Century. <br>
<sup>2</sup>This plan is a suggested reconstruction of the original arrangement based on the description in the “ and the present form of the caves (shaded areas). <br>
<sup>3</sup>During the centuries there have been many additions and enlargements. <br>
<sup>4</sup>Sister Emmerich stated that new grottoes were cut in the rock even during the lifetime of Our Lord. <br>
<sup>5</sup>The basilica, erected by Constantine over the cave in the 4th Century, and still in use, is one of the oldest Christian churches in the world).<br>
<sup>6</sup>The three oldest shepherds came back in turn and helped Joseph to make the Crib Cave and its surroundings more comfortable. <br>
<sup>7</sup>I saw also several pious women with the Blessed Virgin, performing some services for her. <br>
<sup>8</sup>They were Essenians, and lived in the valley, not far from the Crib Cave, in little rocky cells adjoining one another. <br>
<sup>9</sup>They owned little gardens near their cells, and they taught the children of their community. <br>
<sup>10</sup>St. Joseph had invited them to come, for he was acquainted with them even in early youth. <br>
<sup>11</sup>When he was hiding in the Crib Cave, from his brethren, he visited these pious women who dwelt in the side of the rock. <br>
<sup>12</sup>They now came in turn to the Blessed Virgin, bringing little necessaries and bundles of wood. <br>
<sup>13</sup>They cooked and washed for the Holy Family.<br>
<sup>14</sup>Some days after the birth of Jesus, I saw a touching scene in the Crib Cave. <br>
<sup>15</sup>Joseph and Mary were standing by the Crib and gazing with emotion upon the Infant Jesus, when suddenly the ass fell upon its knees and lowered its head to the ground. <br>
<sup>16</sup>Mary and Joseph shed tears. <br>
<sup>17</sup>I saw Mary at another time standing by the Crib. <br>
<sup>18</sup>As she gazed upon the Child, the deep conviction stole upon her that It had come upon earth to suffer. <br>
<sup>19</sup>That reminded me of a vision I had had at an earlier period in which I had been shown how Jesus, while still in His Mother’s womb and from the moment of His birth, had suffered. <br>
<sup>20</sup>I saw under the heart of Mary a glory and in it a bright shining Child. <br>
<sup>21</sup>As I gazed upon It, it seemed as if Mary were hovering over It and surrounding It. <br>
<sup>22</sup>I beheld the Child growing and all the torments of the Crucifixion inflicted upon It. <br>
<sup>23</sup>It was a sad, a fearful sight! I wept and sobbed aloud. <br>
<sup>24</sup>I saw other forms around It beating and pushing, scourging and crowning It. <br>
<sup>25</sup>Then they laid the Cross upon It, next nailed It to the same, and pierced It in the side. <br>
<sup>26</sup>I saw the whole Passion of Christ in the Child. <br>
<sup>27</sup>It was a frightful sight! As the Child hung on the Cross, It said to me: “All this did I suffer from My conception until My thirty-fourth year, when My Passion was outwardly consummated.”<br>
<sup>28</sup>(The Lord died when He was thirty-three years and three months old.)<br>
<sup>29</sup>“Go and announce it to men!” But how can I announce it to men?<br>
<sup>30</sup>I saw Jesus also as the newborn Child, and I saw how many of the children that went to the Crib ill treated the Infant Jesus. <br>
<sup>31</sup>The Mother of God was not there to protect the Child, and the children went with all kinds of switches and rods, and struck It in the face until the Blood flowed. <br>
<sup>32</sup>The Child meekly extended Its little hands before Its face, in order to ward off the blows. <br>
<sup>33</sup>The smallest children were they that struck the most maliciously. <br>
<sup>34</sup>The parents of some even twisted and wrapped the rods for them. <br>
<sup>35</sup>They brought thorns, nettles, whips, little rods of all kinds, each having its own signification. <br>
<sup>36</sup>One came with a very slender rod, like a reed. <br>
<sup>37</sup>But when it was about to strike the Child, the rod snapped, and fell back upon itself. <br>
<sup>38</sup>I knew several of the children. <br>
<sup>39</sup>Some went about boasting in their fine clothes, but I stripped them, and whipped some of them well.<br>
<sup>40</sup>While Mary was still standing by the Crib in deep meditation, some shepherds drew near with their wives, in all about five persons. <br>
<sup>41</sup>To give them room to approach the Crib, the Blessed Virgin withdrew a little to the spot upon which she had given birth to the Child. <br>
<sup>42</sup>The people did not actually adore, but they gazed down upon the Child deeply moved, and before leaving they bowed low over It as if kissing It.<br>
<sup>43</sup>It was day. <br>
<sup>44</sup>Mary sat in her usual place with the Infant Jesus on her lap. <br>
<sup>45</sup>He was swathed, the hands and face alone free, Mary had something like a piece of linen in her hands with which she was busied. <br>
<sup>46</sup>Joseph was at the fireplace near the entrance of the cave, and appeared to be making a shelf to hold some vessels. <br>
<sup>47</sup>I was standing next the ass. <br>
<sup>48</sup>And now came in three aged female Essenians, who were cordially welcomed, though Mary did not rise. <br>
<sup>49</sup>They brought quite a number of presents: small fruits, birds with red, awl-shaped beaks as large as ducks, which they carried by the wings, oval rolls about an inch in thickness, some linen, and other stuff. <br>
<sup>50</sup>All were received with rare humility and gratitude. <br>
<sup>51</sup>The women were very silent and recollected. <br>
<sup>52</sup>Deeply moved, they gazed down upon the Child, but they did not touch It. <br>
<sup>53</sup>When they withdrew, it was without farewells or ceremony. <br>
<sup>54</sup>Meanwhile, I was taking a good look at the ass. <br>
<sup>55</sup>It had a very broad back, and I thought to myself: “You good beast! You have carried a great burden!”1 and I wanted to feel it, to see if it were real. <br>
<sup>56</sup>I ran my hand over its hair, and it felt as smooth as silk.<br>
<sup>57</sup>Now came two married women with three little girls about eight years old. <br>
<sup>58</sup>They appeared to be strangers and people of distinction, who had come in obedience to a call more miraculous than that received by any previous visitor. <br>
<sup>59</sup>Joseph welcomed them very humbly. <br>
<sup>60</sup>They brought presents less in size than the others, but of greater value: grain in a bowl, small fruits, and a cluster of thick, triangular, gold leaves on which was a stamp like a seal. <br>
<sup>61</sup>I thought: “Strange! That looks like the representation of the eye of God! But no! How can I compare the eye of God with red earth!” Mary arose and placed the Child in the ladies’ arms. <br>
<sup>62</sup>Both held Him a little while, praying silently with uplifted heart, and then kissed Him. <br>
<sup>63</sup>The three little girls were silent and deeply impressed. <br>
<sup>64</sup>Joseph and Mary conversed with their visitors and when they left, Joseph accompanied them part of the way. <br>
<sup>65</sup>Ah! Could we, like these women, behold the beauty, the purity, the innocent wisdom of Mary! She knew all things! But in her humility, she appears unconscious of her gifts. <br>
<sup>66</sup>Like a child, she casts down her eyes; and when she raises them, her glance, like a flash of lightning, like the truth, like a ray of unsullied light, pierces one through and through. <br>
<sup>67</sup>That is because she is perfectly pure, perfectly innocent, full of the Holy Ghost, and without any reflection on self. <br>
<sup>68</sup>No one can resist her glance.<br>
<sup>69</sup>These people appeared to have come at least some miles and that secretly, for they avoided being seen in the city. <br>
<sup>70</sup>Joseph behaved with great humility during such visits, retiring and looking on from some distant corner.<br>
<sup>71</sup>I saw also Anne’s maid and an old man servant coming from Nazareth to the Crib. <br>
<sup>72</sup>The maid was a widow and related to the Holy Family. <br>
<sup>73</sup>She brought all sorts of necessaries from Anne to Mary, with whom she took up her abode. <br>
<sup>74</sup>The old man shed tears of joy, and returned with news to Anne.<br>
<sup>75</sup>The day after, I saw the Blessed Virgin and the Infant Jesus leave the Crib Cave with the maid for some hours. <br>
<sup>76</sup>Stepping from the door of the cave, Mary turned toward the shed on the right, went some steps forward, and concealed herself in that side cave in which, at the birth of Jesus, a spring had welled up. <br>
<sup>77</sup>She remained there four hours, because some men, spies of Herod, had come from Bethlehem, in consequence of the rumor set afloat by the words of the shepherds, that a miracle had there taken place in connection with a child. <br>
<sup>78</sup>These men met St. <br>
<sup>79</sup>Joseph in front of the Crib Cave. <br>
<sup>80</sup>After exchanging a few words with him, they left him with a contemptuous smile at his humility and simplicity.<br>
<sup>81</sup>The Crib Cave was retired, and very pleasantly situated. <br>
<sup>82</sup>No one from Bethlehem went there, only the shepherds whose duties called them thither. <br>
<sup>83</sup>No one in Bethlehem took any interest in what was going on outside for, in consequence of the influx of strangers, the city was all alive, and much buying and selling going on. <br>
<sup>84</sup>Cattle was being bought and slaughtered, for many people paid their taxes in cattle. <br>
<sup>85</sup>There were numbers of pagans in the city in the capacity of servants.<br>
<sup>86</sup>The wonderful apparition of the angels was soon noised among the dwellers of the mountain valleys far and near, and with it the birth of the Child in the cave. <br>
<sup>87</sup>The innkeepers from whom the Holy Family on their journey had received hospitality now came, one after another, to do homage to Him whom unknown they had entertained. <br>
<sup>88</sup>I saw that hospitable keeper of the last inn, first sending presents by a servant, and then coming himself to honor the Child. <br>
<sup>89</sup>I saw also the good wife of that man who had been so cross to Joseph, and other shepherds and good people coming to the Crib. <br>
<sup>90</sup>They were very much affected by what they saw. <br>
<sup>91</sup>All were in holiday attire, and were going up to Bethlehem for the Sabbath. <br>
<sup>92</sup>The good wife might have gone to Jerusalem which was nearer, but she preferred coming here to Bethlehem.<br>
<sup>93</sup>A relative of Joseph, and father of that Jonadab who, at the Crucifixion of Jesus presented a strip of linen to Him, had also come to the Crib Cave on his way to Bethlehem for the Sabbath. <br>
<sup>94</sup>Joseph was very kind to him. <br>
<sup>95</sup>This relative had heard from people of his place of Joseph’s wonderful situation; he came therefore to bring him gifts and to visit the Infant Jesus and Mary. <br>
<sup>96</sup>But Joseph would not accept anything, although he pawned the little she-ass to this relative with the understanding that she might be redeemed for the same amount of money received. <br>
<sup>97</sup>After that, Mary, Joseph, the maid, and two of the shepherds who were standing in front of the entrance, celebrated the Sabbath in the Crib Cave. <br>
<sup>98</sup>A lamp with seven wicks was lighted, and upon a small table covered with white and red, lay the prayer rolls.<br>
<sup>99</sup>The numerous eatables presented by the shepherds were either given to the poor or handed around for the entertainment of others. <br>
<sup>100</sup>The birds were hung on a spit before the fire, turned from time to time, and sprinkled with the flour of a reed-like plant which was very plentiful around the area of Bethlehem and Hebron. <br>
<sup>101</sup>From its grain a shining, white jelly was prepared and cakes baked. <br>
<sup>102</sup>I saw under the fireplace very hot and clean holes in which birds could be roasted.<br>
<sup>103</sup>After the Sabbath, the Essenian women got a meal ready under the arbors which Joseph, with the help of the shepherds, had put up at the entrance of the cave. <br>
<sup>104</sup>Joseph went into the city to engage priests for the circumcision of the Child. <br>
<sup>105</sup>The cave was cleared and put in order. <br>
<sup>106</sup>The partition that Joseph had put up in the passage was removed, and the ground spread with carpets, for in this passage near the Crib Cave, the place for the ceremony was prepared.</p><br>





<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Circumcision</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>Joseph returned from Bethlehem with five priests and a woman whose services were necessary on such occasions. <br>
<sup>2</sup>They brought with them the circumcision stool and an octangular slab with all that was needed for the ceremony. <br>
<sup>3</sup>All this was placed in order in the passage. <br>
<sup>4</sup>The stool was hollow and formed a chest, which could be taken apart, thus affording a kind of low seat with a support on the side. <br>
<sup>5</sup>It was covered with red. <br>
<sup>6</sup>The circumcision stone was, perhaps, over two feet in diameter. <br>
<sup>7</sup>In the center was a metal plate under which, in a hollow of the stone, were all kinds of little boxes containing fluids. <br>
<sup>8</sup>These boxes were in separate compartments, and at one side lay the circumcision knife. <br>
<sup>9</sup>The stone was laid upon the little stool which, covered with a cloth, always stood on the spot upon which Jesus was born, and the circumcision stool was placed next to it. <br>
<sup>10</sup>That evening a repast was spread under the arbor at the entrance to the cave. <br>
<sup>11</sup>A crowd of poor people had followed the priests, as is usual on such occasions, and during the meal they were continually receiving something both from the priests and from Joseph. <br>
<sup>12</sup>The priests went to Mary and the Child, spoke with the mother, and took the Child in their arms. <br>
<sup>13</sup>They also spoke to Joseph about the name the Child was to receive. <br>
<sup>14</sup>They prayed and sang the greater part of the night, and circumcised the Child at daybreak. <br>
<sup>15</sup>Mary was very much troubled, very anxious about It. <br>
<sup>16</sup>After the ceremony, the Infant Jesus was swathed in red and white as far as under the little arms, which also were bound and the head wrapped in a cloth. <br>
<sup>17</sup>The Child was again laid on the octangular stone, and prayers recited over It. <br>
<sup>18</sup>If I remember rightly, the angel had already told Joseph that the Child should be called Jesus, and I have a faint recollection that one of the priests did not at first approve the name, consequently, they still continued in prayer. <br>
<sup>19</sup>Then I saw a radiant angel stand-ing in front of the priest and holding before him a tablet like that above the Cross, upon which was inscribed the name of Jesus. <br>
<sup>20</sup>I saw the priest writing the name upon a scrap of parchment. <br>
<sup>21</sup>I know not whether he or any of the others saw the angel, but deeply moved, he wrote the name under divine inspiration. <br>
<sup>22</sup>After that, Joseph received the Child back and handed It to the Blessed Virgin who, with two other women, was standing back in the Crib Cave. <br>
<sup>23</sup>Mary took the weeping Child into her arms and quieted It. <br>
<sup>24</sup>Some shepherds were standing at the entrance of the cave. <br>
<sup>25</sup>Lamps were burning, and the dawn was breaking. <br>
<sup>26</sup>There was some more praying and singing and, before the priests departed, they took a little breakfast. <br>
<sup>27</sup>I saw that all present at the circumcision were good people. <br>
<sup>28</sup>The priests were enlightened and later attained salvation. <br>
<sup>29</sup>Alms were distributed the whole morning to many poor people who presented themselves. <br>
<sup>30</sup>Afterward followed a crowd of beggars, filthy, black creatures, very repulsive to me. <br>
<sup>31</sup>They carried bundles and, coming up from the valley of the shepherds, passed the Crib as if going to Jerusalem for the celebration of a feast. <br>
<sup>32</sup>They were very boisterous, cursing and scolding horribly, because they did not receive by way of alms, as much as they wanted. <br>
<sup>33</sup>I do not know exactly what was the matter with them. <br>
<sup>34</sup>During the ceremony of circumcision, the ass was tied further back than usual; at other times, it stood in the Crib Cave.<br>
<sup>35</sup>During the day, I saw the nurse again with Mary attending to the Child. <br>
<sup>36</sup>That night, the Child was very restless from pain. <br>
<sup>37</sup>It cried, and Mary and Joseph tried to soothe It by carrying It up and down the cave.<br>
<sup>38</sup>While reflecting upon the mystery of the circumcision, I had a vision. <br>
<sup>39</sup>I saw two angels with little tablets in their hands, standing under a palm tree. <br>
<sup>40</sup>Upon one tablet were pictured various instruments of martyrdom, of which I remember one, a pillar which stood in the middle. <br>
<sup>41</sup>On it was a mortar, which had two rings. <br>
<sup>42</sup>On the other tablet were letters denoting the seasons and years of the Church. <br>
<sup>43</sup>On the palm tree and as if growing out of it, was kneeling a Virgin, her flowing mantle, or veil, for it was fastened over her head, floating around her. <br>
<sup>44</sup>In her hands was a heart upon which I saw a tiny, shining Child. <br>
<sup>45</sup>I saw an apparition of God the Father draw near to the palm tree, break off a heavy branch that formed a cross, and lay it on the Child. <br>
<sup>46</sup>Then I saw the Child raised, as it were, on the cross, and the Virgin reaching the palm branch with the crucified Child on it to God the Father, the heart alone remaining in her hand.<br>
<sup>47</sup>On the evening of the following day, I saw Elizabeth on an ass and accompanied by an old servant, coming from Juta to the cave. <br>
<sup>48</sup>Joseph received her most cordially. <br>
<sup>49</sup>The joy of Mary and Elizabeth was extremely great as they embraced each other. <br>
<sup>50</sup>Elizabeth pressed the Child to her heart. <br>
<sup>51</sup>She slept in Mary’s cave next the place in which Jesus was born. <br>
<sup>52</sup>Before the sacred spot stood a stool upon which they often laid the Child.<br>
<sup>53</sup>Mary told Elizabeth all that had happened to her, and when Elizabeth heard of their difficulty in getting a lodging on their arrival in Bethlehem, she wept heartily. <br>
<sup>54</sup>Mary gave her all the details of the Infant Jesus’ birth. <br>
<sup>55</sup>I remember hearing her say that she had been in ecstasy ten minutes at the time of the Annunciation, that it appeared to her as if her heart had grown double its size and that she was filled with unspeakable happiness. <br>
<sup>56</sup>But at the Child’s birth she had experienced an intense longing. <br>
<sup>57</sup>She felt while kneeling that she was upheld by angels, and as if her heart was broken asunder and one-half taken from her. <br>
<sup>58</sup>She had also been ten minutes in ecstasy at the time of the birth. <br>
<sup>59</sup>She had been conscious of an emptiness within her, a longing after something outside of herself. <br>
<sup>60</sup>Suddenly a light shone before her, and the figure of the Child seemed to grow before her eyes. <br>
<sup>61</sup>Then she saw It moving and heard It crying and, coming to herself, she raised It from the rug to her breast, for at first seeing It environed with glory, she had hesitated to take It up.<br>
<sup>62</sup>Elizabeth said: “Thou hast not given birth in the same way as other mothers. <br>
<sup>63</sup>The birth of John was sweet also, but it was not like that of thy Child.”<br>
<sup>64</sup>Once I saw Elizabeth with Mary and the Child concealing themselves toward evening in the side cave. <br>
<sup>65</sup>They remained there the whole night, for visitors from Bethlehem were approaching by whom they did not want to be seen.<br>
<sup>66</sup>The Jewish women do not leave their children long without other nourishment than the breast; and so the Infant Jesus was fed in those first days on pap made of the sweet, light, nutritious pith of a certain rush-like plant.<br>
<sup>67</sup>As in the Temple at Jerusalem, the holy Feast of the Machabees began at this time, it was also celebrated by Joseph in the Crib Cave. <br>
<sup>68</sup>He fastened three lamps with seven little lights on the walls of the cave and, during a whole week, lighted them morning and evening. <br>
<sup>69</sup>Once I saw in the cave one of the priests who had been present at the Child’s circumcision. <br>
<sup>70</sup>He had a roll of writings from which he prayed with St. <br>
<sup>71</sup>Joseph. <br>
<sup>72</sup>It seemed to me that he wanted to find out whether Joseph kept that feast or not. <br>
<sup>73</sup>I think, too, that he announced to him another, for a fast-day was near at hand. <br>
<sup>74</sup>I saw the preparations for it in Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>75</sup>Food was prepared the day before the feast, the fire was covered, servile work was put aside, the doors and windows were hung with tapestry.<br>
<sup>76</sup>Anne often sent servants with gifts of provisions and utensils, all of which Mary soon distributed to the poor. <br>
<sup>77</sup>Once Anne sent a beautiful little basket of fruit with large, newly-blown roses stuck in among it. <br>
<sup>78</sup>The pink roses were paler than ours, almost flesh colored, and there were some yellow, and some white. <br>
<sup>79</sup>Mary was very much pleased, and placed it beside her.<br>
<sup>80</sup>And now came Anne herself, accompanied by her second husband and a servant. <br>
<sup>81</sup>The Infant Jesus stretched out His little arms to her, and great was her joyful emotion. <br>
<sup>82</sup>Mary gave her a full account of all as she had done to Elizabeth. <br>
<sup>83</sup>They mingled their tears together, pausing at times to fondle the Infant Jesus.<br>
<sup>84</sup>Anne had brought with her many things for Mary and the Child, coverlets, swathing-bands, etc. <br>
<sup>85</sup>Although Mary had already received so many things from her, yet the Crib Cave was still quite poor in appearance, since whatever was at all unnecessary was given away at once. <br>
<sup>86</sup>Mary told Anne that the Kings from the East were approaching with rich gifts, and that their coming would attract much attention. <br>
<sup>87</sup>Anne, therefore, resolved to go and stay with her sister, who dwelt at some hours’ distance, and to return after the departure of the royal visitors. <br>
<sup>88</sup>Then I saw Joseph set to work to clear out the Crib Cave as well as those in its vicinity, in order to prepare for the arrival of the Kings whom Mary in spirit had seen coming. <br>
<sup>89</sup>He went also to Bethlehem to make the second payment of taxes and to look around for a dwelling, for he intended to settle in Bethlehem after Mary’s Purification.</p><br>
