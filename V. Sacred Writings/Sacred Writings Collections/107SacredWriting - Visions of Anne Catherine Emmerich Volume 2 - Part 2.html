<p class="chapterTitle">From the Nativity of the Virgin Mary to the death of patriarch Saint Joseph</p>

 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">Symbolical Vision</p>
                               
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I saw a slender pillar arise out of the earth. It was like the stalk of a flower, and like the calyx, or the capsule, of the poppy, I saw the octagonal church upon the top of this pillar. <br>
<sup>2</sup> The pillar arose through the center of the church and there, like a tree, divided into several branches. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Upon these branches stood the members of the Holy Family and their relatives. <br>
<sup>4</sup> They were indeed the central objects of veneration in this vision. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They stood as if on the stamens of flowers. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Anne stood above between two holy men, Joachim and her father, or some other member of her family. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Below St. Anne’s breast I saw a brilliant space almost in the shape of a heart. <br>
<sup>8</sup> In this light, I saw the figure of a shining child unfolding as it were, becoming larger. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Its hands were clasped upon its breast, its head inclined, and it constantly shed toward one quarter of the globe numerous rays of light. <br>
<sup>10</sup> I noticed with surprise that the rays did not stream in all directions. <br>
<sup>11</sup> On the surrounding branches and inclining toward this middle one, were adorers, and all around in the church, in groups and choirs innumerable, were saints inclining in prayer toward the holy central point. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The sweetness, fervor, and simplicity of this sacred service can be compared to nothing but a flowery field swayed toward the sun by a gentle breeze, and sending its perfumes and colors to those beams to which all flowers owe their gifts, yes, their existence itself. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Above this picture of the Immaculate Conception, arose the stem of grace. <br>
<sup>14</sup> It extended above Anne, and upon this stem, crown like sat Mary and Joseph. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Below them in adoration sat Anne. But above them all, on the very summit of the tree sat the Child Jesus in unfading splendor, the imperial globe in His hand. <br>
<sup>16</sup> In adoration around these groups, were first the choirs of the Apostles and disciples and, in more distant circles, those of the other saints. <br>
<sup>17</sup> High above all, I saw in the brightest light, figures and powers of indeterminate form, and over them something like a half-sun rayed out its beams. <br>
<sup>18</sup> This second picture seemed to signify the advent. <br>
<sup>19</sup> First I saw the region below and around the pillar, then I saw the church and its adorers, and lastly the child developing in the shining heart. <br>
<sup>20</sup> I received at the same time an unspeakable assurance of the sinless Conception. <br>
<sup>21</sup> I read it plainly as if in a book, and I comprehended it. <br>
<sup>22</sup> I was also informed that a church had once stood on this spot, but on account of its being the scene of many scandalous disputes on the subject of the Immaculate Conception, it had been given over to destruction. <br>
<sup>23</sup> The Church Triumphant, however, still celebrates the feast on its site. I heard also the words: “Every vision contains some mystery until its fulfillment.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Eve of Mary’s Birth</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> What gladness throughout all nature! Birds are singing, lambs and kids are gamboling, and swarms of doves are fluttering with joy around the spot upon which once stood Anne’s abode. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I see only a wilderness there at the present day … But I had a vision of pilgrims in the far-off times who, girded and with long staves in their hands, wended their way through the country to Mount Carmel.<br>
<sup>3</sup> On their head they wore a covering wound around like a turban. They, too, participated in the joy of nature. <br>
<sup>4</sup> And when in their astonishment they asked the hermits that dwelt in the neighborhood the cause of this remarkable exultation, they received for answer that such manifestations of gladness were customary. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They were always observed upon the eve of the anniversary of Mary’s birth around that spot where once stood Anne’s house. <br>
<sup>6</sup> The hermits told them of a holy man of the early times who had been the first to notice these wonders in nature. <br>
<sup>7</sup> His account gave rise to the cel-ebration of the feast of Mary’s Nativity which soon became general throughout the Church. <br>
<sup>8</sup> And now I, too, beheld how this came to pass.<br>
<sup>9</sup> I saw a pious pilgrim, two hundred and fifty years after Mary’s death, traversing the Holy Land, visiting and venerating all places connected with the actions of Jesus while on earth. <br>
<sup>10</sup> He was supernaturally guided. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Sometimes he tarried several days together in certain places in which he tasted extraordinary consolation. <br>
<sup>12</sup> There he prayed and meditated, and there also he received revelations from on high. <br>
<sup>13</sup> For several years he had, from the seventh to the eighth of September, noticed a great jubilation in nature and heard angelic voices singing in the air. <br>
<sup>14</sup> He prayed earnestly to know the meaning of all this, and it was made known to him in a vision that that was the birth night of the Blessed Virgin Mary. <br>
<sup>15</sup> He was on his way to Mount Sinai when he had this vision. <br>
<sup>16</sup> In it he was informed also of the existence of a chapel built in Mary’s honor in a cave of the Prophet Elias. <br>
<sup>17</sup> He was told to reveal this, as well as the circumstance of Mary’s birth night, to the hermits on Mount Sinai.<br>
<sup>18</sup> I saw him again when he arrived at the mount. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Where the convent now stands there dwelt, even at that early period, hermits scattered here and there. <br>
<sup>20</sup> It was then as inaccessible from the valley as it is now. <br>
<sup>21</sup> To reach the top of the mountain from that side, hoisting machines were used. <br>
<sup>22</sup> I saw that in consequence of the pilgrim’s communication, the eighth of September was here first celebrated in the year 250, and that later it was introduced into other parts of the Church.<br>
<sup>23</sup> I saw hermits accompanying the pilgrim to the cave of Elias to visit the chapel that had been built therein to Mary’s honor. <br>
<sup>24</sup> But it was not easy to find, for the mountain was covered with gardens that still produced magnificent fruits, though long allowed to run wild, and there were numerous caves of hermits and Essenians. <br>
<sup>25</sup> The pilgrim who had had the vision told them to send a Jew into the different caves, and that the one out of which he should be thrust would be the cave of Elias. <br>
<sup>26</sup> He had been thus instructed in vision. <br>
<sup>27</sup> I then saw them sending an old Jew into the caves; but, as often as he tried to enter a certain one that had a narrow entrance built up before it, he was repulsed. <br>
<sup>28</sup> By this miracle the cave of Elias was recognized. <br>
<sup>29</sup> On entering it they found another cave, the entrance to which had been closed by masonry; this was the chapel in which the Prophet Elias had in prayer honored the future Mother of the Saviour. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Many holy relics were still preserved in it, bones of the Prophets and Patriarchs, screens and vessels that had once been used in ceremonies of the Old Law. <br>
<sup>31</sup> These latter were appropriated to the use of the Church.<br>
<sup>32</sup> The spot upon which the thornbush had stood was called in the language of that country: It was entered only barefoot. <br>
<sup>33</sup> The Elias chapel was walled up with beautiful large stones through which ran flowerlike veining. <br>
<sup>34</sup> They were afterward employed for the erection of the church. <br>
<sup>35</sup> In the vicin-ity is a mountain entirely of red sand on which, nevertheless, there is very beautiful fruit.<br>
<sup>36</sup> I learned from St. Bridget that if pregnant women fast on the eve of Mary’s birth and say fervently nine Hail Marys to honor the nine months she passed in Anne’s womb; if they frequently repeat these prayers during their pregnancy, and especially on the eve of their delivery, receiving then the holy Sacraments devoutly, she will offer their prayer to God herself and bring them through even very critical circumstances to a happy delivery.<br>
<sup>37</sup> I saw the Blessed Virgin on the eve of her nativity. She said to me: “Whoever says this evening,” (Sept. 7th) “nine times the Hail Mary lovingly and devoutly to honor the nine months spent in my mother’s womb as also my birth, and continues the same devotion for nine consecutive days, daily gives to the angels nine flowers for a bouquet. <br>
<sup>38</sup> This bouquet they bear to Heaven and offer to the Most Holy Trinity to obtain some favor for the one that prays.”<br>
<sup>39</sup> I was transported to a high place between Heaven and earth. <br>
<sup>40</sup> I saw the earth below me gray and somber, and above me Heaven where, among the choirs of angels and the orders of the blessed, was the Blessed Virgin before the throne of God. <br>
<sup>41</sup> I saw prepared for her two thrones of honor, two buildings of honor, which finally became churches, yet, whole cities, and they were formed out of the prayers of earth. <br>
<sup>42</sup> They were built entirely of flowers, leaves, garlands, the various species typical of the different value and characteristics of the prayers of individuals and of whole congregations. <br>
<sup>43</sup> Angels and saints took them from the hands of those that offered them and bore them up to Heaven.
</p><br>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Birth of Mary</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> Several days previously, Anne informed Joachim that the time of her delivery was at hand. <br>
<sup>2</sup> She sent messengers to her sister Maraha, at Sephoris, also to the widow Enue, Elizabeth’s sister, in the valley of Zabulon, and to her sister Sobe’s daughter Salome, the wife of Zebedee, of Bethsaida. <br>
<sup>3</sup> The sons of Sobe and Zebedee, James the Greater and John, were not yet born. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Anne sent for these three women to come to her. <br>
<sup>5</sup> I saw them on their journey. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Two of them were accompanied by their husbands, who returned, however, when they had reached the neighborhood of Nazareth. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Joachim had sent the men servants off to the herds, and had otherwise disposed of the domestics not absolutely needed in the house. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Mary Heli, Anne’s eldest daughter, now the wife of Cleophas, took charge of the household affairs.<br>
<sup>9</sup> On the evening before the birth of the child, Joachim himself went to his herds in the field nearest his home. <br>
<sup>10</sup> I saw him with some of his servants who were related to him. <br>
<sup>11</sup> He called them brothers, but they were only his brother’s children. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The pasture grounds were beautifully divided off and hedged in. <br>
<sup>13</sup> In the corners were huts wherein the servants were provided with food supplied from Anne’s house. <br>
<sup>14</sup> There was also a stone altar before which they prayed. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Steps led down to it, and the space around it was neatly paved with triangular stones. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Behind the altar was a wall with steps at the sides. <br>
<sup>17</sup> The whole place was surrounded by trees.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Joachim, after praying here awhile, selected the finest lambs, kids, and bullocks from his herds, and sent them by his servants to the Temple as offerings. <br>
<sup>19</sup> He did not return to his home before night.<br>
<sup>20</sup> I saw the three women approaching Anne’s abode toward evening. <br>
<sup>21</sup> When they arrived, they went straight to her apartment back of the fireplace. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Anne embraced them, told them that her time drew near, and standing intoned with them a Psalm. <br>
<sup>23</sup> “Praise God, the Lord. <br>
<sup>24</sup> He has had pity on His people and has freed Israel. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Truly, He has fulfilled the promise that He made to Adam in Paradise: “The seed of the woman shall crush the serpent’s head.” <br>
<sup>26</sup> I do not remember all, verse for verse, but Anne rehearsed the different types of Mary, and said: “The germ that God gave to Abraham has ripened in me. <br>
<sup>27</sup> The promise made to Sara and the blossom of Aaron’s rod are fulfilled in me.” <br>
<sup>28</sup> During all this time, Anne was shining with light. <br>
<sup>29</sup> The room was full of glory, and over Anne hovered Jacob’s ladder. <br>
<sup>30</sup> The women around her were amazed, entranced. <br>
<sup>31</sup> I think they too saw the ladder.<br>
<sup>32</sup> And now a slight refreshment was placed before the visitors. <br>
<sup>33</sup> They ate and drank standing and toward midnight lay down to rest. <br>
<sup>34</sup> But Anne remained up in prayer. <br>
<sup>35</sup> After awhile, she went and roused the women. <br>
<sup>36</sup> She felt that her time was near, and she desired them to pray with her. <br>
<sup>37</sup> They all withdrew behind a curtain that concealed an oratory. <br>
<sup>38</sup> Anne opened the doors of a little closet built in the wall. <br>
<sup>39</sup> In it was a box containing sacred treasures, and on either side lights so contrived that they could be raised in their sockets at pleasure, and rested on upright supports. <br>
<sup>40</sup> These lamps were now lighted. <br>
<sup>41</sup> At the foot of the little altar was a cushioned stool. <br>
<sup>42</sup> The box contained some of Sara’s hair, which Anne held in great reverence; some of the bones of Joseph, which Moses had brought with him out of Egypt; something belonging to Tobias, relics of clothing, I think; and the little, white, shining, pear-shaped cup from which Abraham drank when he received the Blessing from the angel, and which was later on taken from the Ark of the Covenant and given to Joachim along with the Blessing. <br>
<sup>43</sup> This Blessing was like wine and bread, like a sacrament, like a supernatural, invigorating food. <br>
<sup>44</sup> Anne knelt before the shrine, one of the women on either side, and the third behind her. <br>
<sup>45</sup> Again I heard them reciting a Psalm. <br>
<sup>46</sup> I think that the burning bush on Horeb was mentioned in it. <br>
<sup>47</sup> And now a supernatural light began to fill the chamber and to hover around Anne. <br>
<sup>48</sup> The three women fell prostrate as if stunned. <br>
<sup>49</sup> Around Anne the light took the exact form of the thornbush on Horeb, so that I could no longer see her. <br>
<sup>50</sup> The flame streamed inward, and all at once I saw Anne receiving into her arms the shining child Mary. <br>
<sup>51</sup> She wrapped it in her mantle, pressed it to her heart, laid it on the stool before the relics, and went on with her prayer.<br>
<sup>52</sup> Then I heard the child crying, and I saw Anne drawing forth some linen from under the large veil that enveloped her. <br>
<sup>53</sup> She swathed the child first in gray and then in red, leaving the breast, arms, and head bare, and then the luminous thornbush vanished. <br>
<sup>54</sup> The holy women arose and in glad surprise received the newborn child into their arms. <br>
<sup>55</sup> They wept for joy. <br>
<sup>56</sup> All intoned a hymn of praise while Anne held the child on high. <br>
<sup>57</sup> I saw the chamber again filled with light and myriads of angels. <br>
<sup>58</sup> They announced the child’s name, singing: “On the twentieth day, this child shall be called Mary.” <br>
<sup>59</sup> Then they sang and I heard all these words.<br>
<sup>60</sup> Anne went to her chamber, and lay down upon her couch. <br>
<sup>61</sup> The women bathed and swathed the child, and laid it by the mother. <br>
<sup>62</sup> Next to the bed was a little portable basket-crib furnished with wooden pegs, by means of which it could be stuck into holes on the right or left, or at the foot of the bed as might be desired. <br>
<sup>63</sup> One of the women went and called Joachim. <br>
<sup>64</sup> He entered, knelt by Anne’s couch, and his tears fell in torrents over the child. <br>
<sup>65</sup> Then he took it up, held it aloft, and intoned a canticle of praise like unto that of Zachary. <br>
<sup>66</sup> He spoke words expressive of his longing now to die, and he alluded to the germ given by God to Abraham and perfected in himself, also to the root of Jesse. <br>
<sup>67</sup> I noticed, though not till afterward, that Mary Heli was not among the first to see the child. <br>
<sup>68</sup> She must at this time have been for some years the mother of Mary Cleophas. <br>
<sup>69</sup> Still she was not present at Mary’s birth, because the Jewish custom does not permit the daughter to be with the mother at such a time.<br>
<sup>70</sup> When Mary was born, I saw her at one and the same time before the Most Holy Trinity in Heaven and on earth in Anne’s arms. <br>
<sup>71</sup> I saw the joy of the whole heavenly court. <br>
<sup>72</sup> I saw all her gifts and graces in a supernatural way revealed to her. <br>
<sup>73</sup> I often have such visions, but they are for me inexpressible, for others unintelligible, therefore am I silent with regard to them. <br>
<sup>74</sup> Mary was also instructed in innumerable mysteries. <br>
<sup>75</sup> As this vision ended, the child cried upon earth.<br>
<sup>76</sup> I saw the news of Mary’s birth announced also in Limbo, and I beheld the transports of joy with which it was received by the Patriarchs, especially by Adam and Eve who rejoiced that the Promise made them in Paradise was now fulfilled. <br>
<sup>77</sup> I saw also that the Patriarchs increased in grace, their abode became lighter and less constrained, and that they began to exercise a greater influence on earth. <br>
<sup>78</sup> It was as if all their good works, all their penance, all the efforts of their life, all their desires and aspirations had at last brought forth fruit.<br>
<sup>79</sup> All nature, animate and inanimate, men and beasts were stirred to joy, and I heard sweet singing. <br>
<sup>80</sup> But sinners were filled with anguish and remorse. <br>
<sup>81</sup> I saw, especially around Nazareth and in other parts of Palestine, many possessed souls who at the hour of Mary’s birth became perfectly furious. <br>
<sup>82</sup> They uttered horrible cries, and they were tossed and dashed about. <br>
<sup>83</sup> The devils cried out of them: “We must withdraw! We must go out!”<br>
<sup>84</sup> My greatest delight was to see the old priest Simeon in the Temple on this night of Mary’s birth. <br>
<sup>85</sup> He was aroused by the fearful cries of the possessed confined in one of the streets on the Temple mountain. <br>
<sup>86</sup> Simeon with others had charge of them. <br>
<sup>87</sup> He went that night to the house in which they were, and asked the cause of those shrieks that roused everyone from sleep. <br>
<sup>88</sup> The possessed man nearest to the entrance cried out fiercely that he must get out. <br>
<sup>89</sup> Simeon released him, and then the devil cried out: “I must go forth! We must go forth! <br>
<sup>90</sup> A virgin is born, and there are upon earth so many angels who torment us. <br>
<sup>91</sup> We must go forth, and never again shall we dare possess a human being!” Then I saw the poor creature horribly tossed to and fro by the devil, who at last went out of him. <br>
<sup>92</sup> Simeon was in prayer. I rejoiced greatly at seeing old Simeon then.<br>
<sup>93</sup> I saw, too, Anna, the Prophetess, and another one of Mary’s future teachers in the Temple aroused and instructed in vision upon the birth of the child. They told each other what had happened. <br>
<sup>94</sup> I think they knew of Anne.<br>
<sup>95</sup> In the country of the Three Holy Kings, certain prophetesses had visions of the birth of the Blessed Virgin. <br>
<sup>96</sup> They told their priests that a Virgin was born, to welcome whom many spirits had come down upon earth, but that other spirits were troubled. <br>
<sup>97</sup> The stargazing Kings also saw pictures of it in their stars.<br>
<sup>98</sup> In Egypt, on the night of the birth, an idol was hurled from its temple into the sea, and another fell from its place and was dashed to pieces.<br>
<sup>99</sup> Next morning I saw a great crowd from the neighborhood around the house along with Anne’s servants, male and female. <br>
<sup>100</sup> The women in charge showed the child to them. <br>
<sup>101</sup> Many of them were very much affected, and many wicked hearts were changed. <br>
<sup>102</sup> They had gathered around the house because they had seen a light over it during the night and also because the birth of Anne’s child was looked upon as a great blessing.<br>
<sup>103</sup> Later on other relatives of Joachim from the valley of Zabulon arrived, also the servants from a distance. <br>
<sup>104</sup> The child was shown to all, and a repast was prepared in the house.<br>
<sup>105</sup> On the following days people flocked in numbers to see the child Mary. <br>
<sup>106</sup> Her little cradle, which was in the form of a boat, was placed upon a raised pedestal, something like a sawing-jack, in the front apartment. <br>
<sup>107</sup> The lower coverlet was red, the upper one white, and on them lay the child swathed up to the armpits in red and transparent white. <br>
<sup>108</sup> She had tiny, golden curls.<br>
<sup>109</sup> I saw also Mary Cleophas, the child of Mary Heli and Cleophas, the grandchild of Anne. <br>
<sup>110</sup> She was then a little girl of only a few years. <br>
<sup>111</sup> She was playing with the infant Mary and caressing her. <br>
<sup>112</sup> She was a stout, healthy child. <br>
<sup>113</sup> She wore a little white, sleeveless dress bordered with red from which hung tiny red balls, like apples. <br>
<sup>114</sup> Around her little bare arms were twined rows of white stuff, maybe feathers or silk or wool. <br>
<sup>115</sup> The child Mary had also a little transparent scarf around her neck.
</p><br>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Child Receives the Name of Mary</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> I saw a great feast in Anne’s house; all was gladness. <br>
<sup>2</sup> The wicker partitions in the front of the house had been taken away, and a large room was thusly made ready. <br>
<sup>3</sup> All around it ran a low table upon which stood plates, glasses, etc., but as yet no eatables. <br>
<sup>4</sup> In the middle of the room was an altar covered with red and white, and a stand upon which scrolls were laid. <br>
<sup>5</sup> A small basket-cradle stood on the altar. <br>
<sup>6</sup> It was shaped like a shell, and woven in white and red; the coverlet was sky-blue. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Priests from Nazareth were present in their sacred vestments; among them was one robed more magnificently than the rest. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Many of the female guests, relatives of Anne, were also in their holiday garments. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Among them were Anne’s eldest daughter Mary Heli, espoused to Cleophas, Anne’s sister from Sephoris, and others. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Several of Joachim’s relatives also were present. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Anne was up, but she did not appear. <br>
<sup>12</sup> She remained in her chamber behind the fireplace. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Enue, Elizabeth’s sister, brought the infant Mary, swathed as described in red and transparent white, and gave her to Joachim. <br>
<sup>14</sup> The priests approached the altar, the attendants bearing the chief priest’s train, and prayed from the scrolls. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Joachim placed the child on the arms of the chief priest, who held her aloft, prayed for awhile, and then laid her in the little cradle on the altar. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Then he took a pair of scissors, furnished with a little box at the end for catching the clippings, (something like a pair of snuffers), and cut a little hair from both sides and from the middle of the child’s head. <br>
<sup>17</sup> The hair thus removed, he burned it upon a pan of coals. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Then he took a box of oil and anointed the five senses of the child. <br>
<sup>19</sup> With his thumb, he pressed the ointment upon the ears, the eyes, the nose, the mouth, and the heart of the child. <br>
<sup>20</sup> He wrote the name Mary on a scrap of parchment, and laid it on the child’s breast. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Then the little Mary was, by Joachim, given back to Enue, who took her to Anne. <br>
<sup>22</sup> The women stood back during the ceremony, at the end of which other Psalms were sung. <br>
<sup>23</sup> I saw then all kinds of table furniture, dishes, etc., that I had not before noticed. <br>
<sup>24</sup> There were vessels on the table that were quite light, their covers pierced with holes. <br>
<sup>25</sup> I think they were baskets into which flowers were put. <br>
<sup>26</sup> On a side table, I saw numbers of little white rods, as if of bone, also spoons. <br>
<sup>27</sup> There were also bent tubes lying on it, but I know not for what use. <br>
<sup>28</sup> I saw no more of the meal itself.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Preparations for Mary’s Presentation</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> Mary was three years and three months old when she made the vow to join the virgins in the Temple. <br>
<sup>2</sup> She was very delicately built and had golden hair inclined to curl at the ends. <br>
<sup>3</sup> She was already as tall as a child of five or six here in our country. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Mary Heli’s daughter was a few years older than Mary, and much stronger and stouter. <br>
<sup>5</sup> I saw in Anne’s house the preparations for Mary’s admittance into the Temple. <br>
<sup>6</sup> It was made the occasion of a great feast. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Five priests had assembled from Nazareth, Sephoris, and other places, among them Zachary and a son of the brother of Anne’s father. <br>
<sup>8</sup> They were about to perform a sacred ceremony over the child Mary, a kind of examination as to whether she was sufficiently mature in mind to be admitted to the Temple. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Besides the priests, there were present Anne’s sister from Sephoris with her daughter Mary Heli and her child, and several other little girls and relatives.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The robes worn by the child at this feast were cut out by the priests themselves and the different parts quickly sewed together by the women present. <br>
<sup>11</sup> The child was clothed in them at certain periods when subjected to a series of interrogatories. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The ceremony was in itself very grave and solemn, although the faces of the aged priests were at times lit up by smiles of admiration at the expressions and answers of the little Mary, and it was frequently interrupted by the tears of Joachim and Anne. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Three entire suits were prepared for Mary and put on her at different times during the ceremony, the questioning and answering going on in the meantime. <br>
<sup>14</sup> All this took place in a large room next to the dining hall. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Light entered through a square opening in the center of the roof, which opening was often covered by a net. <br>
<sup>16</sup> The floor was covered with a red carpet. <br>
<sup>17</sup> In the middle of the room stood a table, intended for an altar, with a red cover, and over that a white transparent one. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Upon it lay a case with rolls of writings and a curtain upon which the picture of Moses was either embroidered or laid on and sewed down. <br>
<sup>19</sup> He was represented in the large mantle in which he used to pray, the tables of the Law hanging on his arm. <br>
<sup>20</sup> I have always seen Moses represented as a tall, broad-shouldered man. <br>
<sup>21</sup> He had a high, somewhat pyramidal head, a large hooked nose, and upon his broad, high forehead, were two bumps inclining toward each other and giving him a very remarkable appearance. <br>
<sup>22</sup> In his childhood, they were like little warts. <br>
<sup>23</sup> His complexion was brown, bright and ruddy, his hair inclined to red. <br>
<sup>24</sup> I saw many such protuberances as those possessed by Moses on the foreheads of the ancient Prophets and hermits; sometimes only one such excrescence appeared upon the middle of the forehead.<br>
<sup>25</sup> On the altar lay the three outfits for the child Mary along with various materials, etc., presented by the relatives for her dowry. <br>
<sup>26</sup> A kind of throne stood upon steps before the altar. <br>
<sup>27</sup> The priests entered the hall with naked feet. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Three of them only proceeded to the examination and blessed the child, who was as yet in her usual clothing. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Joachim and Anne were present with their relatives; the women stood back, the little girls at Mary’s side. <br>
<sup>30</sup> One of the priests took the garments from the altar, explained their signification, and handed them to Anne’s sister, from Sephoris, who put them on the child.<br>
<sup>31</sup> First came a little, yellow, knitted robe, and then a colored, laced bodice, which was put on over the head and fastened around the body. <br>
<sup>32</sup> It had on the breast something like cords. <br>
<sup>33</sup> Over that came a brownish mantle with armholes, from the upper part of which hung lappets. <br>
<sup>34</sup> It was cut out around the neck, and closed under the breast. <br>
<sup>35</sup> On her feet were brown sandals with thick, green soles. <br>
<sup>36</sup> Her reddish-yellow curls were arranged, and a silken crown with feathers in it placed upon them. <br>
<sup>37</sup> The feathers were a finger in length, and they bent over toward the inside of the crown. <br>
<sup>38</sup> I know to what bird in that country they belonged. <br>
<sup>39</sup> A large square, ash-colored kerchief was thrown over her head like a large veil. <br>
<sup>40</sup> It could be drawn together under the arms in such a way that they might rest in it as in slings. <br>
<sup>41</sup> It appeared to be a mantle used in time of prayer and penance, also in travelling.<br>
<sup>42</sup> The priests now put to the child all sorts of questions relative to the discipline enforced in the Temple. <br>
<sup>43</sup> Among other things, they said to her: “Thy parents, having promised thee to the Temple, have made a vow that thou shouldst drink no wine nor vinegar, shouldst eat no grapes nor figs. <br>
<sup>44</sup> Now what wilt thou add to this vow? Think upon this during thy meal.” <br>
<sup>45</sup> The Jewish people, and especially the young maidens were accustomed to drink vinegar. <br>
<sup>46</sup> Mary, too, was fond of it. On these and similar things, was she interrogated.<br>
<sup>47</sup> And now the second suit was put upon the child, It consisted of a sky-blue body, a mantle of the same color, but of a lighter shade, a richer bodice, and a white veil, glossy like silk, which fell behind in folds something like the consecrated veil of a nun. <br>
<sup>48</sup> Over this was a fine, closely-fitting wreath of colored flower buds made of silk and intermixed with small green leaves. <br>
<sup>49</sup> Then the priests threw over her face a white veil gathered on top like a cap. <br>
<sup>50</sup> It was caught by three clasps, one below the other, by means of which the veil could be raised upon the head, either one third, or one half, or even the whole.<br>
<sup>51</sup> The child was instructed upon the use of this veil, when to be raised or lowered in eating or answering questions. <br>
<sup>52</sup> In this array, Mary went to table where she sat between two of the priests, the third opposite to her. <br>
<sup>53</sup> The women and children sat at one end of the table apart from the men. <br>
<sup>54</sup> During the meal, the priests practiced the child in many points upon the use of the veil, asking questions and receiving her answers, and also in many other of the customary ceremonies. <br>
<sup>55</sup> They reminded her that she still could partake of everything, and they offered her different dishes, tempting her in order to see how far her abstinence would go. <br>
<sup>56</sup> But Mary excited their admiration by all that she did and said. <br>
<sup>57</sup> She tasted sparingly of only a few dishes, and answered all their questions with simplicity and wisdom. <br>
<sup>58</sup> During the meal and the whole of the examination, I saw angels hovering around her, directing and assisting her in all things.<br>
<sup>59</sup> After the repast, she was clothed anew before the altar in the next room. <br>
<sup>60</sup> Anne’s sister from Sephoris assisted the priest in the ceremony, during which the latter explained the signification of the garments and spoke of spiritual things. <br>
<sup>61</sup> The robes now put on the child were the most beautiful of all. <br>
<sup>62</sup> A violet-blue bodice, and over it a breast-piece embroidered in colors. <br>
<sup>63</sup> The latter was now fastened to the piece that covered the back, caught to the plaited skirt, and fell below in a point. <br>
<sup>64</sup> Over this fell a violet-blue mantle, full and magnificent, rounded in the back very much like a chasuble. <br>
<sup>65</sup> When it was closed on the breast, it formed puffs on the arms, like arches, wherein they could rest, and yet be exposed to view. <br>
<sup>66</sup> It had five rows of gold embroidery down the front, the middle one furnished with the buttons or hooks that fastened the mantle. <br>
<sup>67</sup> It was also embroidered around the edge. <br>
<sup>68</sup> A large changeable-colored veil was then put on, which glanced from white to violet-blue. <br>
<sup>69</sup> Upon this veil rested a crown, closed on top by five clasps. <br>
<sup>70</sup> It was a thin, broad circlet lined with gold, the upper edge spreading into points tipped with little balls. <br>
<sup>71</sup> A network of silk covered the outside, which was ornamented with small roses of the same material in whose center were fastened five pearls. <br>
<sup>72</sup> The five points also were of silk and surmounted by a ball. <br>
<sup>73</sup> The breast piece was fastened behind, yet had cords also in front as if for lacing. <br>
<sup>74</sup> Her mantle was caught first over the breast by a cross band, which was prevented from pressing upon the breast ornament by a button with a long shank; it closed again under the bodice and fell behind the arms in folds.<br>
<sup>75</sup> In this festive attire, Mary was placed upon the steps before the altar, the little girls at her side. <br>
<sup>76</sup> She now repeated her resolve to abstain from flesh, fish, and milk, to make use of only a certain drink prepared from the pith of a reed soaked in water. <br>
<sup>77</sup> This was much used by the poor of Palestine, just as here in our own country rice or barley water is drunk by them. <br>
<sup>78</sup> To this beverage, Mary proposed to add occasionally some terebinthine juice. <br>
<sup>79</sup> This juice is like a white, viscid oil and is very refreshing, though not in the same degree as balsam. <br>
<sup>80</sup> Mary expressed her resolution to refrain also from spices and fruits, with the exception of a kind of yellow berry that grows in bunches. <br>
<sup>81</sup> I know them well. <br>
<sup>82</sup> Children and poor people eat them in that country. <br>
<sup>83</sup> She said also that she would lie on the bare ground and nightly rise three times to pray. <br>
<sup>84</sup> The other maidens rose but once.<br>
<sup>85</sup> Upon hearing this, Anne and Joachim shed tears, and the aged Joachim pressed his child in his arms, saying: “Ah, my child, that is too hard! If thou livest so mortified a life, I, thy poor old father, shall never see thee again.” <br>
<sup>86</sup> This scene was very affecting.<br>
<sup>87</sup> But the priests replied to the child that she should, like the others, rise once only during the night, and they laid down other and milder conditions for her. <br>
<sup>88</sup> Finally, they said, “Many of the other virgins enter the Temple without a dowry or even wherewith to pay their board. <br>
<sup>89</sup> On this account and with their parents’ consent, they engage to wash the blood-besprinkled garments of the priests and the rough woolen cloths. <br>
<sup>90</sup> This is a very heavy work, and not accomplished without bleeding hands. But thou wilt never be called upon for such services, since thy parents are able to maintain thee at the Temple.”<br>
<sup>91</sup> But Mary quickly replied that she was ready even for this work, were she esteemed worthy to perform it. <br>
<sup>92</sup> At this speech, Joachim again betrayed his emotion.<br>
<sup>93</sup> During these holy ceremonies, I beheld Mary becoming at times so tall that she even rose above the heads of the priests. <br>
<sup>94</sup> This was for me a sign of her wisdom and grace. <br>
<sup>95</sup> The priests were filled with amazement, at once solemn and joyful.<br>
<sup>96</sup> At last, Mary was blessed by the priests. <br>
<sup>97</sup> I saw her radiant with light as she stood on the little altar throne, two priests on either side of her and one opposite. <br>
<sup>98</sup> They held rolls of writing, and prayed over the child, their hands outstretched above her. <br>
<sup>99</sup> At that moment, I saw a wonderful vision in the child Mary. <br>
<sup>100</sup> She seemed, by virtue of the blessing, to become transparent. <br>
<sup>101</sup> In her was a glory, a halo of unspeakable splendor, and in that halo appeared the Mystery of the Ark of the Covenant, as if in a glittering crystal vessel. <br>
<sup>102</sup> I saw Mary’s heart open like the doors of a temple, and the Holy Thing of the Ark of the Covenant, around which a tabernacle of precious stones of multiplied signification had been formed like a heavenly throne, going into her heart through that opening, like the Ark of the Covenant into the Holy of Holies, like the ostensorium into the tabernacle. <br>
<sup>103</sup> I saw that by this the child Mary was glorified; she hovered above the earth. <br>
<sup>104</sup> With the entrance of this Sacrament into Mary’s heart, which immediately closed over It, the vision faded, and I saw the child all penetrated by glowing fervor. <br>
<sup>105</sup> During this wonderful vision, I saw that Zachary received an interior assurance, a heavenly monition that Mary was the chosen vessel of the Mystery. <br>
<sup>106</sup> From it he had received a ray that had appeared figuratively in Mary.<br>
<sup>107</sup> And now the priests led the child to her parents. <br>
<sup>108</sup> Anne caught her child to her breast and kissed her, but Joachim—deeply affected—reverenced Mary and only took her hand. <br>
<sup>109</sup> The elder sister Mary Heli embraced the favored child with much more gaiety than did Anne, who was a very serious, practical, moderate, and self-possessed woman. <br>
<sup>110</sup> The little niece, Mary Cleophas, acted as any child would, and fondly embraced the little Mary.<br>
<sup>111</sup> Then the priests took the child again, disrobed her, and led her forth in her customary dress. <br>
<sup>112</sup> I saw them standing drinking out of a cup, and then departing.

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Journey to the Temple</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> I saw Joachim, Anne, and their elder daughter busied during the night packing and preparing for a journey. <br>
<sup>2</sup> A lamp with several wicks was burning, and I saw Mary Heli busily going about with a light. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Some days before, Joachim had sent his servants up to the Temple with offerings of cattle, five of the finest of every kind. <br>
<sup>4</sup> They made a nice herd. Now he saddled two of the beasts of burden, and loaded them with all kinds of baggage: clothes for the child and presents for the Temple. <br>
<sup>5</sup> A broad package was laid on the back of each beast, and formed a comfortable seat. <br>
<sup>6</sup> The baggage was all in bundles. <br>
<sup>7</sup> On both sides of one of the beasts platter-shaped baskets with arched covers were fastened. <br>
<sup>8</sup> In them were birds as large as partridges. <br>
<sup>9</sup> There were also oval baskets containing fruit. A cover with heavy tassels was thrown over the whole load.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Two of the priests were still present. <br>
<sup>11</sup> One was very old. <br>
<sup>12</sup> He wore a cap pointed on the forehead and with lappets over the ears. <br>
<sup>13</sup> His upper garment was shorter than the under one, and over it was a kind of stole. <br>
<sup>14</sup> He had much to do with the child. <br>
<sup>15</sup> The other priest was younger.<br>
<sup>16</sup> I saw also two boys present. <br>
<sup>17</sup> They were not human. <br>
<sup>18</sup> They appeared there supernaturally and with a spiritual signification. <br>
<sup>19</sup> They carried long standards rolled upon staffs furnished with knobs at both ends. <br>
<sup>20</sup> The larger of the two boys came to me with his standard unfurled, read, and explained it to me. <br>
<sup>21</sup> The writing appeared entirely strange to me, the single, golden letters all inverted. <br>
<sup>22</sup> One letter represented a whole word. <br>
<sup>23</sup> The language sounded unfamiliar, but I understood it all the same. <br>
<sup>24</sup> He showed me in his roll the passage referring to the burning thornbush of Moses. <br>
<sup>25</sup> He explained to me how the thornbush burned, and yet was not consumed; so now was the child Mary inflamed with the fire of the Holy Spirit, but in her humility she knew nothing of it. <br>
<sup>26</sup> It signifies also the Divinity and Humanity in Jesus, and how God’s fire united with the child Mary. <br>
<sup>27</sup> The putting-off of the shoes, he explained thus: “The Law will now be fulfilled. <br>
<sup>28</sup> The veil is withdrawn and the essence appears.” <br>
<sup>29</sup> By the little standard on his staff was signified, as he told me, that Mary now began her course, her career, to become the Mother of the Redeemer. <br>
<sup>30</sup> The other boy seemed to be playing with his standard. <br>
<sup>31</sup> He jumped about and ran around with it. <br>
<sup>32</sup> By this was signified Mary’s innocence. <br>
<sup>33</sup> The great Promise is to be fulfilled in her, rests upon her, and yet she plays like a child in this holy destiny. <br>
<sup>34</sup> I cannot express the loveliness of those boys. <br>
<sup>35</sup> They were different from all others present, and these latter did not appear to see them.<br>
<sup>36</sup> There were besides Anne about six female relatives with their children and some men who accom-panied them. <br>
<sup>37</sup> Joachim guided the beast, upon which the child Mary sometimes rode. <br>
<sup>38</sup> He carried a light, for it was still dark when they set out. <br>
<sup>39</sup> A servant led the other. The little procession was also accompanied by the other apparitions of the Prophets. <br>
<sup>40</sup> As Mary hastened from the house, they pointed out to me a place in their rolls, wherein it was declared that, although the Temple was indeed magnificent, yet Mary contained in herself still greater magnificence. <br>
<sup>41</sup> Mary wore the little yellowish gown and the large veil so fastened around her that her arms could rest in it. <br>
<sup>42</sup> When she rode, the Prophet boys followed behind her; but when she walked, they were at her side, singing the 44 and 49. <br>
<sup>43</sup> I knew that the same would be sung at her reception in the Temple. <br>
<sup>44</sup> The child Mary saw those boys, but she said nothing about it. <br>
<sup>45</sup> She was perfectly silent, wholly recollected in self.<br>
<sup>46</sup> The journey was difficult, over mountain and valley. <br>
<sup>47</sup> In the latter lay chilling mists and dew. <br>
<sup>48</sup> Once I saw the travelers resting at a fountain under some balsam trees, and again stopping overnight at an inn at the foot of a mountain.<br>
<sup>49</sup> Twelve leagues from Jerusalem, they came up at an inn with the herd that had been sent on in advance as an offering, and which was just about starting anew. <br>
<sup>50</sup> Joachim was well known here, and was quite at home. <br>
<sup>51</sup> When taking his offerings up to Jerusalem, he had always stopped at this inn; and when, from his penitential stay among the shepherds he returned to Nazareth, he had also put up here.<br>
<sup>52</sup> I again saw the holy travelers in the city Bethoron, six leagues from Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>53</sup> They had crossed a rivulet, had passed Gophna and Ozensara, and were still distant about two leagues from a road whence Jerusalem could be descried. <br>
<sup>54</sup> At Bethoron, they put up at a Levitical school. <br>
<sup>55</sup> Relatives of Joachim and Anne from Nazareth, Sephoris, Zabulon, and the co un – try around, had come hither with their daughters, and there was quite a little festival in Mary’s honor. <br>
<sup>56</sup> She was conducted with many other children to a hall in which a special place had been prepared for her on an elevated seat like a throne. <br>
<sup>57</sup> She was then crowned. <br>
<sup>58</sup> The teachers questioned her, and were struck with all her answers. <br>
<sup>59</sup> Mention was made of the wisdom of another maiden who not long since had returned from the Temple to her home at Gophna. <br>
<sup>60</sup> She was called Susanna, and I think that it was her place Mary was going to take in the Temple. <br>
<sup>61</sup> Susanna was then fifteen; later, she joined the holy women that followed Jesus.<br>
<sup>62</sup> Mary rejoiced at being now so near to the Temple. <br>
<sup>63</sup> Joachim embraced her, weeping and saying, “I shall never see thee again!” During the repast, Mary went here and there. <br>
<sup>64</sup> Several times she reclined by Anne’s side at table, or stood behind her with her arm around her neck.<br>
<sup>65</sup> On the following day, accompanied by the teacher of the Levitical school and his family, they started very early for Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>66</sup> The young girls carried beautiful fruits and garments as presents for the child. <br>
<sup>67</sup> It looked to me as if there was going to be a real feast in Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>68</sup> The nearer they approached the Holy City, the more eager and desirous became Mary. <br>
<sup>69</sup> She generally ran on before her parents.<br>
<sup>70</sup> I saw the arrival of the procession in Jerusalem, and also beheld the roads and paths and buildings more distinctly than I had done for a long time. <br>
<sup>71</sup> Jerusalem was a very singular-looking city. <br>
<sup>72</sup> We must not represent it to ourselves with its streets thronged as the great cities of the present day. <br>
<sup>73</sup> Many steep and hilly streets ran around behind the city walls, from which no gates led. <br>
<sup>74</sup> The houses lying high behind those walls faced the opposite side, for many parts of the city were built at subsequent periods, new ridges of hills being taken in accordingly. <br>
<sup>75</sup> The old city walls, however, were always allowed to remain standing. <br>
<sup>76</sup> Many of the deep valleys were spanned by massive stone arches. <br>
<sup>77</sup> The courtyards and rooms of the houses all opened toward the back of the building’ the entrance only being on the street. <br>
<sup>78</sup> The walls were surmounted by terraces or balconies. <br>
<sup>79</sup> The houses were kept closed the greater part of the time. <br>
<sup>80</sup> When the inhabitants had no affairs to call them to the public places of the city or to the Temple, they remained for the most part in their own houses and courts. <br>
<sup>81</sup> It was tolerably quiet on the streets, excepting in the neighborhood of the markets and palaces where there was much going to and fro of soldiers and travelers. <br>
<sup>82</sup> On certain days, at the time when all were gathered in the Temple for worship, the city in many localities was entirely deserted. <br>
<sup>83</sup> On this account and the seclusion of the people in their houses, Jesus and His disciples were enabled to go undisturbed through the solitary streets and deep valleys. <br>
<sup>84</sup> Water was not plentiful in the city; one often sees high buildings to and from which it was conveyed, also towers in which it was pumped. <br>
<sup>85</sup> They were very careful of water at the Temple where such quantities were needed for washing and purifying the various vessels, etc. They had great engines for pumping it up. <br>
<sup>86</sup> There were numbers of shopkeepers and merchants in the city; they had their booths all together in the markets and open squares. <br>
<sup>87</sup> So stood, for instance, not far from the sheep gate, many dealers in all kinds of gold trinkets and shining stones. <br>
<sup>88</sup> Their booths were round and light, and quite brown as if streaked with something, pitch or resin, probably. <br>
<sup>89</sup> Though light, they were very strong. <br>
<sup>90</sup> There they carried on their business and, under tents stretched from one to another, they exposed their different wares. <br>
<sup>91</sup> There were also certain localities, near the palaces for instance, where there was more life in the streets, where it was more brisk. <br>
<sup>92</sup> Old Rome was indeed more pleasantly situated. <br>
<sup>93</sup> It was not so steep, and its streets were more lively. <br>
<sup>94</sup> On one side of the mountain upon which the Temple was situated, the declivity was more gentle. <br>
<sup>95</sup> Here there were several streets upon terraces and on top of the thick walls, where some of the priests and servants of the Temple dwelt, as did some laboring people who performed the lowest services, such as purifying the ditches wherein was thrown the offal of the cattle slaughtered for the Temple. <br>
<sup>96</sup> On the other side, the mountain was very steep, and the ditch quite black. <br>
<sup>97</sup> Around the summit of the mountain was a green ledge whereon the priests had all kinds of little gardens. <br>
<sup>98</sup> Even in Christ’s time, there was upon certain parts of the Temple work constantly going on.<br>
<sup>99</sup> There were quantities of ore in the mountain upon which stood the Temple, and much was dug out and used in the building. <br>
<sup>100</sup> Inside the meadow were numbers of smelting vaults and furnaces. <br>
<sup>101</sup> I never felt at home in the Temple, for I never could find in it a place well-suited for prayer. <br>
<sup>102</sup> It was all so immensely solid, so massive, so high, the numerous courts were so narrow, dark, and obstructed by so many elevated platforms and seats, that, when the people were in it, it presented a somewhat frightful spectacle, and even looked confined with its high, massive walls and lofty pillars. <br>
<sup>103</sup> The constant slaughtering going on and the quantities of blood flowing in consequence, I found most repulsive, though words cannot express the wonderful order and cleanliness that reigned in everything connected with it.
</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Entrance into Jerusalem</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> I saw the caravan that conducted Mary approaching Jerusalem from the north, and winding toward the east around the outlying gardens and palaces of the city. <br>
<sup>2</sup> They crossed the valley of Josaphat and, leaving the road to Bethania on the left, entered the city by the sheep gate leading to the cattle market.<br>
<sup>3</sup> There was a pool here in which the sheep were washed. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Thence their way turned to the right and ran between walls to another section of the city. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Then they followed a long road through a valley, and at last reached the neighborhood of the fish market at the west side of the city. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Here stood the house at which Zachary, when engaged in the service of the Temple, always put up. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Out of this inn came men, women, and children with garlands to meet the caravan and to conduct them in ceremony to the house, about a quarter of an hour’s distance, at which they were to stop. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Zachary was not present, but I saw a very old man there, his father’s brother I think; and among those that came out to welcome Mary, were relatives with their children from the country around Hebron and Bethlehem. <br>
<sup>9</sup> There was a fine feast prepared for them in the house at which they stopped. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The child Mary wore the second festival suit with the little blue mantle.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Zachary called here for them, in order to take them to the feast inn that he had hired for them. <br>
<sup>12</sup> This was an inn which could be hired on festival occasions like the present. <br>
<sup>13</sup> There were four such inns on the northeast side of the mountain on which stood the Temple. <br>
<sup>14</sup> That hired by Zachary was very large. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Four halls surrounded a large court, along whose walls were sleeping places and long, low tables. <br>
<sup>16</sup> A spacious saloon and a kitchen were also prepared for the guests. <br>
<sup>17</sup> On two sides of this feast inn, dwelt some of the servants of the Temple, whose duty it was to see to the animals intended for sacrifice. <br>
<sup>18</sup> The court wherein was placed the herd that Joachim had brought as an offering, lay hard by.<br>
<sup>19</sup> A procession was formed when Zachary was about to lead the travelers into the inn hired for the feast. <br>
<sup>20</sup> He himself walked first with Joachim and Anne; then came Mary surrounded by four little girls in white, and followed by the other children and relatives. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Their way led to Herod’s palace and passed that of the Roman governor, leaving the citadel of Antonia behind; at last they reached a high wall, up which there was a flight of more than fifteen steps. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Mary, to the astonishment of all, mounted them without assistance. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Her friends wanted to help her, but she refused. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Upon their entrance into the inn, their feet were washed. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Then they were shown into a large hall in the center of which a lamp was suspended from the ceiling over a large, metal basin of water. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Here they washed their face and hands.<br>
<sup>27</sup> Joachim and Anne then went up with Mary to the dwelling of some of the priests. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Here, likewise urged by an interior spirit, the child hurried to mount the steps. <br>
<sup>29</sup> The two priests cordially received them into the house. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Both had been present at Mary’s examination in Nazareth. <br>
<sup>31</sup> They called one of the women belonging to the Temple, where she executed all kinds of works common to females, and educated little girls. <br>
<sup>32</sup> Her abode was at some distance from the Temple, among the added rooms forming the sleeping apartments of the Temple virgins. <br>
<sup>33</sup> Out of these rooms, one could—unseen—look down into the sanctuary. <br>
<sup>34</sup> The widow was so enveloped in her mantle that one could see only a little of her face. <br>
<sup>35</sup> The priests and the parents delivered the child Mary over to her as her future pupil. <br>
<sup>36</sup> She received her gravely, but cordially, while the child was all submission and reverence. <br>
<sup>37</sup> She (the widow) accompanied the party to the feast inn, and received a package as the child’s dowry.<br>
<sup>38</sup> The following day was taken up with preparations for Joachim’s sacrifice and for Mary’s entrance into the Temple.<br>
<sup>39</sup> Joachim went early with his offering of cattle to the Temple, in front of which the animals for the sacrifice were selected. <br>
<sup>40</sup> Those not chosen were at once led back to the cattle market. <br>
<sup>41</sup> Joachim had to lay his hand upon the head of each animal before it was slaughtered and he afterward received some of the flesh and blood of each. <br>
<sup>42</sup> There were in this place many pillars, tables, and vessels, where the sacrifices were cut up, divided, and arranged. <br>
<sup>43</sup> The scum of the blood was put aside; the fat, the spleen, and the liver separated, and all parts were salted. <br>
<sup>44</sup> The entrails of the lambs were cleaned, filled with something, and again restored to the animal so that it looked like a whole lamb. <br>
<sup>45</sup> The feet were bound crosswise. <br>
<sup>46</sup> A great portion of the meat was taken to a court in which were some of the Temple virgins. <br>
<sup>47</sup> They seemed to have something to do connected with it; perhaps they had to prepare it either for themselves or for the priests. <br>
<sup>48</sup> All was carried on with inde-scribable order. <br>
<sup>49</sup> The priests and Levites came and went, two and two; and during the difficult and multifarious work, all progressed as if by line and level. <br>
<sup>50</sup> The pieces prepared for sacrifice layover till the next day.<br>
<sup>51</sup> In the inn was held a feast, and there was also a repast, at which about one hundred people assisted along with the children, among them twenty-four girls of different ages. <br>
<sup>52</sup> Among others, I saw Seraphia, who was called Veronica after the death of Jesus. <br>
<sup>53</sup> She was already well-grown, probably from ten to twelve years old. <br>
<sup>54</sup> They prepared garlands and wreaths for Mary and her companions, and ornamented for them seven scepter-shaped lamps on whose summit burned a flame. <br>
<sup>55</sup> During the feast many priests and Levites went in and out of the inn, taking part also in the repast. <br>
<sup>56</sup> When they expressed surprise at the greatness of Joachim’s offering, he bade them recall the ignominy he had endured at the Temple when his former offerings were rejected, and the great mercy of God who had heard his supplications, and he asked them whether he should not now express his gratitude according to the extent of his power. <br>
