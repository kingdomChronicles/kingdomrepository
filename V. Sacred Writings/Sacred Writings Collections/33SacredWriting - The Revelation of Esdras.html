        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Word and Revelation of Esdras, the Holy Prophet and Beloved of God</p>
                
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> It came to pass in the thirtieth year, on the twenty-second of the month, I was in my house. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And I cried out and said to the Most High: Lord, give the glory, in order that I may see Your mysteries. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And when it was night, there came an angel, Michael the archangel, and says to me: O Prophet Esdras, refrain from bread for seventy weeks. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And I fasted as he told me. And there came Raphael the commander of the host, and gave me a storax rod. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And I fasted twice sixty weeks. And I saw the mysteries of God and His angels. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And I said to them: I wish to plead before God about the race of the Christians. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> It is good for a man not to be born rather than to come into the world. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> I was therefore taken up into heaven, and I saw in the first heaven a great army of angels; and they took me to the judgments. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> And I heard a voice saying to me: Have mercy on us, O you chosen of God, Esdras. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> Then began I to say: Woe to sinners when they see one who is just more than the angels, and they themselves are in the Gehenna of fire! <br>
        <sup>11</sup> And Esdras said: Have mercy on the works of Your hands, You who is compassionate, and of great mercy. <br>
        <sup>12</sup> Judge me rather than the souls of the sinners; for it is better that one soul should be punished, and that the whole world should not come to destruction. <br>
        <sup>13</sup> And God said: I will give rest in paradise to the righteous, and I have become merciful. <br>
        <sup>14</sup> And Esdras said: Lord, why do You confer benefits on the righteous? <br>
        <sup>15</sup> For just as one who has been hired out, and has served out his time, goes and again works as a slave when he come to his masters, so also the righteous has received his reward in the heavens. <br>
        <sup>16</sup> But have mercy on the sinners, for we know that You are merciful. And God said: I do not see how I can have mercy upon them. <br>
        <sup>17</sup> And Esdras said: They cannot endure Your wrath. <br>
        <sup>18</sup> And God said: This is the fate of such. <br>
        <sup>19</sup> And God said: I wish to have you like Paul and John, as you have given me uncorrupted the treasure that cannot be stolen, the treasure of virginity, the bulwark of men. <br>
        <sup>20</sup> And Esdras said: It is good for a man not to be born. It is good not to be in life. <br>
        <sup>21</sup> The irrational creatures are better than man, because they have no punishment; but You have taken us, and given us up to judgment. <br>
        <sup>22</sup> Woe to the sinners in the world to come! Because their judgment is endless, and the flame unquenchable. <br>
        <sup>23</sup> And while I was thus speaking to him, there came Michael and Gabriel, and all the apostles; and they said: Rejoice, O faithful man of God! And Esdras said: Arise, and come hither with me, O Lord, to judgment. <br>
        <sup>24</sup> And the Lord said: Behold, I give you my covenant between me and you, that you may receive it. <br>
        <sup>25</sup> And Esdras said: Let us plead in Your hearing. <br>
        <sup>26</sup> And God said: Ask Abraham your father how a son pleads with his father, and come plead with us. <br>
        <sup>27</sup> And Esdras said: As the Lord lives, I will not cease pleading with You in behalf of the race of the Christians. <br>
        <sup>28</sup> Where are Your ancient compassions, O Lord? Where is Your long-suffering? <br>
        <sup>29</sup> And God said: As I have made night and day, I have made the righteous and the sinner; and he should have lived like the righteous. <br>
        <sup>30</sup> And the prophet said: Who made Adam the first-formed? And God said: My undefiled hands. <br>
        <sup>31</sup> And I put him in paradise to guard the food of the tree of life; and thereafter he became disobedient, and did this in transgression. <br>
        <sup>32</sup> And the prophet said: Was he not protected by an angel? And was not his life guarded by the cherubim to endless ages? <br>
        <sup>33</sup> And how was he deceived who was guarded by angels? For You commanded all to be present, and to attend to what was said by You. <br>
        <sup>34</sup> But if You had not given him Eve, the serpent would not have deceived her; but whom You will You save, and whom You will You destroy. <br>
        <sup>35</sup> And the prophet said: Let us come, my Lord, to a second judgment. <br>
        <sup>36</sup> And God said: I cast fire upon Sodom and Gomorrha. <br>
        <sup>37</sup> And the prophet said: Lord, You deal with us according to our deserts. <br>
        <sup>38</sup> And God said: Your sins transcend my clemency. <br>
        <sup>39</sup> And the prophet said: Call to mind the Scriptures, my Father, who hast measured out Jerusalem, and set her up again. <br>
        <sup>40</sup> Have mercy, O Lord, upon sinners; have mercy upon Your own creatures; have pity upon Your works. <br>
        <sup>41</sup> Then God remembered those whom He had made, and said to the prophet: How can I have mercy upon them? <br>
        <sup>42</sup> Vinegar and gall did they give me to drink, Matthew 27:34 and not even then did they repent. <br>
        <sup>43</sup> And the prophet said: Reveal Your cherubim, and let us go together to judgment; and show me the day of judgment, what like it is. <br>
        <sup>44</sup> And God said: You have been deceived, Esdras; for such is the day of judgment as that in which there is no rain upon the earth; for it is a merciful tribunal as compared with that day. <br>
        <sup>45</sup> And the prophet said: I will not cease to plead with You, unless I see the day of the consummation. <br>
        <sup>46</sup> And God said: Number the stars and the sand of the sea; and if you shall be able to number this, you are also able to plead with me. <br>
        <sup>47</sup> And the prophet said: Lord, You know that I wear human flesh; and how can I count the stars of the heaven, and the sand of the sea? <br>
        <sup>48</sup> And God said: My chosen prophet, no man will know that great day and the appearing that comes to judge the world. <br>
        <sup>49</sup> For your sake, my prophet, I have told you the day; but the hour have I not told you. And the prophet said: Lord, tell me also the years. <br>
        <sup>50</sup> And God said: If I see the righteousness of the world, that it has abounded, I will have patience with them; but if not, I will stretch forth my hand, and lay hold of the world by the four quarters, and bring them all together into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and I will wipe out the race of men, so that the world shall be no more. <br>
        <sup>51</sup> And the prophet said: And how can Your right hand be glorified? And God said: I shall be glorified by my angels. <br>
        <sup>52</sup> And the prophet said: Lord, if You have resolved to do this, why did You make man? <br>
        <sup>53</sup> Thou said to our father Abraham, Genesis 22:17 Multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea-shore; and where is Your promise? <br>
        <sup>53</sup> And God said: First will I make an earthquake for the fall of four-footed beasts and of men; and when you see that brother gives up brother to death, and that children shall rise up against their parents, and that a woman forsakes her own husband, and when nation shall rise up against nation in war, then will you know that the end is near. Matthew 24 </p><br>

        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> For then neither brother pities brother, nor man wife, nor children parents, nor friends friends, nor a slave his master; for he who is the adversary of men shall come up from Tartarus, and shall show men many things. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> What shall I make of you, Esdras? <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And will you yet plead with me? <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And the prophet said: Lord, I shall not cease to plead with You. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And God said: Number the flowers of the earth. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> If you shall be able to number them, you are able also to plead with me. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And the prophet said: Lord, I cannot number them. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> I wear human flesh; but I shall not cease to plead with You. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> I wish, Lord, to see also the under parts of Tartarus. 
        <sup>10</sup> And God said: Come down and see. And He gave me Michael, and Gabriel, and other thirty-four angels; and I went down eighty-five steps, and they brought me down five hundred steps, and I saw a fiery throne, and an old man sitting upon it; and his judgment was merciless. 
        <sup>11</sup> And I said to the angels: Who is this? And what is his sin? And they said to me: This is Herod, who for a time was a king, and ordered to put to death the children from two years old and under. Matthew 2:16 
        <sup>12</sup> And I said: Woe to his soul! And again they took me down thirty steps, and I there saw boilings up of fire, and in them there was a multitude of sinners; and I heard their voice, but saw not their forms. 
        <sup>13</sup> And they took me down lower many steps, which I could not measure. 
        <sup>14</sup> And I there saw old men, and fiery pivots turning in their ears. 
        <sup>15</sup> And I said: Who are these? And what is their sin? And they said to me: These are they who would not listen. 
        <sup>16</sup> And they took me down again other five hundred steps, and I there saw the worm that sleeps not, and fire burning up the sinners. 
        <sup>17</sup> And they took me down to the lowest part of destruction, and I saw there the twelve plagues of the abyss. 
        <sup>18</sup> And they took me away to the south, and I saw there a man hanging by the eyelids; and the angels kept scourging him. 
        <sup>19</sup> And I asked: Who is this? And what is his sin? And Michael the commander said to me: This is one who lay with his mother; for having put into practice a small wish, he has been ordered to be hanged. 
        <sup>20</sup> And they took me away to the north, and I saw there a man bound with iron chains. 
        <sup>21</sup> And I asked: Who is this? And he said to me: This is he who said, I am the Son of God, that made stones bread, and water wine. 
        <sup>22</sup> And the prophet said: My lord, let me know what is his form, and I shall tell the race of men, that they may not believe in him. 
        <sup>23</sup> And he said to me: The form of his countenance is like that of a wild beast; his right eye like the star that rises in the morning, and the other without motion; his mouth one cubit; his teeth span long; his fingers like scythes; the track of his feet of two spans; and in his face an inscription, Antichrist. 
        <sup>24</sup> He has been exalted to heaven; he shall go down to Hades. Matthew 11:23 
        <sup>25</sup> At one time he shall become a child; at another, an old man. 
        <sup>26</sup> And the prophet said: Lord, and how do You permit him, and he deceives the race of men? And God said: Listen, my prophet. 
        <sup>27</sup> He becomes both child and old man, and no one believes him that he is my beloved Son. 
        <sup>28</sup> And after this a trumpet, and the tombs shall be opened, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible. 1 Corinthians 15:52 
        <sup>29</sup> Then the adversary, hearing the dreadful threatening, shall be hidden in outer darkness. 
        <sup>30</sup> Then the heaven, and the earth, and the sea shall be destroyed. 
        <sup>31</sup> Then shall I burn the heaven eighty cubits, and the earth eight hundred cubits. 
        <sup>32</sup> And the prophet said: And how has the heaven sinned? 
        <sup>33</sup> And God said: Since. ..there is evil. 
        <sup>34</sup> And the prophet said: Lord, and the earth, how has it sinned? And God said: Since the adversary, having heard the dreadful threatening, shall be hidden, even on account of this will I melt the earth, and with it the opponent of the race of men. 
        <sup>35</sup> And the prophet said: Have mercy, Lord, upon the race of the Christians. 
        <sup>36</sup> And I saw a woman hanging, and four wild beasts sucking her breasts. 
        <sup>37</sup> And the angels said to me: She grudged to give her milk, but even threw her infants into the rivers. 
        <sup>38</sup> And I saw a dreadful darkness, and a night that had no stars nor moon; nor is there there young or old, nor brother with brother, nor mother with child, nor wife with husband. 
        <sup>39</sup> And I wept, and said: O Lord God, have mercy upon the sinners. 
        <sup>40</sup> And as I said this, there came a cloud and snatched me up, and carried me away again into the heavens. 
        <sup>41</sup> And I saw there many judgments; and I wept bitterly, and said: It is good for a man not to have come out of his mother's womb. 
        <sup>42</sup> And those who were in torment cried out, saying: Since you have come hither, O holy one of God, we have found a little remission. 
        <sup>43</sup> And the prophet said: Blessed are they that weep for their sins. And God said: Hear, O beloved Esdras. 
        <sup>44</sup> As a husbandman casts the seed of the grain into the ground, so also the man casts his seed into the parts of the woman. 
        <sup>45</sup> The first month it is all together; the second it increases in size; the third it gets hair; the fourth it gets nails; the fifth it is turned into milk; and the sixth it is made ready, and receives life; the seventh it is completely furnished; the ninth the barriers of the gate of the woman are opened; and it is born safe and sound into the earth. 
        <sup>46</sup> And the prophet said: Lord, it is good for man not to have been born. 
        <sup>47</sup> Woe to the human race then, when You shall come to judgment! And I said to the Lord: Lord, why have You created man, and delivered him up to judgment? 
        <sup>48</sup> And God said, with a lofty proclamation: I will not by any means have mercy on those who transgress my covenant. 
        <sup>49</sup> And the prophet said: Lord, where is Your goodness? 
        <sup>50</sup> And God said: I have prepared all things for man's sake, and man does not keep my commandments. 
        <sup>51</sup> And the prophet said: Lord, reveal to me the judgments and paradise. 
        <sup>52</sup> And the angels took me away towards the east, and I saw the tree of life. 
        <sup>53</sup> And I saw there Enoch, and Elias, and Moses, and Peter, and Paul, and Luke, and Matthias, and all the righteous, and the patriarchs. 
        <sup>54</sup> And I saw there the keeping of the air within bounds, and the blowing of the winds, and the storehouses of the ice, and the eternal judgments. 
        <sup>55</sup> And I saw there a man hanging by the skull. 
        <sup>56</sup> And they said to me: This man removed landmarks. 
        <sup>57</sup> And I saw there great judgments. And I said to the Lord: O Lord God, and what man, then, who has been born has not sinned? 
        <sup>58</sup> And they took me lower down into Tartarus, and I saw all the sinners lamenting and weeping and mourning bitterly. 
        <sup>59</sup> And I also wept, seeing the race of men thus tormented. 
        <sup>60</sup> Then God says to me: Do you know, Esdras, the names of the angels at the end of the world? 
        <sup>61</sup> Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Gabuthelon, Aker, Arphugitonos, Beburos, Zebuleon.</p><br>


        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <br>
        <sup>1</sup> Then there came a voice to me: Come hither and die, Esdras, my beloved; give that which has been entrusted to you. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And the prophet said: And whence can you bring forth my soul? And the angels said: We can put it forth through the mouth. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And the prophet said: Mouth to mouth have I spoken with God, Deuteronomy 34:10 and it comes not forth thence. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And the angels said: Let us bring it out through your nostrils. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And the prophet said: My nostrils have smelled the sweet savour of the glory of God. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And the angels said: We can bring it out through your eyes. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And the prophet said: My eyes have seen the back parts of God. Exodus 33:23 <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And the angels said: We can bring it out through the crown of your head. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> And the prophet said: I walked about with Moses also on the mountain, and it comes not forth thence. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> And the angels said: We can put it forth through the points of your nails. <br>
        <sup>11</sup> And the prophet said: My feet also have walked about on the altar. <br>
        <sup>12</sup> And the angels went away without having done anything, saying: Lord, we cannot get his soul. <br>
        <sup>13</sup> Then He says to His only begotten Son: Go down, my beloved Son, with a great host of angels, and take the soul of my beloved Esdras. <br>
        <sup>14</sup> For the Lord, having taken a great host of angels, says to the prophet: Give me the trust which I entrusted to you; the crown has been prepared for you. <i>2 Timothy 4:8</i> <br>
        <sup>15</sup> And the prophet said: Lord, if Thou take my soul from me, who will be left to plead with You for the race of men? And God said: As you are mortal, and of the earth, do not plead with me. <br>
        <sup>16</sup> And the prophet said: I will not cease to plead. <br>
        <sup>17</sup> And God said: Give up just now the trust; the crown has been prepared for you. <br>
        <sup>18</sup> Come and die, that you may obtain it. <br>
        <sup>19</sup> Then the prophet began to say with tears: O Lord, what good have I done pleading with You, and I am going to fall down into the earth? <br>
        <sup>20</sup> Woe's me, woe's me, that I am going to be eaten up by worms! Weep, all you saints and you righteous, for me, who have pleaded much, and who am delivered up to death. <br>
        <sup>21</sup> Weep for me, all you saints and you righteous, because I have gone to the pit of Hades. <br>
        <sup>22</sup> And God said to him: Hear, Esdras, my beloved. I, who am immortal, endured a cross; I tasted vinegar and gall; I was laid in a tomb, and I raised up my chosen ones; I called Adam up out of Hades, that I might save the race of men. <br>
        <sup>23</sup> Do not therefore be afraid of death: for that which is from me — that is to say, the soul— goes to heaven; and that which is from the earth — that is to say, the body — goes to the earth, from which it was taken. Ecclesiastes 12:7 <br>
        <sup>24</sup> And the prophet said: Woe's me! woe's me! What shall I set about? <br>
        <sup>25</sup> What shall I do? I know not. <br>
        <sup>26</sup> And then the blessed Esdras began to say: O eternal God, the Maker of the whole creation, who hast measured the heaven with a span, and who holdest the earth as a handful, who ridest upon the cherubim, who took the prophet Elias to the heavens in a chariot of fire, who givest food to all flesh, whom all things dread and tremble at from the face of Your power — listen to me, who have pleaded much, and give to all who transcribe this book, and have it, and remember my name, and honour my memory, give them a blessing from heaven; and bless him in all things, as You blessed Joseph at last, and remember not his former wickedness in the day of his judgment. <br>
        <sup>27</sup> And as many as have not believed this book shall be burnt up like Sodom and Gomorrha. <br>
        <sup>28</sup> And there came to him a voice, saying: Esdras, my beloved, all things whatever you have asked will I give to each one. <br>
        <sup>29</sup> And immediately he gave up his precious soul with much honour, in the month of October, on the twenty-eighth. <br>
        <sup>30</sup> And they prepared him for burial with incense and psalms; and his precious and sacred body dispenses strength of soul and body perpetually to those who have recourse to him from a longing desire. <br>
        <sup>31</sup> To whom is due glory, strength, honour, and adoration — to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.
