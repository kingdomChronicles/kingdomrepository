        <!-------------------------------START OF LESSON 1  ------------------------------->
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
       
              
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And now, my son Methuselah, call to me all thy brothers<br>
                    And gather together to me all the sons of thy mother;<br>
                    For the word calls me,<br>
                    And the spirit is poured out upon me,<br>
                    That I may show you everything<br>
                    That shall befall you for ever. </p>

                    <p><sup>2</sup> And there upon Methuselah went and summoned to him all his brothers and assembled his relatives.<br></p>

                    <p><sup>3</sup> And he spake unto all the children of righteousness and said: </p>
                    
                    <p>Hear, ye sons of Enoch, all the words of your father,<br>
                    And hearken aright to the voice of my mouth;<br>
                    For I exhort you and say unto you, beloved: </p>

  	                <p><sup>4</sup> Love uprightness and walk therein.<br>
                    And draw not nigh to uprightness with a double heart,<br>
                    And associate not with those of a double heart, </p>
                    
                    <p>But walk in righteousness, my sons.<br>
                    And it shall guide you on good paths,<br>
                    And righteousness shall be your companion. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>5</sup> For I know that violence must increase on the earth,<br>
                    And a great chastisement be executed on the earth,<br>
                    And all unrighteousness come to an end: </p>
                    
                    <p>Yea, it shall be cut off from its roots,<br>
                    And its whole structure be destroyed. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And unrighteousness shall again be consummated on the earth,<br>
                    And all the deeds of unrighteousness and of violence<br>
                    And transgression shall prevail in a twofold degree. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And when sin and unrighteousness and blasphemy<br>
                    And violence in all kinds of deeds increase,<br>
                    And apostasy and transgression and uncleanness increase, </p>
                    
                    <p>A great chastisement shall come from heaven upon all these,<br>
                    And the holy Lord will come forth with wrath and chastisement<br>
                    To execute judgement on earth. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>8</sup> In those days violence shall be cut off from its roots,<br>
                    And the roots of unrighteousness together with deceit,<br>
                    And they shall be destroyed from under heaven. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And all the idols of the heathen shall be abandoned,<br>
                    And the temples burned with fire,<br>
                    And they shall remove them from the whole earth, </p>
                    
                    <p>And they (i.e. the heathen) shall be cast into the judgement of fire,<br>
                    And shall perish in wrath and in grievous judgement for ever. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And the righteous shall arise from their sleep,<br>
                    And wisdom shall arise and be given unto them. </p>
                    
                    <p>And after that the roots of unrighteousness shall be cut off, and the sinners shall be destroyed by the sword . . . shall be cut off from the blasphemers in every place, and
                    those who plan violence and those who commit blasphemy shall perish by the sword. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And now I tell you, my sons, and show you<br>
                    The paths of righteousness and the paths of violence.<br>
                    Yea, I will show them to you again<br>
                    That ye may know what will come to pass.<br>

                    <p><sup>12</sup> And now, hearken unto me, my sons,<br>
                    And walk in the paths of righteousness,<br>
                    And walk not in the paths of violence;<br>
                    For all who walk in the paths of unrighteousness shall perish for ever.</p>
 
                    
	<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
                  
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> The book written by Enoch-Enoch indeed wrote this complete doctrine of wisdom, (which is) praised of all men and a judge of all the earth </p>
                    
                    <p>for all my children who shall dwell on the earth. And for the future generations who shall observe uprightness and peace. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup> Let not your spirit be troubled on account of the times;<br>
                    For the Holy and Great One has appointed days for all things. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And the righteous one shall arise from sleep,<br>
                    Shall arise </p>
                    
                    <p>and walk in the paths of righteousness,<br>
                    And all his path and conversation shall be in eternal goodness and grace. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>4</sup> He will be gracious to the righteous and give him eternal uprightness,<br>
                    And He will give him power so that he shall be (endowed) with goodness and righteousness.<br>
                    And he shall walk in eternal light. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And sin shall perish in darkness for ever,<br>
                    And shall no more be seen from that day for evermore.</p>
                  
                    
	<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
                
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And after that Enoch both gave and began to recount from the books. And Enoch said: </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup>Concerning the children of righteousness and concerning the elect of the world,<br>
                    And concerning the plant of uprightness, I will speak these things,<br>
                    Yea, I Enoch will declare (them) unto you, my sons: </p>
                    
                    <p>According to that which appeared to me in the heavenly vision,<br>
                    And which I have known through the word of the holy angels,<br>
                    And have learnt from the heavenly tablets. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And Enoch began to recount from the books and said:<br>
                    I was born the seventh in the first week,<br>
                    While judgement and righteousness still endured. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And after me there shall arise in the second week great wickedness,<br>
                    And deceit shall have sprung up;<br>
                    And in it there shall be the first end. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And in it a man shall be saved;<br>
                    And after it is ended unrighteousness shall grow up,<br>
                    And a law shall be made for the sinners. </p>
                    
                    <p>And after that in the third week at its close<br>
                    A man shall be elected as the plant of righteous judgement,<br>
                    And his posterity shall become the plant of righteousness for evermore. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And after that in the fourth week, at its close,<br>
                    Visions of the holy and righteous shall be seen,<br>
                    And a law for all generations and an enclosure shall be made for them. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And after that in the fifth week, at its close,<br>
                    The house of glory and dominion shall be built for ever. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And after that in the sixth week all who live in it shall be blinded,<br>
                    And the hearts of all of them shall godlessly forsake wisdom. </p>
                    
                    <p>And in it a man shall ascend;<br>
                    And at its close the house of dominion shall be burnt with fire,<br>
                    And the whole race of the chosen root shall be dispersed. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And after that in the seventh week shall an apostate generation arise,<br>
                    And many shall be its deeds,<br>
                    And all its deeds shall be apostate. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And at its close shall be elected<br>
                    The elect righteous of the eternal plant of righteousness,<br>
                    To receive sevenfold instruction concerning all His creation. </p>

		                <p><sup>11</sup> For who is there of all the children of men that is able to hear the voice of the Holy One without being troubled ? And who can think His thoughts ? and who is there that
                    can behold all the works of heaven ?</p>

		                <p><sup>12</sup> And how should there be one who could behold the heaven, and who is there that could understand the things of heaven and see a
                    soul or a spirit and could tell thereof, or ascend and see all their ends and think them or do like them ?</p>

		                <p><sup>13</sup> And who is there of all men that could know what is the breadth and the length of the earth, and to whom has been shown the measure of all of them
                    ?</p>

		                <p><sup>14</sup> Or is there any one who could discern the length of the heaven and how great is its height, and upon what it is founded, and how great is the number of the stars, and
                    where all the luminaries rest?</p>

		   
	<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
   
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And now I say unto you, my sons, love righteousness and walk therein;<br>
                    For the paths of righteousness are worthy of acceptation,<br>
                    But the paths of unrighteousness shall suddenly be destroyed and vanish. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And to certain men of a generation shall the paths of violence and of death be revealed,<br>
                    And they shall hold themselves afar from them,<br>
                    And shall not follow them. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And now I say unto you the righteous:<br>
                    Walk not in the paths of wickedness, nor in the paths of death,<br>
                    And draw not nigh to them, lest ye be destroyed. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>4</sup> But seek and choose for yourselves righteousness and an elect life,<br>
                    And walk in the paths of peace,<br>
                    And ye shall live and prosper. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And hold fast my words in the thoughts of your hearts,<br>
                    And suffer them not to be effaced from your hearts; </p>
                    
                    <p>For I know that sinners will tempt men to evilly-entreat wisdom,<br>
                    So that no place may be found for her,<br>
                    And no manner of temptation may minish. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>6</sup> Woe to those who build unrighteousness and oppression<br>
                    And lay deceit as a foundation;<br>
                    For they shall be suddenly overthrown,<br>
                    And they shall have no peace. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>7</sup> Woe to those who build their houses with sin;<br>
                    For from all their foundations shall they be overthrown,<br>
                    And by the sword shall they fall.<br>
                    And those who acquire gold and silver in judgement suddenly shall perish. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>8</sup> Woe to you, ye rich, for ye have trusted in your riches,<br>
                    And from your riches shall ye depart,<br>
                    Because ye have not remembered the Most High in the days of your riches. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>9</sup> Ye have committed blasphemy and unrighteousness,<br>
                    And have become ready for the day of slaughter,<br>
                    And the day of darkness and the day of the great judgement. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>10</sup> Thus I speak and declare unto you:<br>
                    He who hath created you will overthrow you,<br>
                    And for your fall there shall be no compassion,<br>
                    And your Creator will rejoice at your destruction. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And your righteous ones in those days shall be<br>
                    A reproach to the sinners and the godless.</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> Oh that mine eyes were a cloud of waters<br>
                    That I might weep over you,<br>
                    And pour down my tears as a cloud of waters:<br>
                    That so I might rest from my trouble of heart! </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup> Who has permitted you to practice reproaches and wickedness ?<br>
                    And so judgement shall overtake you, sinners. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>3</sup> Fear not the sinners, ye righteous;<br>
                    For again will the Lord deliver them into your hands,<br>
                    That ye may execute judgement upon them according to your desires. </p>

                    Healing shall therefore be far from you because of your sins. </p>

                    And to those who weigh out injustice,<br>
                    For suddenly shall ye perish. </p>

                    For ye shall be delivered up and persecuted because of injustice,<br>
                    And heavy shall its yoke be upon you.</p>

		                <p><sup>1</sup> Observe the heaven, ye children of heaven, and every work of the Most High, and fear ye Him and work no evil in His presence.</p>

		                <p><sup>2</sup> If He closes the windows of heaven, and withholds the rain and the dew from descending on the earth on your account, what will ye do then?</p>

		                <p><sup>3</sup> And if He sends His anger upon you because of your deeds, ye cannot petition Him; for ye spake proud and insolent words against His righteousness: therefore ye shall have no peace.</p>

		                <p><sup>4</sup> And see ye not the sailors of the ships, how their ships are tossed to and fro by the waves, and are shaken by the winds, and are in sore trouble?</p>

		                <p><sup>5</sup> And therefore do they fear because all their goodly possessions go upon the sea with them, and they have evil forebodings of heart that the sea will swallow them and they will perish therein. </p>

		                <p><sup>6</sup> Are not the entire sea and all its waters, and all its movements, the work of the Most High, and has He not set limits to its doings, and confined it throughout by the sand?</p>

		                <p><sup>7</sup> And at His reproof it is afraid and dries up, and all its fish die and all that is in it; But ye sinners that are on the earth fear Him not.</p>

		                <p><sup>8</sup> Has He not made the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein? Who has given understanding and wisdom to everything that moves on the earth and in the sea. </p>

		                <p><sup>2</sup> And his body was white as snow and red as the blooming of a rose, and the hair of his head and his long locks were white as wool, and his eyes beautiful.</p>

		                <p><sup>3</sup> And when he opened his eyes, he lighted up the whole house like the sun, and the whole house was very bright.</p>

		                <p><sup>4</sup> And thereupon he arose in the hands of the midwife, opened his mouth, and conversed with the Lord of righteousness.</p>

		                <p><sup>5</sup> And his father Lamech was afraid of him and fled, and came to his father Methuselah. </p>
		
		                <p><sup>6</sup> And he said unto him: I have begotten a strange son, diverse from and unlike man, and resembling the sons of the God of heaven; and his nature is different and he is not like us, and his eyes are as the rays of the sun, and his countenance is glorious.</p>

		                <p><sup>7</sup> And it seems to me that he is not sprung from me but from the angels, and I fear that in his days a wonder may be wrought on the earth. </p>

		                <p><sup>8</sup> And now, my father, I am here to petition thee and implore thee that thou mayest go to Enoch, our father, and learn from him the truth, for his dwelling-place is amongst the angels. </p>

		                <p><sup>9</sup> And when Methuselah heard the words of his son, he came to me to the ends of the earth; for he had
                    heard that was there, and he cried aloud, and I heard his voice and I came to him.</p>

		                <p><sup>10</sup> And said unto him: Behold, here am I, my son, wherefore hast thou come to me ? </p>

		                <p><sup>11</sup> And he answered and said: Because of a great cause of anxiety have I come to thee, and because of a disturbing vision have I approached.</p>

		                <p><sup>12</sup> And now, my father, hear me: unto Lamech my son there hath been born a son, the like of whom there is none, and his nature is not like mans nature, and the colour of his body is whiter than snow and redder than the bloom of a rose, and the hair of his head is whiter than white wool, and his eyes are like the rays of the sun, and he opened his eyes and thereupon lighted up the whole house.</p>

		                <p><sup>13</sup> And he arose in the hands of the midwife, and opened his mouth and blessed the Lord of heaven. </p>

		                <p><sup>14</sup> And his father Lamech became afraid and fled to me, and did not believe that he was sprung from him, but that he was in the likeness of the angels of heaven; and behold I have come to thee that thou mayest make known to me the truth. </p>

		                <p><sup>15</sup> And I, Enoch, answered and said unto him: The Lord will do a new thing on the earth, and this I have already seen in a vision, and make known to thee that in the generation of my father Jared some of the angels of heaven transgressed the word of the Lord.</p>

		                <p><sup>16</sup>And behold they commit sin and transgress the law, and have united themselves with women and commit sin with them, and have married some of them, and have begot children by them.</p>

		                <p><sup>17</sup> And they shall produce on the earth giants not according to the spirit, but according to the flesh, and there shall be a great punishment on the earth, and the earth shall be cleansed from all impurity. </p>

		                <p><sup>19</sup>And this son who has been born unto you shall be left on the earth, and his three children shall be saved with him: when all mankind that are on the earth shall die he and his sons shall be saved.</p>
                    
		                <p><sup>20</sup> And now make known to thy son Lamech that he who has been born is in truth his son, and call his name Noah; for he shall be left to you, and he and his sons shall be saved from the destruction, which shall come upon the earth on account of all the sin and all the unrighteousness, which shall be consummated on the earth in his days. </p>

		                <p><sup>21</sup> And after that there shall be still more unrighteousness than that which was first consummated on the
                    earth; for I know the mysteries of the holy ones; for He, the Lord, has showed me and informed me, and I have read (them) in the heavenly tablets.</p>

		                <p><sup>2</sup> Ye who have done good shall wait for those days till an end is made of those who work evil; and an end of the might of the transgressors.</p>

		                <p><sup>3</sup> And wait ye indeed till sin has passed away, for their names shall be blotted out of the book of life and out of the holy books, and their seed shall be destroyed for ever, and their spirits shall be slain, and they shall cry and make lamentation in a place that is a chaotic wilderness, and in the fire shall they burn; for there is no earth there.</p>

		                <p><sup>4</sup> And I saw there something like an invisible cloud; for by reason of its depth I could not look over, and I saw a flame of fire blazing brightly, and things like shining mountains circling and sweeping to and fro. </p>

		                <p><sup>5</sup> And I asked one of the holy angels who was with me and said unto him: What is this shining thing? for it is not a heaven but only the flame of a blazing fire, and the voice of weeping and crying and lamentation and strong pain. </p>

                    <p><sup>6</sup> And he said unto me: This place which thou seest-here are cast the spirits of sinners and blasphemers, and of those who work wickedness, and of those who pervert everything that the Lord hath spoken through the mouth of the prophets-(even) the things that shall be. </p>

		                <p><sup>7</sup> For some of them are written and inscribed above in the heaven, in order that the angels may read them and know that which shall befall the sinners, and the spirits of the humble, and of those who have afflicted their bodies, and been recompensed by God; and of those who have been put to shame by wicked men: Who love God and loved neither gold nor silver nor any of the good things which are in the world, but gave over their bodies to torture.</p>

		                <p><sup>8</sup> Who, since they came into being, longed not after earthly food, but regarded everything as a passing breath, and lived accordingly, and the Lord tried them much, and their spirits were found pure so that they should bless His name. </p>

		                <p><sup>9</sup> And all the blessings destined for them I have recounted in the books.</p>

		                <p><sup>10</sup> And he hath assigned them their recompense, because they have been found to be such as loved heaven more than their life in the world, and though they were trodden under foot of wicked men, and experienced abuse and reviling from them and were put to shame, yet they blessed Me. </p>

		                <p><sup>11</sup> And now I will summon the spirits of the good who belong to the generation of light, and I will transform those who were born in darkness, who in the flesh were not recompensed with such honour as their faithfulness deserved. </p>

		                <p><sup>12</sup> And I will bring forth in shining light those who have loved My holy name, and I will seat each on the throne of his honour. </p>

		                <p><sup>13</sup> And they shall be resplendent for times without number; for righteousness is the judgement of God; for to the faithful He will give faithfulness in the habitation of upright paths. </p>

		                <p><sup>14</sup> And they shall see those who were, born in darkness led into darkness, while the righteous shall be resplendent. </p>

		                <p><sup>15</sup> And the sinners shall cry aloud and see them resplendent, and they indeed will go where days and seasons are prescribed for them. </p>
