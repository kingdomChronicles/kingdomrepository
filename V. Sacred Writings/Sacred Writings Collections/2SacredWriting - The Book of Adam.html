        <!-------------------------------START OF LESSON 1  ------------------------------->
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Discovery of Expulsion</p>
              
                    <p><sup>1</sup>It came to pass, when Adam went out from paradise with his wife Eve,  they went out at the eastern part of paradise.  And Adam made a hut to  live in.  They both entered (it) and resided there for seven days. They  both wept with abundant tears for they regretted the residences of the  kingdom from which they had been expelled.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And after seven "days, they were hungry and looked for something to eat.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> Eve told Adam:  "Adam,  my lord, arise and (go) search for food for me that we may eat, while  waiting to try -- who knows -- (that) for the Lord to accept us and take   us back to the same place in paradise.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup>  And Adam arose after  seven days and went about upon the face of the earth and he did not find    any food like that which they used to eat in paradise. Adam replied to  Eve and told her, "We are going to die a death."</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> Eve told Adam, "Oh, if I were dead then God would have accepted you in  paradise!" Adam replied to Eve and said to her, "Because of us a great  anger lies against (upon?) all creatures. (However) I do not know this:  whether it is because of me or because of you." Eve replied to Adam, "My    lord, if you think it wise, kill me so that I will be exterminated from  the sight of God and his angels, so that God's anger against you may  cease, which happened because of me: and he will bring you back into  paradise. </p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup> Adam replied and told her, "No, no! Do not mention this  matter, lest  God send another judgment upon us because of (this) killing. How could I    raise my hand and cause my own flesh to suffer?" Then Eve told him,  "Arise, let us both seek vegetables."</p>
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And they did not find (anything) tasting like the fruit of the tree  which was in paradise.</p>
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And Eve told him, "God created that for the (wild-)beasts to get their  food; but our food was that by which the angels live.</p>
                    <p><sup>9</sup> Now, come and let us repent in penitence for forty days, so that God may    pity us and then give us better food than that of the (dumb) animals,  lest we should become like them."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Penitence and Second Temptation</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> Adam replied to Eve and told her, "Explain to me now what penitence you  (wish to) repent, or for how many days will you be able to repent in your    penitence, lest, perchance, we make a promise to God and we be unable to fulfill the promise which we will have made to him."</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> Eve replied to Adam and she told him, "Tell me about the number of days   to me, then; For what period of time will you consider doing penitence --   who knows, (perhaps) I will add more to that --for it is I who have  brought these tribulations upon you."</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> Adam replied and said to Eve, "You will not be able to add (anything to   it).  On the contrary, hold to the number of days which I will tell you  and keep it.  And I will do penitence for forty days, and you, do  penitence for thirty-four days. Leave me these six days, since were you  not created upon the sixth day, when God completed the creation of all  creatures?  Now, You arise and go to the river Tigris; and put a stone  under your  feet and stay in the water and clothe yourself (with it) up to your neck.   While you pray, (beware) let no sound come from your mouth, for we are  not worthy to open our mouths, for our lips are impure because we  transgressed the commandments, concerning the food [so as to eat from the   tree] of paradise which God had forbidden us.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> Rather, be silent, only do penitence in the water for thirty-four days  with all your heart and I will do the same in the Jordan river, until God   hearkens and gives us food."</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> Eve went off to the Tigris river and she did as Adam had ordered  her.</p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup> But Adam, he remained in the Jordan river and the hair of his head  spread out.</p>
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And Adam said, "I tell you, O Jordan, suffer with me and assemble all  the (dumb-) animals which are around you, so that they (may come) to  surround you and bewail me, not for their own sakes, but for me. Because God did not  withhold their fodder from them, which God gave them from the beginning, but I have been withheld from my means of life and from my food."</p>
                    <p><sup>8</sup> When Adam had said that with bitter tears, all the cattle gathered close    to him and stood around him like walls. At the moment when the water (of) the Jordan had restrained its flow, then Adam raised his voice towards  God and he varied his tone of voice six times, like the voices of all the angels in all times.</p>
                    <p><sup>9</sup> When the twelve days of his weeping were completed, the devil trembled  and changed his shape and his clothes by his artful deceit. He went close    to Eve, on the Tigris river, and stood beside the bank.</p>
                    <p><sup>10</sup> He was weeping and had his false tears dripping (trickling) down on his    garment and from his garment down to the ground. Then he told Eve, "Come    out of that water (where you are) and stop your tribulations, for God has    hearkened to your penitence and to Adam your husband."</p>
                    <p><sup>11</sup> Moreover, we too have besought favor because of your misfortunes which  we have seen.</p>
                    <p><sup>12</sup> Thus God sent me to have you (plural) come forth and to give you the  food on account of which you repented.</p>
                    <p><sup>13</sup> Now, come upfrom there , for I have gone to Adam and he sent me and told    me,    'Go and speak with Eve, my spouse; bring her back to me.' Come,  now,   and I will lead you to Adam to the place where he is and where your food    also is."</p>
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And Eve came up out of the water and her flesh was withered like rotten vegetables because of the coldness of the water.  All the form of her  beauty had been destroyed.</p>
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And when she had come up out of the water, she fell on the face of the  earth in great weakness and remained lying (on the ground) without moving    for two days. And after two days she arose and the devil led her to where    Adam was.</p>
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And as soon as Adam saw Eve (and) how she was following the devil, he  started to weep with burning tears and called out with a great voice and    told her, "Where are the commands of repentance which I gave you? How  have you been deceived again by him, because of whom we are aliens to our    dwellings?"</p>
                    <p><sup>17</sup> When Eve heard that, that it was the devil who had deceived her, she  fell down before him and Adam's distress for Eve increased twofold for he    saw her lying on the earth like one dead.</p>
                    <p><sup>18</sup>He was sad and said, groaning, "Woe to you who fight against us!  What  evil have we done to you? For it is because of your calumnies that we  went out from paradise. Is it because we have caused you to be expelled  that you are angry against us?</p>
                    <p><sup>19</sup>Or is it because of us that you were despoiled of your glory? Or is it,  in some way, by our action that you are in such deficiency? Or are we the    only creatures of God that you fight against us alone?</p>

        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Fall of Satan</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup>  the devil began to cry with forced tears and the devil told Adam, "O  Adam, all the greed and the anger and all the grief of my heart are  directed against you because it was through you that I fell from my  dwellings, (it was) by you that I was alienated from my own throne. My  wings were more numerous than those of the Cherubim, and I concealed  myself under them. Because of you, now my feet walk on the earth, which I    would never have believed."</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> Adam replied to the devil and told him,</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> "What is my fault, by which I have done all that to you?"</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> The devil replied to him and told him, "You did nothing to me, but it is    because of you that I have fallen upon the earth."</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> The very day when you were created, on that day, I fell from before the    face of God, because when God breathed a spirit onto your face, you had  the image and likeness of the divinity. And then Michael came; he  presented you and made you bend down before God. And God told Michael, "I    have created Adam according to (my) image and my divinity."</p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup> Then Michael came; he summoned all the troops of angels and told them,  "Bow down before the likeness and the image of the divinity."</p>
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And then, when Michael summoned them and all had bowed down to you, he  summoned me also.</p>
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And I told him, "Go away from me, for I shall not bow down to him who is    younger than me; indeed, I am master prior to him and it is proper for  him to bow down to me. </p>
                    <p><sup>9</sup> The six classes of other angels heard that and my speech pleased them  and they did not bow down to you.</p>
                    <p><sup>10</sup> Then God became angry with us and commanded us, them and me, to be cast    down from our dwellings to the earth. As for you, he commanded you to  dwell in paradise.</p>
                    <p><sup>11</sup> When I had realized that I had fallen before you,[B, "by your power]   that I was in distress and you were in rest,</p>
                    <p><sup>12</sup>  then I aimed at hunting you so that I might alienate you from the  paradise of Delights, just as I had been alienated because of you.</p>
                    <p><sup>13</sup> When Adam heard that, he cried in a loud voice and said, "Lord, my life    is in your hands. Make this enemy distant from me, who desires to lead me    astray and seeks to destroy my race. It is by him that Eve has been  lost."</p>
                    <p><sup>14</sup> At that moment, Beliar became invisible.</p>
                    <p><sup>15</sup> As for Adam, he remained in the water and did repentance. But Eve had  fallen upon the earth like one dead. Then she stood up from the earth  (ground?)</p>


        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Separation of Adam and Eve</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> and told Adam, "Be saved, Adam, for you did not join me in the  transgression of the commandments, neither in the first (instance) nor in    the second. (But) the word of God will prevail against me." And Eve said    to him, "Behold, I shall so leave in the direction of the setting sun and    I will eat grass like a (dumb-)animal until I die, for by no means am I  worthy (of having a part) in the food of the living."</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> Then Eve went away in the direction of the setting sun and she remained there in mourning and moaning.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And after these days, she made for herself a hut in the direction of the    setting sun. Now she had conceived three months before, and Cain was in  her womb,</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> when the days of her parturition arrived, then she started to tremble;  she wailed towards God in a loud voice and said:</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> "Where is Adam so that he can console me in my present pain, or who will    relate  my sufferings to him? Is there none among the birds, who would go    to him and tell him,    'Come, help Eve, your spouse.' I beg of you, all you   races of heaven, and when you go to the east, relate my present  sufferings to my lord."</p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup> Then Adam heard in the river Jordan her crying of tears and misfortunes.</p>
                    <p><sup>7</sup> Then God hearkened to Adam's prayer and sent him the angel Michael who  brought him a seeds, sealed with the divine seal, destined to be brought    to Adam. Then he taught him sowing and the work related to it, so that  thus they might be saved, (they) and all their descendants.</p>
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And when Adam (had) heard the prayer of Eve and the wailing of her tears    from the west, Adam recognized her voice and said in his heart, "This is    the voice of my rib, the voice of my SHEEP (?); I will arise and I will  see why she cries. Is it that the serpent is attacking her again?"</p>
                    <p><sup>9</sup> Adam arose and followed her footsteps. And he came close to her, in the    part of the West where Eve was, and when Eve saw Adam, she was crying  with abundant tears and said, "My lord, Adam, have you not heard the  sound of my tears? For, today, it is nine days, day and night, that there    has been this crying of mine towards you. Is it that the generations of  the east have not informed you when they arose? And have not the birds of    the heavens and the beasts of the earth informed you, for I begged them  all that they tell you about it. Arise, entreat your Creator to have  pity, so that God may answer your prayer and deliver me from my  sufferings or, if it seems fitting to Him, send death to me or, by your  prayers, liberate me from my torments."</p>
                    <p><sup>10</sup> Adam prayed and spoke a plea to God on her behalf and the Lord hearkened to him.</p>
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And behold, twelve angels and two powers came from heaven. And they came to the place (where) Eve (was).</p>
                    <p><sup>12</sup> One of the powers came, touched Eve's face and her breast, and told Eve,    "Blessed are you, Eve, because of Adam, elect one and servant of God, for    his prayers are great before God and, because of him, God will deliver  you. If you had not been brought help because of him, you would have  conceived such a thorn that you could not have rescued yourself from your    sufferings. Rise up now and prepare yourself to give birth to a child."</p>
                    <p><sup>13</sup> Eve arose as the angel had instructed her: she gave birth to an child  and his color was like that of the stars. He fell into the hands of the  midwife and (at once) he began to pluck up the grass, for in his mother's    hut grass was planted.      
                    <p><sup>14</sup>  The midwife replied to him and told him, "God is just that he did not at    all leave you in my hands. For, you are Cain, the perverse one, killer of    the good,  for you are the one who plucks up the fruit-bearing tree, and    not him who plants it. You are the bearer of bitterness and not of  sweetness."</p>
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And the power told Adam, "Remain by Eve until she has done with the  infant what I have taught her. [so QAC, ag. K]"</p>


        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Death of Abel</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> As for Adam, he took Eve and the child and he brought them into a part  of the East and he stayed there. And when the eighth year and the second month were completed </p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> Eve became pregnant and bore another son whom the power of God called by name Abel, and they remained there together.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> At that time Eve told Adam,</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> "Adam, my lord, in my sleep I saw that the blood of my son Abel was  pouring into the mouth of Cain his brother and he drank it without mercy. And Abel beseeched him to leave him]a little of his blood,</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> and he did not agree to hearken to him but he drank it completely and  ]it did not remain in his stomach but it went forth and he was smeared  with it and it could not at all be removed from his body."</p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup> Adam replied to Eve and told her, "Lest Cain plan to kill him, let us  separate them from one another,</p>
                    <p><sup>7</sup> and let us be with them, so as to provide no room to anger." And they  acted as Adam had said, and he told (them), "My sons, come and let us  disperse, each to his own place." </p>
                    <p><sup>8</sup> Then God told the angel Gabriel, "Say to Adam: 'Do not reveal to Cain  the secret plan which you know, for he is a son of wrath, because his  brother will be killed by him!' However, let Adam not be sad, for  I will    raise up Seth for him instead of Abel, and he will resemble my image and    he, so QAC will teach you everything of which I have a memory. But do not    reveal this to anyone but Adam!"</p>
                    <p><sup>9</sup> That is what God told the angel and the angel spoke this word to Adam.  Then Adam kept the word in his heart. And they both were sad, Adam and  his spouse.</p>
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And the time arrived when Abel was killed by Cain his brother and he =  Adam told her = Eve, "God has established an end for all human beings.  Was death anything else but the killing by which Abel has been killed by    Cain and Cain's jealousy delivered him to death because Cain was of a  perverse race?"</p>
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And the times arrived when Cain and Abel had gone up towards their  fields. Two demons resembling Cain and Abel came. One demon reproached  the other demon. He became angry with him and took a stone sword, which  was of a transparent stone [maybe same stone as Ex 4:25]. He cut his  throat and killed him.</p>
                    <p><sup>12</sup> And when Cain saw the blood, he went quickly and took the stone in his  hand(s). But when Abel saw him coming upon him, he begged him, "Do not  make me die, O my brother Cain!" He, however, did not accept his prayer  and he spilled Abel's blood in front of him. And Adam and Eve afflicted  themselves all that time with great sadness.</p>
                    <p><sup>13</sup> And after this, Adam entered his spouse and Eve became pregnant and bore   Seth who resembled Adam.</p>
                    <p>Adam told Eve, "Behold, I have born a son in place of Abel, whom Cain  killed before me."</p>
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And again, after that, Adam had thirty sons and thirty daughters. For  all the years of Adam were 930 years.  And from him they multiplied over the earth and settled over it.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Illness of Adam</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And when the 930 years were completed   Adam fell ill and cried out in a loud voice and said, "Gather to me ]ye   all my descendants and I will see them before my death."</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And all his progeny gathered to him who had settled, and he divided the   three parts of the earth among his descendants. And all Adam's  descendants assembled by him, for they had taken a position before his  doors, in the place which Adam had made, and into which he would enter  and address his prayers to God.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And his sons told him, "What is this, Father Adam?"</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> He told  them, "I am  sick, my sons."  And they told him, "What is your illness and how does a   human being fall ill?"</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> Seth, his son, replied to him and told him, "Father Adam, what has  befallen you?  Have you remembered, perchance, the fruit of the Garden,  and you longed for it and you become sad yourself because of it?</p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup>If it is thus, tell me and I will go before paradise and I will cast  dust upon my head and I will weep. And, if only God hears me, let him  send his angel and he ]the angel will bring me the fruit of paradise and   I will bring it to you so that you may calm your distress."</p>
                    <p><sup>7</sup>And Adam told him, "My son Seth, it is not so, rather I am sick and I  have pain." Seth replied to him, "Father, what is pain and how do you  have pain?"</p>

        <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Adam's Story of the Fall</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> Adam told Seth, "Son, when God made us, me and your mother, he set us in   the the paradise of Delights to eat its fruit. But there was one plant in   the middle of paradise, ]very beautiful, concerning which God commanded  us,  'Eat not of it.'</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And the serpent deceived your mother and caused her to eat of it, because   of which, now, we are going to die. When it was the hour for the guardian   angels to ascend to worship God, the enemy deceived her and she ate of it and she deceived me, my children, for I did not know.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And God had divided (paradise) between us, between me and your mother  Eve, so that we might guard it. As for me, he had given me the eastern  and northern portion; to your mother Eve he had entrusted the southern  and the western portion.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And there were twelve angels with each of us to guard us until the time of the dawn, but at each (time, at) day, they ascended  (there). And at the moment of their ascent, the serpent deceived your  mother and caused her to eat of the tree, for he had seen that I was not with her any more than the angels.</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup>She also made me eat of it and I did not understand.</p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup>When we had eaten, God became angry with us and he told us,</p>
                    <p><sup>7</sup>'You have, therefore, scorned my commandment; I too will scorn you.' And   he sent 70 evils upon us, to our eyes, and to our ears and as far as our   feet, plagues and portents,  treasured in (his) treasuries. This God did   to me to cause me to perish through death."</p>

How did you take it upon  yourself to open your mouth and how have you (thought to) sink your  teeth? Or how have you not recalled the first order of God and have  opened your mouth against the image of God?"</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> Then the beast replied to her and told Eve,  "It is not from our  greed(iness) that your discontent and your weeping come, but your  discontent and your weeping come from your own greed(iness), for at the  beginning of creation, it was you who hearkened to the beast, the  serpent.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> How did you dare to open your mouth and eat of the tree of which God had    commanded you not to eat? (It is) you, (because of) whom (Mahe  emmendation) the aspect of everything has changed.</p>

                    <p><sup>6</sup> Seth replied to him and told the beast, "Let your mouth be closed and be silent, beast, and get away from us, the image of the divinity, until the    day when God will have you standing (before him)."</p>
                    <p><sup>7</sup> Then also the beast told Seth, "Behold, then, that I get away from you,  image of God, dazzling (splendor) of God." And when the beast had left  him (her?), the beast fled (far) from Seth and the wounded man went to  the hut of Adam his father."</p>

                    <p><sup>7</sup> I replied to him and told him, '(Yes), we eat all the fruit except for  only one tree which is here in the middle of paradise, for God commanded    us, 'Do not eat of it, so that you will not die of death.'</p>

                    <p><sup>4</sup> But I told the father, "On me shall be this blame. If He asks you, say  thus: 'This woman whom you have given me is to blame for that; (she  said:) See the flavor of this glory.'!</p>

                    <p><sup>5</sup> for the Lord will not forget me, but rather he will seek out the vessel which he has made. Arise and pray a prayer to God that my soul be  commended into the hands of my Creator. For I do not know how I am going    to reach the Creator of all, or whether he is angry with me or whether he    will accept me."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 26</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Eve's Confession</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> Then Eve arose and went out from Adam('s place). She did penitance and  said,</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> "I have sinned against you, God; I have sinned against you and I have  sinned before you. I have sinned before your elect angels. I have sinned    before the Cherubs. I have sinned before the altar of your holiness. I  have sinned before the generations of the heavens. I have sinned before  the birds of heavens. I have sinned before the beasts of the earth. I  have sinned against you, God, by all my greed, among all your creatures.    I beseech you all, you creatures of heaven and earth, beseech the Lord of    all for me." </p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> While Eve was on her (knees) to pray, suddenly Michael came, the angel  of mankind, he stood and raised Eve up, and told her,</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> "Arise from that penitence, for Adam your husband has gone forth from  the body. Arise and see his soul, how his Creator has already (got) it."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 27</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Angelic Liturgy</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> Eve arose and put her hand on her face and the angel went up again, and he told Eve, "Raise you eyes and abandon earthly concerns."</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> As for Eve, when she had raised her eyes towards the heavens, she saw  chariots of fire and a light which went up, (borne) by four (winds): they    were so resplendent that no word could express it, and it was impossible    to sound them out, neither from the front nor from the back. And angels  were proceeding before these chariots.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And when they had arrived (at the place) where the father was, the  chariot stopped and the Seraphs stood between him and the chariot(s).</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And I, Eve, saw three gold censers, and (three) cups and three angels  come quickly upon the altar. These angels took a burning coal and put it    in the censer and set the censer upon (the altar). And while they blew,  the smoke went up and veiled the frimaments of the heavens.</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> the angels were praising (God), they were bowing before him, crying out    and saying, "God, forgive Adam for he is your image and the work of your    hands: he is your creature."</p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup>  And I, Eve, saw two great lights prostrated in fear before God and I  wept and told my son Seth,</p>
                    <p><sup>7</sup> Rise from near your father's body, come towards me and see that which  your eyes have not seen, concerning  Adam your father."</p>
                    <p><sup>8</sup> Then Seth arose and went close to his mother Eve and told her, "Why are you weeping?</p>
                    <p><sup>9</sup> Raise your eyes and see the seven firmaments open and see the likeness  of the father Adam, as he lies before God and all the angels are  beseeching him and saying, 'God, forgive Adam, for he is your image and  your likeness, because it is you who have created him.'"</p>
                    <p><sup>10</sup> "What is this, then, my son Seth, do they deliver the blood of my spouse to these Indians, for they were  before God?"</p>
                    <p><sup>11</sup> Seth replied to Eve and told her, "No, mother, did you not    recognize those whom you called Indians in these colours of blood?" Eve  replied to him and told him, "I do not know them, my son."</p>
                    <p><sup>12</sup> Seth replied to her and told her, "These are the sun and the moon: they    are prostrated and they are beseeching for Adam, my father."</p>
                    <p><sup>13</sup> "Where is the light of the sun, for it is no more with it, or why is it    darkened thus?"</p>
                    <p><sup>14</sup> Seth replied to her and told Eve, "Because its light has been eclipsed  before the God of all and its light had become darkened by fear of God."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 28</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Assumption of Adam to Paradise</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> As Seth was telling that to Eve, at once a great angel blew the trumpet and all the angels who were prostrated on their faces stood up again. They besought Adam and cried out in a loud voice, and said,</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> "Blessed is God, by all blessing. You pardoned the protoplast."</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And when the angels had said these words,  one of the six-winged Seraphs was sent towards him (Adam). He took Adam to the lake of (A)cheron, and he dipped him in it three times.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> Then he led him back before God and (Adam) remained (prostrate) on his face for three hours. And after that, God stretched out his hand from his Throne, raised Adam up and gave him  to Michael, and he told him,</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup>"Take him to the third heaven, to paradise, and set him before the altar until the day of the "oikonomia" which I contemplate concerning all the  fleshly (beings) with my well beloved Son."</p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup> Then Michael took Adam to the place which God had commanded and all the angels were chanting angelic psalms. They were praising this wonder: the forgiveness of Adam and the promise of a future (life).</p>

        <h2>Chapter 29</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Adam and Abel's Funerary Rites</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> After which Michael cried out towards God, and God commanded that the trumpet be sounded and that all the angels  assemble before God, each one in his rank: those who held a censer; those    who held a psaltery; and those who sounded the trumpet.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And behold, the Lord of Sabaoth rose upon the winds of the Cherubs, and </p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And (God) first reached his paradise, and the flowers of paradise, with their sweet odors, were  moved at the sweet odor of the glorious God. All    the children of Adam were breathless, except only for Seth, for he was  son of the greatness of God.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And when the Lord had come to the body of Adam which had fallen in (the earth), the Lord was sorrowful for him and told him in a sad voice, "If  you had kept my commandments, you would not have fallen in that place and    your enemy would not have been able to see that he had caused you to be  expelled in that place.</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> But  I will change his joy into sorrow and I will lead you back towards this realm and I will set you upon your enemy's throne, where he was  seated, close (by the place) where his rebellion was discovered.</p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup> He will fall in the place (where) you (are) and he will see you in that (other) place sitting upon a throne."</p>
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And after that, God gave an command to Michael who took (Adam) back to paradise, which is in the third heaven.</p>
                    <p><sup>8</sup> They  seized three folded shrouds of (cloth) and God told Michael and Gabriel, "Unfold these shrouds and envelop Adam's body and take the ointment from    the olive tree and pour it upon him." And three angels dressed him (in  it) and when they had dressed Adam's body (in it),</p>
                    <p><sup>9</sup> God told them, "Take Abel's body as well, seize other shrouds and dress him in them also for he had remained lying naked since the day when wicked Cain killed  him.</p>
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And he wished to bury him in the earth and he was unable (to do so),   because his body came back out of the earth. For a voice made itself  heard from heaven and said to him,</p>
                    <p><sup>11</sup> "He will not be able to be buried in the earth before he who was created first has returned to the earth from which he was created."</p>
                    <p><sup>12</sup> Then he took it to a rock and it remained spread out there until the  death of Adam. Thus (the angels) took him and dressed him like his  father.</p>
                    <p><sup>13</sup> God commanded that both of them should be taken up to paradise, on the  eastern part, in the place from which God had taken some soil and created    Adam. And God commanded Michael to dig.</p>
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And God sent seven angels to paradise: they gathered much incense from  paradise and they brought them to them. Then they took both bodies, put  them into the grave and covered them (with earth).</p>
                    <p><sup>15</sup> Then God turned and called Adam. Adam's body answered him from the soil and said, "Here I am, (Lord)."</p>
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And the Lord told him, "Behold, as I told you, you are soil and you have returned to the soil, but I will raise you up in the resurrection which I have promised you,  at the time of resurrection.</p>
                    <p><sup>17</sup>Then, after that, God took the triangular seal and sealed the tomb of  Adam and he said, "Let no person touch it during these six days, until  your rib returns to you.</p>
                    <p><sup>18</sup>Then God reascended to the upper heaven and each  of the angels to his  office.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 30</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Eve's Prayer to Join Adam</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> But Eve grew numb when she saw (so Mahe) all that. Eve wept and wished  to see where they had put Adam, for she did not know. When the Lord had  descended upon the earth, the sweet odor of all the trees of paradise did    not (...) because of his sweet odor all had grown numb.  Until the  wrapping and the burial of Adam, nobody understood anything except Seth.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> Then Eve begged (and) wept so that (God) might lead her off, show her  the place where they had put Adam. And when she had completed her prayer, she said, </p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> "Lord, do not alienate me from Adam's place, but command me, me also, (to be) with him, as we both were in paradise, inseparable from one another.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> Do not separate us in our death, but place me where you have placed  him." And after this prayer she gave up her soul.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 31</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Eve's Funeral and Epilogue</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And the angel Michael came and taught Seth how to dress Eve. Three angels came and took Eve's body and placed it where they had placed  Adam's body.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And after that, the angel Michael told him, "Thus dress every dead  person who dies, until the death of all human beings."</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> When he had taught Seth all that, he ascended to the uppermost heaven,  far from Seth, and he told him, "Do not mourn for the dead more than five days and on the seventh day rejoice, for on that day God rested from all his (works) which the Lord had made."</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> To him is glory and honor and adoration, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever and for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
