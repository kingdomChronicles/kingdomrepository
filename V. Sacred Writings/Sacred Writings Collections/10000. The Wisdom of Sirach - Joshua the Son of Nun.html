  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"></p> -->

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> All wisdom comes from the Lord <br>
  and is with him for ever. <br>
  <sup>2</sup> The sand of the sea, the drops of rain, <br>
  and the days of eternity -- who can count them? <br>
  <sup>3</sup> The height of heaven, the breadth of the earth, 
  the abyss, and wisdom -- who can search them out? <br>
  <sup>4</sup> Wisdom was created before all things, <br>
  and prudent understanding from eternity.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> The root of wisdom -- to whom has it been revealed? <br>
  Her clever devices -- who knows them?<br>
  <sup>6</sup> There is One who is wise, greatly to be feared, <br>
  sitting upon his throne.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> The Lord himself created wisdom; <br>
  he saw her and apportioned her, <br>
  he poured her out upon all his works.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> She dwells with all flesh according to his gift, <br>
  and he supplied her to those who love him.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> The fear of the Lord is glory and exultation, <br>
  and gladness and a crown of rejoicing.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> The fear of the Lord delights the heart, <br>
  and gives gladness and joy and long life.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> With him who fears the Lord it will go well at the end; <br>
  on the day of his death he will be blessed.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; <br>
  she is created with the faithful in the womb.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> She made among men an eternal foundation, <br>
  and among their descendants she will be trusted.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> To fear the Lord is wisdom's full measure; <br>
  she satisfies men with her fruits;<br>
  <sup>15</sup> she fills their whole house with desirable goods, <br>
  and their storehouses with her produce.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, <br>
  making peace and perfect health to flourish.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> He saw her and apportioned her; <br>
  he rained down knowledge and discerning comprehension, <br>
  and he exalted the glory of those who held her fast.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom, <br>
  and her branches are long life.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> Unrighteous anger cannot be justified, <br>
  for a man's anger tips the scale to his ruin.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> A patient man will endure until the right moment, <br>
  and then joy will burst forth for him.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> He will hide his words until the right moment, <br>
  and the lips of many will tell of his good sense.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> In the treasuries of wisdom are wise sayings, <br>
  but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments, <br>
  and the Lord will supply it for you.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction, <br>
  and he delights in fidelity and meekness.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> Do not disobey the fear of the Lord; <br>
  do not approach him with a divided mind.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> Be not a hypocrite in men's sight, <br>
  and keep watch over your lips.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> Do not exalt yourself lest you fall, <br>
  and thus bring dishonor upon yourself. <br>
  The Lord will reveal your secrets <br>
  and cast you down in the midst of the congregation, <br>
  because you did not come in the fear of the Lord, <br>
  and your heart was full of deceit. </p><br><br>
  


  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> My son, if you come forward to serve the Lord, <br>
  prepare yourself for temptation.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Set your heart right and be steadfast, <br>
  and do not be hasty in time of calamity.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Cleave to him and do not depart, <br>
  that you may be honored at the end of your life.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Accept whatever is brought upon you, <br>
  and in changes that humble you be patient.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> For gold is tested in the fire, <br>
  and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Trust in him, and he will help you; <br>
  make your ways straight, and hope in him.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> You who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; <br>
  and turn not aside, lest you fall.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> You who fear the Lord, trust in him, <br>
  and your reward will not fail;<br>
  <sup>9</sup> you who fear the Lord, hope for good things, <br>
  for everlasting joy and mercy.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Consider the ancient generations and see: <br>
  who ever trusted in the Lord and was put to shame? <br>
  Or who ever persevered in the fear of the Lord <br>
  and was forsaken? <br>
  Or who ever called upon him and was overlooked?<br>
  <sup>11</sup> For the Lord is compassionate and merciful; <br>
  he forgives sins and saves in time of affliction.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Woe to timid hearts and to slack hands, <br>
  and to the sinner who walks along two ways!<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Woe to the faint heart, for it has no trust! <br>
  Therefore it will not be sheltered.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Woe to you who have lost your endurance! <br>
  What will you do when the Lord punishes you?<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Those who fear the Lord will not disobey his words, <br>
  and those who love him will keep his ways.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Those who fear the Lord will seek his approval, <br>
  and those who love him will be filled with the law.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Those who fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, <br>
  and will humble themselves before him.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Let us fall into the hands of the Lord, <br>
  but not into the hands of men; <br>
  for as his majesty is, <br>
  so also is his mercy. </p><br>

  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Listen to me your father, O children; <br>
  and act accordingly, that you may be kept in safety.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> For the Lord honored the father above the children, <br>
  and he confirmed the right of the mother over her sons.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Whoever honors his father atones for sins,<br>
  <sup>4</sup> and whoever glorifies his mother is like one <br>
  who lays up treasure.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Whoever honors his father will be gladdened <br>
  by his own children, <br>
  and when he prays he will be heard.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Whoever glorifies his father will have long life, <br>
  and whoever obeys the Lord will refresh his mother;<br>
  <sup>7</sup> he will serve his parents as his masters.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Honor your father by word and deed, <br>
  that a blessing from him may come upon you.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> For a father's blessing strengthens the houses of the children, <br>
  but a mother's curse uproots their foundations.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Do not glorify yourself by dishonoring your father, <br>
  for your father's dishonor is no glory to you.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> For a man's glory comes from honoring his father, <br>
  and it is a disgrace for children not to respect their mother.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> O son, help your father in his old age, <br>
  and do not grieve him as long as he lives;<br>
  <sup>13</sup> even if he is lacking in understanding, show forbearance; <br>
  in all your strength do not despise him.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> For kindness to a father will not be forgotten, <br>
  and against your sins it will be credited to you;<br>
  <sup>15</sup> in the day of your affliction it will be remembered <br>
  in your favor; <br>
  as frost in fair weather, your sins will melt away.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Whoever forsakes his father is like a blasphemer, <br>
  and whoever angers his mother is cursed by the Lord.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> My son, perform your tasks in meekness; <br>
  then you will be loved by those whom God accepts.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> The greater you are, the more you must humble yourself; <br>
  so you will find favor in the sight of the Lord.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> For great is the might of the Lord; <br>
  he is glorified by the humble.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> Seek not what is too difficult for you, <br>
  nor investigate what is beyond your power.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> Reflect upon what has been assigned to you, <br>
  for you do not need what is hidden.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Do not meddle in what is beyond your tasks, <br>
  for matters too great for human understanding <br>
  have been shown you.<br> 
  <sup>24</sup> For their hasty judgment has led many astray, <br>
  and wrong opinion has caused their thoughts to slip.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> A stubborn mind will be afflicted at the end, <br>
  and whoever loves danger will perish by it.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> A stubborn mind will be burdened by troubles, <br>
  and the sinner will heap sin upon sin.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> The affliction of the proud has no healing, <br>
  for a plant of wickedness has taken root in him.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> The mind of the intelligent man will ponder a parable, <br>
  and an attentive ear is the wise man's desire.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> Water extinguishes a blazing fire: <br>
  so almsgiving atones for sin.<br>
  <sup>31</sup> Whoever requites favors gives thought to the future; <br>
  at the moment of his falling he will find support. </p><br> <br>

  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> My son, deprive not the poor of his living, <br>
  and do not keep needy eyes waiting.<br> 
  <sup>2</sup> Do not grieve the one who is hungry, <br>
  nor anger a man in want.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Do not add to the troubles of an angry mind, <br>
  nor delay your gift to a beggar.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Do not reject an afflicted suppliant, <br>
  nor turn your face away from the poor.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Do not avert your eye from the needy, <br>
  nor give a man occasion to curse you;<br>
  <sup>6</sup> for if in bitterness of soul he calls down a curse upon you, <br>
  his Creator will hear his prayer.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Make yourself beloved in the congregation; <br>
  bow your head low to a great man.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Incline your ear to the poor, <br>
  and answer him peaceably and gently.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Deliver him who is wronged from the hand of the wrongdoer; <br>
  and do not be fainthearted in judging a case.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Be like a father to orphans, <br>
  and instead of a husband to their mother; <br>
  you will then be like a son of the Most High, <br>
  and he will love you more than does your mother.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Wisdom exalts her sons <br>
  and gives help to those who seek her.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Whoever loves her loves life, <br>
  and those who seek her early will be filled with joy.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Whoever holds her fast will obtain glory, <br>
  and the Lord will bless the place she enters.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Those who serve her will minister to the Holy One; <br>
  the Lord loves those who love her.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> He who obeys her will judge the nations, <br>
  and whoever gives heed to her will dwell secure.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> If he has faith in her he will obtain her; <br>
  and his descendants will remain in possession of her.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> For at first she will walk with him on tortuous paths, <br>
  she will bring fear and cowardice upon him, <br>
  and will torment him by her discipline <br>
  until she trusts him, <br>
  and she will test him with her ordinances.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Then she will come straight back to him and gladden him, <br>
  and will reveal her secrets to him.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> If he goes astray she will forsake him, <br>
  and hand him over to his ruin.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Observe the right time, and beware of evil; <br>
  and do not bring shame on yourself.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> For there is a shame which brings sin, <br>
  and there is a shame which is glory and favor.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> Do not show partiality, to your own harm, <br>
  or deference, to your downfall.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Do not refrain from speaking at the crucial time, <br>
  and do not hide your wisdom.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> For wisdom is known through speech, <br>
  and education through the words of the tongue.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> Never speak against the truth, <br>
  but be mindful of your ignorance.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> Do not be ashamed to confess your sins, <br>
  and do not try to stop the current of a river.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> Do not subject yourself to a foolish fellow, <br>
  nor show partiality to a ruler.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> Strive even to death for the truth <br>
  and the Lord God will fight for you.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> Do not be reckless in your speech, <br>
  or sluggish and remiss in your deeds.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> Do not be like a lion in your home, <br>
  nor be a faultfinder with your servants.<br>
  <sup>31</sup> Let not your hand be extended to receive, <br>
  but withdrawn when it is time to repay. </p><br> <br>

  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Do not set your heart on your wealth, <br>
  nor say, "I have enough."<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Do not follow your inclination and strength, <br>
  walking according to the desires of your heart.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Do not say, "Who will have power over me?" <br>
  for the Lord will surely punish you.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Do not say, "I sinned, and what happened to me?" <br>
  for the Lord is slow to anger.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Do not be so confident of atonement <br>
  that you add sin to sin.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Do not say, "His mercy is great, <br>
  he will forgive the multitude of my sins," <br>
  for both mercy and wrath are with him, <br>
  and his anger rests on sinners.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Do not delay to turn to the Lord, <br>
  nor postpone it from day to day; <br>
  for suddenly the wrath of the Lord will go forth, <br>
  and at the time of punishment you will perish.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Do not depend on dishonest wealth, <br>
  for it will not benefit you in the day of calamity.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Do not winnow with every wind, <br>
  nor follow every path: <br>
  the double-tongued sinner does that.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Be steadfast in your understanding, <br>
  and let your speech be consistent.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Be quick to hear, <br>
  and be deliberate in answering.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> If you have understanding, answer your neighbor; <br>
  but if not, put your hand on your mouth.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Glory and dishonor come from speaking, <br>
  and a man's tongue is his downfall.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Do not be called a slanderer, <br>
  and do not lie in ambush with your tongue; <br>
  for shame comes to the thief, <br>
  and severe condemnation to the double-tongued.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> In great and small matters do not act amiss, </p><br>

  <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> and do not become an enemy instead of a friend; <br>
  for a bad name incurs shame and reproach: <br>
  so fares the double-tongued sinner.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Do not exalt yourself through your soul's counsel, <br>
  lest your soul be torn in pieces like a bull.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> You will devour your leaves and destroy your fruit, <br>
  and will be left like a withered tree.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> An evil soul will destroy him who has it, <br>
  and make him the laughingstock of his enemies.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> A pleasant voice multiplies friends, <br>
  and a gracious tongue multiplies courtesies.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Let those that are at peace with you be many, <br>
  but let your advisers be one in a thousand.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> When you gain a friend, gain him through testing, <br>
  and do not trust him hastily.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> For there is a friend who is such at his own convenience, <br>
  but will not stand by you in your day of trouble.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> And there is a friend who changes into an enemy, <br>
  and will disclose a quarrel to your disgrace.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> And there is a friend who is a table companion, <br>
  but will not stand by you in your day of trouble.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> In prosperity he will make himself your equal, <br>
  and be bold with your servants;<br>
  <sup>12</sup> but if you are brought low he will turn against you, <br>
  and will hide himself from your presence.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Keep yourself far from your enemies, <br>
  and be on guard toward your friends.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> A faithful friend is a sturdy shelter: <br>
  he that has found one has found a treasure.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> There is nothing so precious as a faithful friend, <br>
  and no scales can measure his excellence.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> A faithful friend is an elixir of life; <br>
  and those who fear the Lord will find him.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Whoever fears the Lord directs his friendship aright, <br>
  for as he is, so is his neighbor also.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> My son, from your youth up choose instruction, <br>
  and until you are old you will keep finding wisdom.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Come to her like one who plows and sows, <br>
  and wait for her good harvest. <br>
  For in her service you will toil a little while, <br>
  and soon you will eat of her produce.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> She seems very harsh to the uninstructed; <br>
  a weakling will not remain with her.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> She will weigh him down like a heavy testing stone, <br>
  and he will not be slow to cast her off.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> For wisdom is like her name, <br>
  and is not manifest to many.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Listen, my son, and accept my judgment; <br>
  do not reject my counsel.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Put your feet into her fetters, <br>
  and your neck into her collar.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> Put your shoulder under her and carry her, <br>
  and do not fret under her bonds.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> Come to her with all your soul, <br>
  and keep her ways with all your might.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> Search out and seek, and she will become known to you; <br>
  and when you get hold of her, do not let her go.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> For at last you will find the rest she gives, <br>
  and she will be changed into joy for you.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> Then her fetters will become for you a strong protection, <br>
  and her collar a glorious robe.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> Her yoke is a golden ornament, <br>
  and her bonds are a cord of blue.<br>
  <sup>31</sup> You will wear her like a glorious robe, <br>
  and put her on like a crown of gladness.<br>
  <sup>32</sup> If you are willing, my son, you will be taught, <br>
  and if you apply yourself you will become clever.<br>
  <sup>33</sup> If you love to listen you will gain knowledge, <br>
  and if you incline your ear you will become wise.<br>
  <sup>34</sup> Stand in the assembly of the elders. <br>
  Who is wise? Cleave to him.<br>
  <sup>35</sup> Be ready to listen to every narrative, <br>
  and do not let wise proverbs escape you.<br>
  <sup>36</sup> If you see an intelligent man, visit him early; <br>
  let your foot wear out his doorstep.<br>
  <sup>37</sup> Reflect on the statutes of the Lord, <br>
  and meditate at all times on his commandments. <br>
  It is he who will give insight to your mind, <br>
  and your desire for wisdom will be granted. </p><br><br>

  <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Do no evil, and evil will never befall you.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Stay away from wrong, and it will turn away from you.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> My son, do not sow the furrows of injustice, <br>
  and you will not reap a sevenfold crop.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Do not seek from the Lord the highest office, <br>
  nor the seat of honor from the king.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Do not assert your righteousness before the Lord, <br>
  nor display your wisdom before the king.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Do not seek to become a judge, <br>
  lest you be unable to remove iniquity, <br>
  lest you be partial to a powerful man, <br>
  and thus put a blot on your integrity.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Do not offend against the public, <br>
  and do not disgrace yourself among the people.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Do not commit a sin twice; <br>
  even for one you will not go unpunished.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Do not say, "He will consider the multitude of my gifts, <br>
  and when I make an offering to the Most High <br>
  God he will accept it."<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Do not be fainthearted in your prayer, <br>
  nor neglect to give alms.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Do not ridicule a man who is bitter in soul, <br>
  for there is One who abases and exalts.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Do not devise a lie against your brother, <br>
  nor do the like to a friend.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Refuse to utter any lie, <br>
  for the habit of lying serves no good.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Do not prattle in the assembly of the elders, <br>
  nor repeat yourself in your prayer.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Do not hate toilsome labor, <br>
  or farm work, which were created by the Most High.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Do not count yourself among the crowd of sinners; <br>
  remember that wrath does not delay.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Humble yourself greatly, <br>
  for the punishment of the ungodly is fire and worms.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Do not exchange a friend for money, <br>
  or a real brother for the gold of Ophir.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Do not deprive yourself of a wise and good wife, <br>
  for her charm is worth more than gold.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Do not abuse a servant who performs his work faithfully, <br>
  or a hired laborer who devotes himself to you.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> Let your soul love an intelligent servant; <br>
  do not withhold from him his freedom.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> Do you have cattle? Look after them; <br>
  if they are profitable to you, keep them.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Do you have children? Discipline them, <br>
  and make them obedient from their youth.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Do you have daughters? Be concerned for their chastity, <br>
  and do not show yourself too indulgent with them.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> Give a daughter in marriage; you will have <br>
  finished a great task. <br>
  But give her to a man of understanding.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> If you have a wife who pleases you, do not cast her out; <br>
  but do not trust yourself to one whom you detest.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> With all your heart honor your father, <br>
  and do not forget the birth pangs of your mother.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> Remember that through your parents you were born; <br>
  and what can you give back to them that equals <br>
  their gift to you?<br>
  <sup>29</sup> With all your soul fear the Lord, <br>
  and honor his priests.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> With all your might love your Maker, <br>
  and do not forsake his ministers.<br>
  <sup>31</sup> Fear the Lord and honor the priest, <br>
  and give him his portion, as is commanded you: <br>
  the first fruits, the guilt offering, the gift <br>
  of the shoulders, <br>
  the sacrifice of sanctification, <br>
  and the first fruits of the holy things.<br>
  <sup>32</sup> Stretch forth your hand to the poor, <br>
  so that your blessing may be complete.<br>
  <sup>33</sup> Give graciously to all the living, <br>
  and withhold not kindness from the dead.<br>
  <sup>34</sup> Do not fail those who weep, <br>
  but mourn with those who mourn.<br>
  <sup>35</sup> Do not shrink from visiting a sick man, <br>
  because for such deeds you will be loved.<br>
  <sup>36</sup> In all you do, remember the end of your life, <br>
  and then you will never sin. </p><br> <br>

  <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Do not contend with a powerful man, <br>
  lest you fall into his hands.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Do not quarrel with a rich man, <br>
  lest his resources outweigh yours; <br>
  for gold has ruined many, <br>
  and has perverted the minds of kings.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Do not argue with a chatterer, <br>
  nor heap wood on his fire.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Do not jest with an ill-bred person, <br>
  lest your ancestors be disgraced.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Do not reproach a man who is turning away from sin; <br>
  remember that we all deserve punishment.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Do not disdain a man when he is old, <br>
  for some of us are growing old.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Do not rejoice over any one's death; <br>
  remember that we all must die.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Do not slight the discourse of the sages, <br>
  but busy yourself with their maxims; <br>
  because from them you will gain instruction <br>
  and learn how to serve great men.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Do not disregard the discourse of the aged, <br>
  for they themselves learned from their fathers; <br>
  because from them you will gain understanding <br>
  and learn how to give an answer in time of need.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Do not kindle the coals of a sinner, <br>
  lest you be burned in his flaming fire.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Do not get up and leave an insolent fellow, <br>
  lest he lie in ambush against your words.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Do not lend to a man who is stronger than you; <br>
  but if you do lend anything, be as one who has lost it.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Do not give surety beyond your means, <br>
  but if you give surety, be concerned as one who must pay.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Do not go to law against a judge, <br>
  for the decision will favor him because of his standing.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Do not travel on the road with a foolhardy fellow,
  lest he be burdensome to you; <br>
  for he will act as he pleases, <br>
  and through his folly you will perish with him.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Do not fight with a wrathful man, <br>
  and do not cross the wilderness with him; <br>
  because blood is as nothing in his sight, <br>
  and where no help is at hand, he will strike you down.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Do not consult with a fool, <br>
  for he will not be able to keep a secret.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> In the presence of a stranger do nothing that <br>
  is to be kept secret, <br>
  for you do not know what he will divulge.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Do not reveal your thoughts to every one, <br>
  lest you drive away your good luck. </p><br>

  <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Do not be jealous of the wife of your bosom,<br>
  and do not teach her an evil lesson to your own hurt.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Do not give yourself to a woman<br>
  so that she gains mastery over your strength.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Do not go to meet a loose woman,<br>
  lest you fall into her snares.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Do not associate with a woman singer,<br>
  lest you be caught in her intrigues.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Do not look intently at a virgin,<br>
  lest you stumble and incur penalties for her.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Do not give yourself to harlots<br>
  lest you lose your inheritance.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Do not look around in the streets of a city,<br>
  nor wander about in its deserted sections.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Turn away your eyes from a shapely woman,<br>
  and do not look intently at beauty belonging to another;<br>
  many have been misled by a woman's beauty,<br>
  and by it passion is kindled like a fire.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Never dine with another man's wife,<br>
  nor revel with her at wine;<br>
  lest your heart turn aside to her,<br>
  and in blood you be plunged into destruction.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Forsake not an old friend,<br>
  for a new one does not compare with him.<br>
  A new friend is like new wine;<br>
  when it has aged you will drink it with pleasure.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Do not envy the honors of a sinner,<br>
  for you do not know what his end will be.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Do not delight in what pleases the ungodly;<br>
  remember that they will not be held guiltless<br>
  as long as they live.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Keep far from a man who has the power to kill,<br>
  and you will not be worried by the fear of death.<br>
  But if you approach him, make no misstep,<br>
  lest he rob you of your life.<br>
  Know that you are walking in the midst of snares,<br>
  and that you are going about on the city battlements.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> As much as you can, aim to know your neighbors,<br>
  and consult with the wise.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Let your conversation be with men of understanding,<br>
  and let all your discussion be about the law of the Most High.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Let righteous men be your dinner companions,<br>
  and let your glorying be in the fear of the Lord.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> A work will be praised for the skill of the craftsmen;<br>
  so a people's leader is proved wise by his words.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> A babbler is feared in his city,<br>
  and the man who is reckless in speech will be hated. </p><br>

  <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> A wise magistrate will educate his people,<br>
  and the rule of an understanding man will be well ordered.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Like the magistrate of the people, so are his officials;<br>
  and like the ruler of the city, so are all its inhabitants.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> An undisciplined king will ruin his people,<br>
  but a city will grow through the understanding of its rulers.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> The government of the earth is in the hands of the Lord,<br>
  and over it he will raise up the right man for the time.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> The success of a man is in the hands of the Lord,<br>
  and he confers his honor upon the person of the scribe.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Do not be angry with your neighbor for any injury,<br>
  and do not attempt anything by acts of insolence.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Arrogance is hateful before the Lord and before men,<br>
  and injustice is outrageous to both.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Sovereignty passes from nation to nation<br>
  on account of injustice and insolence and wealth.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> How can he who is dust and ashes be proud?<br>
  for even in life his bowels decay.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> A long illness baffles the physician;<br>
  the king of today will die tomorrow.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> For when a man is dead,<br>
  he will inherit creeping things, and wild beasts, and worms.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> The beginning of man's pride is to depart from the Lord;<br>
  his heart has forsaken his Maker.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> For the beginning of pride is sin,<br>
  and the man who clings to it pours out abominations.<br>
  Therefore the Lord brought upon them extraordinary afflictions,<br>
  and destroyed them utterly.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> The Lord has cast down the thrones of rulers,<br>
  and has seated the lowly in their place.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> The Lord has plucked up the roots of the nations,<br>
  and has planted the humble in their place.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> The Lord has overthrown the lands of the nations,<br>
  and has destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> He has removed some of them and destroyed them,<br>
  and has extinguished the memory of them from the earth.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Pride was not created for men,<br>
  nor fierce anger for those born of women.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> What race is worthy of honor? The human race.<br>
  What race is worthy of honor? Those who fear the Lord.<br>
  What race is unworthy of honor? The human race.<br>
  What race is unworthy of honor? Those who<br>
  transgress the commandments.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Among brothers their leader is worthy of honor,<br>
  and those who fear the Lord are worthy of honor in his eyes.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> The rich, and the eminent, and the poor --<br>
  their glory is the fear of the Lord.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> It is not right to despise an intelligent poor man,<br>
  nor is it proper to honor a sinful man.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> The nobleman, and the judge, and the ruler will be honored,<br>
  but none of them is greater than the man who fears the Lord.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> Free men will be at the service of a wise servant,<br>
  and a man of understanding will not grumble.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> Do not make a display of your wisdom when you do your work,<br>
  nor glorify yourself at a time when you are in want.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> Better is a man who works and has an abundance of everything,<br>
  than one who goes about boasting, but lacks bread.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> My son, glorify yourself with humility,<br>
  and ascribe to yourself honor according to your worth.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> Who will justify the man that sins against himself?<br>
  And who will honor the man that dishonors his own life?<br>
  <sup>30</sup> A poor man is honored for his knowledge,<br>
  while a rich man is honored for his wealth.<br>
  <sup>31</sup> A man honored in poverty, how much more in wealth!<br>
  And a man dishonored in wealth, how much more in poverty! </p> <br><br>

  <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> The wisdom of a humble man will lift up his head,<br>
  and will seat him among the great.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Do not praise a man for his good looks,<br>
  nor loathe a man because of his appearance.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> The bee is small among flying creatures,<br>
  but her product is the best of sweet things.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Do not boast about wearing fine clothes,<br>
  nor exalt yourself in the day that you are honored;<br>
  for the works of the Lord are wonderful,<br>
  and his works are concealed from men.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Many kings have had to sit on the ground,<br>
  but one who was never thought of has worn a crown.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Many rulers have been greatly disgraced,<br>
  and illustrious men have been handed over to others.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Do not find fault before you investigate;<br>
  first consider, and then reprove.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Do not answer before you have heard,<br>
  nor interrupt a speaker in the midst of his words.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Do not argue about a matter which does not concern you,<br>
  nor sit with sinners when they judge a case.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> My son, do not busy yourself with many matters;<br>
  if you multiply activities you will not go unpunished,<br>
  and if you pursue you will not overtake,<br>
  and by fleeing you will not escape.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> There is a man who works, and toils, and presses on,<br>
  but is so much the more in want.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> There is another who is slow and needs help,<br>
  who lacks strength and abounds in poverty;<br>
  but the eyes of the Lord look upon him for his good;<br>
  he lifts him out of his low estate<br>
  <sup>13</sup> and raises up his head,<br>
  so that many are amazed at him.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Good things and bad, life and death,<br>
  poverty and wealth, come from the Lord.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> The gift of the Lord endures for those who are godly,<br>
  and what he approves will have lasting success.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> There is a man who is rich through his diligence<br>
  and self-denial,<br>
  and this is the reward allotted to him:<br>
  <sup>19</sup> when he says, "I have found rest,<br>
  and now I shall enjoy my goods!"<br>
  he does not know how much time will pass<br>
  until he leaves them to others and dies.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Stand by your covenant and attend to it,<br>
  and grow old in your work.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> Do not wonder at the works of a sinner,<br>
  but trust in the Lord and keep at your toil;<br>
  for it is easy in the sight of the Lord<br>
  to enrich a poor man quickly and suddenly.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> The blessing of the Lord is the reward of the godly,<br>
  and quickly God causes his blessing to flourish.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Do not say, "What do I need,<br>
  and what prosperity could be mine in the future?"<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Do not say, "I have enough,<br>
  and what calamity could happen to me in the future?"<br>
  <sup>25</sup> In the day of prosperity, adversity is forgotten,<br>
  and in the day of adversity, prosperity is not remembered.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> For it is easy in the sight of the Lord<br>
  to reward a man on the day of death according to his conduct.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> The misery of an hour makes one forget luxury,<br>
  and at the close of a man's life his deeds will be revealed.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> Call no one happy before his death;<br>
  a man will be known through his children.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> Do not bring every man into your home,<br>
  for many are the wiles of the crafty.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> Like a decoy partridge in a cage, so is the<br>
  mind of a proud man,<br>
  and like a spy he observes your weakness;<br>
  <sup>31</sup> for he lies in wait, turning good into evil,<br>
  and to worthy actions he will attach blame.<br>
  <sup>32</sup> From a spark of fire come many burning coals,<br>
  and a sinner lies in wait to shed blood.<br>
  <sup>33</sup> Beware of a scoundrel, for he devises evil,<br>
  lest he give you a lasting blemish.<br>
  <sup>34</sup> Receive a stranger into your home and he will <br>
  upset you with commotion, <br>
  and will estrange you from your family. </p><br><br>

  <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
   
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> If you do a kindness, know to whom you do it, <br>
  and you will be thanked for your good deeds.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Do good to a godly man, and you will be repaid -- <br>
  if not by him, certainly by the Most High.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> No good will come to the man who persists in evil<br>
  or to him who does not give alms.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Give to the godly man, but do not help the sinner.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Do good to the humble, but do not give to the ungodly; <br>
  hold back his bread, and do not give it to him, <br>
  lest by means of it he subdue you; <br>
  for you will receive twice as much evil <br>
  for all the good which you do to him.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> For the Most High also hates sinners <br>
  and will inflict punishment on the ungodly.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Give to the good man, but do not help the sinner.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> A friend will not be known in prosperity, <br>
  nor will an enemy be hidden in adversity.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> A man's enemies are grieved when he prospers, <br>
  and in his adversity even his friend will separate from him.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Never trust your enemy, <br>
  for like the rusting of copper, so is his wickedness.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Even if he humbles himself and goes about cringing, <br>
  watch yourself, and be on your guard against him; <br>
  and you will be to him like one who has polished a mirror, <br>
  and you will know that it was not hopelessly tarnished.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Do not put him next to you, <br>
  lest he overthrow you and take your place; <br>
  do not have him sit at your right, <br>
  lest he try to take your seat of honor, <br>
  and at last you will realize the truth of my words, <br>
  and be stung by what I have said.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Who will pity a snake charmer bitten by a serpent, <br>
  or any who go near wild beasts?<br>
  <sup>14</sup> So no one will pity a man who associates with a sinner <br>
  and becomes involved in his sins.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> He will stay with you for a time, <br>
  but if you falter, he will not stand by you.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> An enemy will speak sweetly with his lips, <br>
  but in his mind he will plan to throw you into a pit; <br>
  an enemy will weep with his eyes, <br>
  but if he finds an opportunity his thirst <br>
  for blood will be insatiable.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> If calamity befalls you, you will find him there ahead of you; <br>
  and while pretending to help you, he will <br>
  trip you by the heel;<br>
  <sup>18</sup> he will shake his head, and clap his hands, <br>
  and whisper much, and change his expression. </p><br><br>

  <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Whoever touches pitch will be defiled, <br>
  and whoever associates with a proud man will become like him.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Do not lift a weight beyond your strength, <br>
  nor associate with a man mightier and richer than you. <br>
  How can the clay pot associate with the iron kettle? <br>
  The pot will strike against it, and will itself be broken.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> A rich man does wrong, and he even adds reproaches; <br>
  a poor man suffers wrong, and he must add apologies.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> A rich man will exploit you if you can be of use to him, <br>
  but if you are in need he will forsake you.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> If you own something, he will live with you; <br>
  he will drain your resources and he will not care.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> When he needs you he will deceive you, <br>
  he will smile at you and give you hope. <br>
  He will speak to you kindly and say, "What do you need?"<br>
  <sup>7</sup> He will shame you with his foods, <br>
  until he has drained you two or three times; <br>
  and finally he will deride you. <br>
  Should he see you afterwards, he will forsake you, <br>
  and shake his head at you.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Take care not to be led astray, <br>
  and not to be humiliated in your feasting.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> When a powerful man invites you, be reserved; <br>
  and he will invite you the more often.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Do not push forward, lest you be repulsed; <br>
  and do not remain at a distance, lest you be forgotten.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Do not try to treat him as an equal, <br>
  nor trust his abundance of words; <br>
  for he will test you through much talk, <br>
  and while he smiles he will be examining you.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Cruel is he who does not keep words to himself; <br>
  he will not hesitate to injure or to imprison.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Keep words to yourself and be very watchful, <br>
  for you are walking about with your own downfall.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Every creature loves its like, <br>
  and every person his neighbor;<br>
  <sup>16</sup> all living beings associate by species, <br>
  and a man clings to one like himself.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> What fellowship has a wolf with a lamb? <br>
  No more has a sinner with a godly man.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> What peace is there between a hyena and a dog? <br>
  And what peace between a rich man and a poor man?<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Wild asses in the wilderness are the prey of lions; <br>
  likewise the poor are pastures for the rich.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Humility is an abomination to a proud man; <br>
  likewise a poor man is an abomination to a rich one.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> When a rich man totters, he is steadied by friends, <br>
  but when a humble man falls, he is even pushed <br>
  away by friends.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> If a rich man slips, his helpers are many; <br>
  he speaks unseemly words, and they justify him. <br>
  If a humble man slips, they even reproach him; <br>
  he speaks sensibly, and receives no attention.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> When the rich man speaks all are silent, <br>
  and they extol to the clouds what he says. <br>
  When the poor man speaks they say, "Who is this fellow?" <br>
  And should he stumble, they even push him down.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Riches are good if they are free from sin, <br>
  and poverty is evil in the opinion of the ungodly.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> A man's heart changes his countenance, <br>
  either for good or for evil.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> The mark of a happy heart is a cheerful face, <br>
  but to devise proverbs requires painful thinking. </p><br>

  <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
  

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man who does not blunder with his lips <br>
  and need not suffer grief for sin.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Blessed is he whose heart does not condemn him, <br>
  and who has not given up his hope.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Riches are not seemly for a stingy man; <br>
  and of what use is property to an envious man?<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Whoever accumulates by depriving himself, accumulates <br>
  for others; <br>
  and others will live in luxury on his goods.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> If a man is mean to himself, to whom will he be generous? <br>
  He will not enjoy his own riches.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> No one is meaner than the man who is grudging to himself, <br>
  and this is the retribution for his baseness;<br>
  <sup>7</sup> even if he does good, he does it unintentionally, <br>
  and betrays his baseness in the end.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Evil is the man with a grudging eye; <br>
  he averts his face and disregards people.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> A greedy man's eye is not satisfied with a portion, <br>
  and mean injustice withers the soul.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> A stingy man's eye begrudges bread, <br>
  and it is lacking at his table.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> My son, treat yourself well, according to your means, <br>
  and present worthy offerings to the Lord.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Remember that death will not delay, <br>
  and the decree of Hades has not been shown to you.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Do good to a friend before you die, <br>
  and reach out and give to him as much as you can.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Do not deprive yourself of a happy day; <br>
  let not your share of desired good pass by you.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Will you not leave the fruit of your labors to another, <br>
  and what you acquired by toil to be divided by lot?<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Give, and take, and beguile yourself, <br>
  because in Hades one cannot look for luxury.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> All living beings become old like a garment, <br>
  for the decree from of old is, "You must surely die!"<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Like flourishing leaves on a spreading tree <br>
  which sheds some and puts forth others, <br>
  so are the generations of flesh and blood: <br>
  one dies and another is born.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Every product decays and ceases to exist, <br>
  and the man who made it will pass away with it.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Blessed is the man who meditates on wisdom <br>
  and who reasons intelligently.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> He who reflects in his mind on her ways <br>
  will also ponder her secrets.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> Pursue wisdom like a hunter, <br>
  and lie in wait on her paths.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> He who peers through her windows <br>
  will also listen at her doors;<br>
  <sup>24</sup> he who encamps near her house <br>
  will also fasten his tent peg to her walls;<br>
  <sup>25</sup> he will pitch his tent near her, <br>
  and will lodge in an excellent lodging place;<br>
  <sup>26</sup> he will place his children under her shelter, <br>
  and will camp under her boughs;<br>
  <sup>27</sup> he will be sheltered by her from the heat, <br>
  and will dwell in the midst of her glory. </p><br>

  <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> The man who fears the Lord will do this, <br>
  and he who holds to the law will obtain wisdom.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> She will come to meet him like a mother, <br>
  and like the wife of his youth she will welcome him.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> She will feed him with the bread of understanding, <br>
  and give him the water of wisdom to drink.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> He will lean on her and will not fall, <br>
  and he will rely on her and will not be put to shame.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> She will exalt him above his neighbors, <br>
  and will open his mouth in the midst of the assembly.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> He will find gladness and a crown of rejoicing, <br>
  and will acquire an everlasting name.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Foolish men will not obtain her, <br>
  and sinful men will not see her.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> She is far from men of pride, <br>
  and liars will never think of her.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> A hymn of praise is not fitting on the lips of a sinner, <br>
  for it has not been sent from the Lord.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> For a hymn of praise should be uttered in wisdom, <br>
  and the Lord will prosper it.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Do not say, "Because of the Lord I left the right way"; <br>
  for he will not do what he hates.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Do not say, "It was he who led me astray"; <br>
  for he had no need of a sinful man.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> The Lord hates all abominations, <br>
  and they are not loved by those who fear him.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> It was he who created man in the beginning, <br>
  and he left him in the power of his own inclination.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> If you will, you can keep the commandments, <br>
  and to act faithfully is a matter of your own choice.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> He has placed before you fire and water: <br>
  stretch out your hand for whichever you wish.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Before a man are life and death, <br>
  and whichever he chooses will be given to him.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> For great is the wisdom of the Lord; <br>
  he is mighty in power and sees everything;<br>
  <sup>19</sup> his eyes are on those who fear him, <br>
  and he knows every deed of man.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> He has not commanded any one to be ungodly, <br>
  and he has not given any one permission to sin. </p><br> <br>

  <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Do not desire a multitude of useless children,<br>
  nor rejoice in ungodly sons.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> If they multiply , do not rejoice in them,<br>
  unless the fear of the Lord is in them.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Do not trust in their survival,<br>
  and do not rely on their multitude;<br>
  for one is better than a thousand,<br>
  and to die childless is better than to have ungodly children.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> For through one man of understanding a city<br>
  will be filled with people,<br>
  but through a tribe of lawless men it will be made desolate.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Many such things my eye has seen,<br>
  and my ear has heard things more striking than these.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> In an assembly of sinners a fire will be kindled,<br>
  and in a disobedient nation wrath was kindled.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> He was not propitiated for the ancient giants<br>
  who revolted in their might.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> He did not spare the neighbors of Lot,<br>
  whom he loathed on account of their insolence.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> He showed no pity for a nation devoted to destruction,<br>
  for those destroyed in their sins;<br>
  <sup>10</sup> nor for the six hundred thousand men on foot,<br>
  who rebelliously assembled in their stubbornness.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Even if there is only one stiff-necked person,<br>
  it will be a wonder if he remains unpunished.<br>
  For mercy and wrath are with the Lord;<br>
  he is mighty to forgive, and he pours out wrath.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> As great as his mercy, so great is also his reproof;<br>
  he judges a man according to his deeds.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> The sinner will not escape with his plunder,<br>
  and the patience of the godly will not be frustrated.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> He will make room for every act of mercy;<br>
  every one will receive in accordance with his deeds.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Do not say, "I shall be hidden from the Lord,<br>
  and who from on high will remember me?<br>
  Among so many people I shall not be known,<br>
  for what is my soul in the boundless creation?<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Behold, heaven and the highest heaven,<br>
  the abyss and the earth, will tremble at his visitation.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> The mountains also and the foundations of the earth<br>
  shake with trembling when he looks upon them.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> And no mind will reflect on this.<br>
  Who will ponder his ways?<br>
  <sup>21</sup> Like a tempest which no man can see,<br>
  so most of his works are concealed.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> Who will announce his acts of justice?<br>
  Or who will await them? For the covenant is far off."<br>
  <sup>23</sup> This is what one devoid of understanding thinks;<br>
  a senseless and misguided man thinks foolishly.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Listen to me, my son, and acquire knowledge,<br>
  and pay close attention to my words.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> I will impart instruction by weight,<br>
  and declare knowledge accurately.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> The works of the Lord have existed from the beginning by his<br>
  creation, and when he made them, he determined their divisions.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> He arranged his works in an eternal order,<br>
  and their dominion for all generations;<br>
  they neither hunger nor grow weary,<br>
  and they do not cease from their labors.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> They do not crowd one another aside,
  and they will never disobey his word.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> After this the Lord looked upon the earth,<br>
  and filled it with his good things;<br>
  <sup>30</sup> with all kinds of living beings he covered its surface,<br>
  and to it they return. </p><br><br>

  <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> The Lord created man out of earth, <br>
  and turned him back to it again.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> He gave to men few days, a limited time, <br>
  but granted them authority over the things upon the earth.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> He endowed them with strength like his own, <br>
  and made them in his own image.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> He placed the fear of them in all living beings, <br>
  and granted them dominion over beasts and birds.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> He made for them tongue and eyes; <br>
  he gave them ears and a mind for thinking.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> He filled them with knowledge and understanding, <br>
  and showed them good and evil.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> He set his eye upon their hearts <br>
  <sup>9</sup>to show them the majesty of his works.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> And they will praise his holy name, <br>
  to proclaim the grandeur of his works.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> He bestowed knowledge upon them, <br>
  and allotted to them the law of life.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> He established with them an eternal covenant, <br>
  and showed them his judgments.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Their eyes saw his glorious majesty, <br>
  and their ears heard the glory of his voice.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> And he said to them, "Beware of all unrighteousness." <br>
  And he gave commandment to each of them concerning <br>
  his neighbor.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Their ways are always before him, <br>
  they will not be hid from his eyes.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> He appointed a ruler for every nation, <br>
  but Israel is the Lord's own portion.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> All their works are as the sun before him, <br>
  and his eyes are continually upon their ways.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Their iniquities are not hidden from him, <br>
  and all their sins are before the Lord.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> A man's almsgiving is like a signet with the Lord <br>
  and he will keep a person's kindness like <br>
  the apple of his eye.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Afterward he will arise and requite them, <br>
  and he will bring their recompense on their heads.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Yet to those who repent he grants a return, <br>
  and he encourages those whose endurance is failing.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> Turn to the Lord and forsake your sins; <br>
  pray in his presence and lessen your offenses.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> Return to the Most High and turn away from iniquity, <br>
  and hate abominations intensely.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> Who will sing praises to the Most High in Hades, <br>
  as do those who are alive and give thanks?<br>
  <sup>28</sup> From the dead, as from one who does not exist, <br>
  thanksgiving has ceased; <br>
  he who is alive and well sings the Lord's praises.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> How great is the mercy of the Lord, <br>
  and his forgiveness for those who turn to him!<br>
  <sup>30</sup> For all things cannot be in men, <br>
  since a son of man is not immortal.<br>
  <sup>31</sup> What is brighter than the sun? Yet its light fails. <br>
  So flesh and blood devise evil.<br>
  <sup>32</sup> He marshals the host of the height of heaven; <br>
  but all men are dust and ashes. </p><br><br>

  <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> He who lives for ever created the whole universe;<br>
  <sup>2</sup> the Lord alone will be declared righteous.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> To none has he given power to proclaim his works;<br>
  and who can search out his mighty deeds?<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Who can measure his majestic power?<br>
  And who can fully recount his mercies?<br>
  <sup>6</sup> It is not possible to diminish or increase them,<br>
  nor is it possible to trace the wonders of the Lord.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> When a man has finished, he is just beginning,<br>
  and when he stops, he will be at a loss.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> What is man, and of what use is he?<br>
  What is his good and what is his evil?<br>
  <sup>9</sup> The number of a man's days is great if he reaches<br>
  a hundred years.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Like a drop of water from the sea and a grain of sand<br>
  so are a few years in the day of eternity.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Therefore the Lord is patient with them<br>
  and pours out his mercy upon them.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> He sees and recognizes that their end will be evil;<br>
  therefore he grants them forgiveness in abundance.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> The compassion of man is for his neighbor,<br>
  but the compassion of the Lord is for all living beings.<br>
  He rebukes and trains and teaches them,<br>
  and turns them back, as a shepherd his flock.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> He has compassion on those who accept his discipline<br>
  and who are eager for his judgments.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> My son, do not mix reproach with your good deeds,<br>
  nor cause grief by your words when you present a gift.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Does not the dew assuage the scorching heat? <br>
  So a word is better than a gift.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Indeed, does not a word surpass a good gift? <br>
  Both are to be found in a gracious man.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> A fool is ungracious and abusive,<br>
  and the gift of a grudging man makes the eyes dim.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Before you speak, learn, <br>
  and before you fall ill, take care of your health.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Before judgment, examine yourself, <br>
  and in the hour of visitation you will find forgiveness.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> Before falling ill, humble yourself, <br>
  and when you are on the point of sinning, turn back.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> Let nothing hinder you from paying a vow promptly, <br>
  and do not wait until death to be released from it.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Before making a vow, prepare yourself; <br>
  and do not be like a man who tempts the Lord.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Think of his wrath on the day of death, <br>
  and of the moment of vengeance when he turns away his face.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> In the time of plenty think of the time of hunger; <br>
  in the days of wealth think of poverty and need.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> From morning to evening conditions change, <br>
  and all things move swiftly before the Lord.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> A wise man is cautious in everything, <br>
  and in days of sin he guards against wrongdoing.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> Every intelligent man knows wisdom, <br>
  and he praises the one who finds her.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> Those who understand sayings become skilled themselves, <br>
  and pour forth apt proverbs.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> Do not follow your base desires, <br>
  but restrain your appetites.<br>
  <sup>31</sup> If you allow your soul to take pleasure in base desire, <br>
  it will make you the laughingstock of your enemies.<br>
  <sup>32</sup> Do not revel in great luxury, <br>
  lest you become impoverished by its expense.<br>
  <sup>33</sup> Do not become a beggar by feasting with borrowed money, <br>
  when you have nothing in your purse. </p><br><br>

  <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> A workman who is a drunkard will not become rich; <br>
  he who despises small things will fail little by little.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Wine and women lead intelligent men astray, <br>
  and the man who consorts with harlots is very reckless.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Decay and worms will inherit him, <br>
  and the reckless soul will be snatched away.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> One who trusts others too quickly is lightminded, <br>
  and one who sins does wrong to himself.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> One who rejoices in wickedness will be condemned,<br>
  <sup>6</sup> and for one who hates gossip evil is lessened.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Never repeat a conversation, <br>
  and you will lose nothing at all.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> With friend or foe do not report it, <br>
  and unless it would be a sin for you, do not disclose it;<br>
  <sup>9</sup> for some one has heard you and watched you, <br>
  and when the time comes he will hate you.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Have you heard a word? Let it die with you. <br>
  Be brave! It will not make you burst!<br>
  <sup>11</sup> With such a word a fool will suffer pangs <br>
  like a woman in labor with a child.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Like an arrow stuck in the flesh of the thigh, <br>
  so is a word inside a fool.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Question a friend, perhaps he did not do it; <br>
  but if he did anything, so that he may do it no more.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Question a neighbor, perhaps he did not say it; <br>
  but if he said it, so that he may not say it again.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Question a friend, for often it is slander; <br>
  so do not believe everything you hear.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> A person may make a slip without intending it. <br>
  Who has never sinned with his tongue?<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Question your neighbor before you threaten him; <br>
  and let the law of the Most High take its course.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> All wisdom is the fear of the Lord, <br>
  and in all wisdom there is the fulfilment of the law.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> But the knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom, <br>
  nor is there prudence where sinners take counsel.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> There is a cleverness which is abominable, <br>
  but there is a fool who merely lacks wisdom.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Better is the God-fearing man who lacks intelligence, <br>
  than the highly prudent man who transgresses the law.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> There is a cleverness which is scrupulous but unjust, <br>
  and there are people who distort kindness to gain a verdict.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> There is a rascal bowed down in mourning, <br>
  but inwardly he is full of deceit.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> He hides his face and pretends not to hear; <br>
  but where no one notices, he will forestall you.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> And if by lack of strength he is prevented from sinning, <br>
  he will do evil when he finds an opportunity.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> A man is known by his appearance, <br>
  and a sensible man is known by his face, when you meet him.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> A man's attire and open-mouthed laughter, <br>
  and a man's manner of walking, show what he is. </p><br><br>

  <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> There is a reproof which is not timely;<br>
  and there is a man who keeps silent but is wise.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> How much better it is to reprove than to stay angry!<br>
  And the one who confesses his fault will be kept from loss.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Like a eunuch's desire to violate a maiden<br>
  is a man who executes judgments by violence.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> There is one who by keeping silent is found wise,<br>
  while another is detested for being too talkative.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> There is one who keeps silent because he has no answer,<br>
  while another keeps silent because he knows when to speak.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> A wise man will be silent until the right moment,<br>
  but a braggart and fool goes beyond the right moment.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Whoever uses too many words will be loathed,<br>
  and whoever usurps the right to speak will be hated.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> There may be good fortune for a man in adversity,<br>
  and a windfall may result in a loss.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> There is a gift that profits you nothing,<br>
  and there is a gift that brings a double return.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> There are losses because of glory,<br>
  and there are men who have raised their heads<br>
  from humble circumstances.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> There is a man who buys much for a little,<br>
  but pays for it seven times over.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> The wise man makes himself beloved through his words,<br>
  but the courtesies of fools are wasted.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> A fool's gift will profit you nothing,<br>
  for he has many eyes instead of one.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> He gives little and upbraids much,<br>
  he opens his mouth like a herald;<br>
  today he lends and tomorrow he asks it back;<br>
  such a one is a hateful man.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> A fool will say, "I have no friend,<br>
  and there is no gratitude for my good deeds;<br>
  those who eat my bread speak unkindly."<br>
  <sup>17</sup> How many will ridicule him, and how often!<br>
  <sup>18</sup> A slip on the pavement is better than a slip of the tongue;<br>
  so the downfall of the wicked will occur speedily.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> An ungracious man is like a story told at the wrong time,<br>
  which is continually on the lips of the ignorant.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> A proverb from a fool's lips will be rejected,<br>
  for he does not tell it at its proper time.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> A man may be prevented from sinning by his poverty,<br>
  so when he rests he feels no remorse.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> A man may lose his life through shame,<br>
  or lose it because of his foolish look.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> A man may for shame make promises to a friend,<br>
  and needlessly make him an enemy.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> A lie is an ugly blot on a man;<br>
  it is continually on the lips of the ignorant.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> A thief is preferable to a habitual liar,<br>
  but the lot of both is ruin.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> The disposition of a liar brings disgrace,<br>
  and his shame is ever with him.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> He who speaks wisely will advance himself,<br>
  and a sensible man will please great men.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> Whoever cultivates the soil will heap up his harvest,<br>
  and whoever pleases great men will atone for injustice.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise;<br>
  like a muzzle on the mouth they avert reproofs.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> Hidden wisdom and unseen treasure,<br>
  what advantage is there in either of them?<br>
  <sup>31</sup> Better is the man who hides his folly<br>
  than the man who hides his wisdom. </p><br>

  <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Have you sinned, my son? Do so no more,<br>
  but pray about your former sins.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Flee from sin as from a snake;<br>
  for if you approach sin, it will bite you.<br>
  Its teeth are lion's teeth,<br>
  and destroy the souls of men.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> All lawlessness is like a two-edged sword;<br>
  there is no healing for its wound.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Terror and violence will lay waste riches;<br>
  thus the house of the proud will be laid waste.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> The prayer of a poor man goes from his lips to the ears of God,<br>
  and his judgment comes speedily.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Whoever hates reproof walks in the steps of the sinner,<br>
  but he that fears the Lord will repent in his heart.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> He who is mighty in speech is known from afar;<br>
  but the sensible man, when he slips, is aware of it.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> A man who builds his house with other people's money<br>
  is like one who gathers stones for his burial mound.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> An assembly of the wicked is like tow gathered together,<br>
  and their end is a flame of fire.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> The way of sinners is smoothly paved with stones,<br>
  but at its end is the pit of Hades.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Whoever keeps the law controls his thoughts,<br>
  and wisdom is the fulfilment of the fear of the Lord.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> He who is not clever cannot be taught,<br>
  but there is a cleverness which increases bitterness.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> The knowledge of a wise man will increase like a flood,<br>
  and his counsel like a flowing spring.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> The mind of a fool is like a broken jar;<br>
  it will hold no knowledge.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> When a man of understanding hears a wise saying,<br>
  he will praise it and add to it;<br>
  when a reveler hears it, he dislikes it<br>
  and casts it behind his back.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> A fool's narration is like a burden on a journey,<br>
  but delight will be found in the speech of the intelligent.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> The utterance of a sensible man will be sought in the assembly,<br>
  and they will ponder his words in their minds.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Like a house that has vanished, so is wisdom to a fool;<br>
  and the knowledge of the ignorant is unexamined talk.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> To a senseless man education is fetters on his feet,<br>
  and like manacles on his right hand.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> A fool raises his voice when he laughs,<br>
  but a clever man smiles quietly.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> To a sensible man education is like a golden ornament,<br>
  and like a bracelet on the right arm.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> The foot of a fool rushes into a house,<br>
  but a man of experience stands respectfully before it.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> A boor peers into the house from the door,<br>
  but a cultivated man remains outside.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> It is ill-mannered for a man to listen at a door,<br>
  and a discreet man is grieved by the disgrace.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> The lips of strangers will speak of these things,<br>
  but the words of the prudent will be weighed in the balance.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> The mind of fools is in their mouth,<br>
  but the mouth of wise men is in their mind.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> When an ungodly man curses his adversary,<br>
  he curses his own soul.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> A whisperer defiles his own soul<br>
  and is hated in his neighborhood. </p><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> The indolent may be compared to a filthy stone,<br>
  and every one hisses at his disgrace.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> The indolent may be compared to the filth of dunghills;<br>
  any one that picks it up will shake it off his hand.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> It is a disgrace to be the father of an undisciplined son,<br>
  and the birth of a daughter is a loss.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> A sensible daughter obtains her husband,<br>
  but one who acts shamefully brings grief to her father.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> An impudent daughter disgraces father and husband,<br>
  and will be despised by both.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Like music in mourning is a tale told at the wrong time,<br>
  but chastising and discipline are wisdom at all times.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> He who teaches a fool is like one who glues potsherds together,<br>
  <sup>8</sup>or who rouses a sleeper from deep slumber.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> He who tells a story to a fool tells it to a drowsy man;<br>
  <sup>10</sup>and at the end he will say, "What is it?"<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Weep for the dead, for he lacks the light;<br>
  and weep for the fool, for he lacks intelligence;<br>
  weep less bitterly for the dead, for he has attained rest;<br>
  but the life of the fool is worse than death.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Mourning for the dead lasts seven days,<br>
  but for a fool or an ungodly man it lasts all his life.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Do not talk much with a foolish man,<br>
  and do not visit an unintelligent man;<br>
  guard yourself from him to escape trouble,<br>
  and you will not be soiled when he shakes himself off;<br>
  avoid him and you will find rest,<br>
  and you will never be wearied by his madness.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> What is heavier than lead?<br>
  And what is its name except "Fool"?<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Sand, salt, and a piece of iron<br>
  are easier to bear than a stupid man.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> A wooden beam firmly bonded into a building<br>
  will not be torn loose by an earthquake;<br>
  so the mind firmly fixed on a reasonable counsel<br>
  will not be afraid in a crisis.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> A mind settled on an intelligent thought<br>
  is like the stucco decoration on the wall of a colonnade.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Fences set on a high place<br>
  will not stand firm against the wind;<br>
  so a timid heart with a fool's purpose<br>
  will not stand firm against any fear.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> A man who pricks an eye will make tears fall,<br>
  and one who pricks the heart makes it show feeling.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> One who throws a stone at birds scares them away,<br>
  and one who reviles a friend will break off the friendship.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> Even if you have drawn your sword against a friend,<br>
  do not despair, for a renewal of friendship is possible.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> If you have opened your mouth against your friend,<br>
  do not worry, for reconciliation is possible;<br>
  but as for reviling, arrogance, disclosure<br>
  of secrets, or a treacherous blow --<br>
  in these cases any friend will flee.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Gain the trust of your neighbor in his poverty,<br>
  that you may rejoice with him in his prosperity;<br>
  stand by him in time of affliction,<br>
  that you may share with him in his inheritance.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> The vapor and smoke of the furnace precede the fire;<br>
  so insults precede bloodshed.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> I will not be ashamed to protect a friend,<br>
  and I will not hide from him;<br>
  <sup>26</sup> but if some harm should happen to me because of him,<br>
  whoever hears of it will beware of him.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> O that a guard were set over my mouth,<br>
  and a seal of prudence upon my lips,<br>
  that it may keep me from falling,<br>
  so that my tongue may not destroy me! </p><br>

  <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> O Lord, Father and Ruler of my life, <br>
  do not abandon me to their counsel, <br>
  and let me not fall because of them!<br>
  <sup>2</sup> O that whips were set over my thoughts, <br>
  and the discipline of wisdom over my mind! <br>
  That they may not spare me in my errors, <br>
  and that it may not pass by my sins;<br>
  <sup>3</sup> in order that my mistakes may not be multiplied, <br>
  and my sins may not abound; <br>
  then I will not fall before my adversaries, <br>
  and my enemy will not rejoice over me.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> O Lord, Father and God of my life, <br>
  do not give me haughty eyes,<br>
  <sup>5</sup> and remove from me evil desire.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Let neither gluttony nor lust overcome me, <br>
  and do not surrender me to a shameless soul.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Listen, my children, to instruction concerning speech; <br>
  the one who observes it will never be caught.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> The sinner is overtaken through his lips, <br>
  the reviler and the arrogant are tripped by them.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Do not accustom your mouth to oaths, <br>
  and do not habitually utter the name of the Holy One;<br>
  <sup>10</sup> for as a servant who is continually examined under torture <br>
  will not lack bruises, <br>
  so also the man who always swears and utters the Name <br>
  will not be cleansed from sin.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> A man who swears many oaths will be filled with iniquity, <br>
  and the scourge will not leave his house; <br>
  if he offends, his sin remains on him, <br>
  and if he disregards it, he sins doubly; <br>
  if he has sworn needlessly, he will not be justified, <br>
  for his house will be filled with calamities.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> There is an utterance which is comparable to death; <br>
  may it never be found in the inheritance of Jacob! <br>
  For all these errors will be far from the godly, <br>
  and they will not wallow in sins.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Do not accustom your mouth to lewd vulgarity, <br>
  for it involves sinful speech.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Remember your father and mother <br>
  when you sit among great men; <br>
  lest you be forgetful in their presence, <br>
  and be deemed a fool on account of your habits; <br>
  then you will wish that you had never been born, <br>
  and you will curse the day of your birth.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> A man accustomed to use insulting words <br>
  will never become disciplined all his days.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Two sorts of men multiply sins, <br>
  and a third incurs wrath. <br>
  The soul heated like a burning fire <br>
  will not be quenched until it is consumed; <br>
  a man who commits fornication with his near of kin <br>
  will never cease until the fire burns him up.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> To a fornicator all bread tastes sweet; <br>
  he will never cease until he dies.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> A man who breaks his marriage vows<br>
  says to himself, "Who sees me? <br>
  Darkness surrounds me, and the walls hide me, <br>
  and no one sees me. Why should I fear? <br>
  The Most High will not take notice of my sins."<br>
  <sup>19</sup> His fear is confined to the eyes of men, <br>
  and he does not realize that the eyes of the Lord <br>
  are ten thousand times brighter than the sun; <br>
  they look upon all the ways of men, <br>
  and perceive even the hidden places.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Before the universe was created, it was known to him; <br>
  so it was also after it was finished.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> This man will be punished in the streets of the city, <br>
  and where he least suspects it, he will be seized.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> So it is with a woman who leaves her husband <br>
  and provides an heir by a stranger.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> For first of all, she has disobeyed the law of the Most High; <br>
  second, she has committed an offense against her husband; <br>
  and third, she has committed adultery through harlotry <br>
  and brought forth children by another man.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> She herself will be brought before the assembly, <br>
  and punishment will fall on her children.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> Her children will not take root, <br>
  and her branches will not bear fruit.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> She will leave her memory for a curse, <br>
  and her disgrace will not be blotted out.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> Those who survive her will recognize <br>
  that nothing is better than the fear of the Lord, <br>
  and nothing sweeter than to heed the commandments of the Lord. </p><br><br>

  <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Wisdom will praise herself, <br>
  and will glory in the midst of her people.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> In the assembly of the Most High she will open her mouth, <br>
  and in the presence of his host she will glory:<br>
  <sup>3</sup> "I came forth from the mouth of the Most High, <br>
  and covered the earth like a mist.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> I dwelt in high places, <br>
  and my throne was in a pillar of cloud.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Alone I have made the circuit of the vault of heaven <br>
  and have walked in the depths of the abyss.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> In the waves of the sea, in the whole earth, <br>
  and in every people and nation I have gotten a possession.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Among all these I sought a resting place; <br>
  I sought in whose territory I might lodge.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> "Then the Creator of all things gave me a commandment, <br>
  and the one who created me assigned a place for my tent. <br>
  And he said, `Make your dwelling in Jacob, <br>
  and in Israel receive your inheritance.'<br>
  <sup>9</sup> From eternity, in the beginning, he created me, <br>
  and for eternity I shall not cease to exist.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> In the holy tabernacle I ministered before him, <br>
  and so I was established in Zion.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> In the beloved city likewise he gave me a resting place, <br>
  and in Jerusalem was my dominion.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> So I took root in an honored people, <br>
  in the portion of the Lord, who is their inheritance.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> "I grew tall like a cedar in Lebanon, <br>
  and like a cypress on the heights of Hermon.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> I grew tall like a palm tree in En-ge'di, <br>
  and like rose plants in Jericho; <br>
  like a beautiful olive tree in the field, <br>
  and like a plane tree I grew tall.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Like cassia and camel's thorn I gave forth the aroma of spices, <br>
  and like choice myrrh I spread a pleasant odor, <br>
  like galbanum, onycha, and stacte, <br>
  and like the fragrance of frankincense in the tabernacle.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Like a terebinth I spread out my branches, <br>
  and my branches are glorious and graceful.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Like a vine I caused loveliness to bud, <br>
  and my blossoms became glorious and abundant fruit.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> "Come to me, you who desire me, <br>
  and eat your fill of my produce.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> For the remembrance of me is sweeter than honey, <br>
  and my inheritance sweeter than the honeycomb.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> Those who eat me will hunger for more, <br>
  and those who drink me will thirst for more.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> Whoever obeys me will not be put to shame, <br>
  and those who work with my help will not sin."<br>
  <sup>23</sup> All this is the book of the covenant of the Most High God, <br>
  the law which Moses commanded us <br>
  as an inheritance for the congregations of Jacob.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> It fills men with wisdom, like the Pishon, <br>
  and like the Tigris at the time of the first fruits.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> It makes them full of understanding, like the Euphrates, <br>
  and like the Jordan at harvest time.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> It makes instruction shine forth like light, <br>
  like the Gihon at the time of vintage.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> Just as the first man did not know her perfectly, <br>
  the last one has not fathomed her;<br>
  <sup>29</sup> for her thought is more abundant than the sea, <br>
  and her counsel deeper than the great abyss.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> I went forth like a canal from a river <br>
  and like a water channel into a garden.<br>
  <sup>31</sup> I said, "I will water my orchard <br>
  and drench my garden plot"; <br>
  and lo, my canal became a river, <br>
  and my river became a sea.<br>
  <sup>32</sup> I will again make instruction shine forth like the dawn, <br>
  and I will make it shine afar;<br>
  <sup>33</sup> I will again pour out teaching like prophecy, <br>
  and leave it to all future generations.<br>
  <sup>34</sup> Observe that I have not labored for myself alone, <br>
  but for all who seek instruction. </p><br><br>

  <h2>Chapter 25</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> My soul takes pleasure in three things,<br>
  and they are beautiful in the sight of the Lord and of men;<br>
  agreement between brothers, friendship between neighbors,<br>
  and a wife and a husband who live in harmony.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> My soul hates three kinds of men,<br>
  and I am greatly offended at their life:<br>
  a beggar who is proud, a rich man who is a liar,<br>
  and an adulterous old man who lacks good sense.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> You have gathered nothing in your youth;<br>
  how then can you find anything in your old age?<br>
  <sup>4</sup> What an attractive thing is judgment in gray-haired men,<br>
  and for the aged to possess good counsel!<br>
  <sup>5</sup> How attractive is wisdom in the aged,<br>
  and understanding and counsel in honorable men!<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Rich experience is the crown of the aged,<br>
  and their boast is the fear of the Lord.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> With nine thoughts I have gladdened my heart,<br>
  and a tenth I shall tell with my tongue:<br>
  a man rejoicing in his children;<br>
  a man who lives to see the downfall of his foes;<br>
  <sup>8</sup> happy is he who lives with an intelligent wife,<br>
  and he who has not made a slip with his tongue,<br>
  and he who has not served a man inferior to himself;<br>
  <sup>9</sup> happy is he who has gained good sense,<br>
  and he who speaks to attentive listeners.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> How great is he who has gained wisdom!<br>
  But there is no one superior to him who fears the Lord.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> The fear of the Lord surpasses everything;<br>
  to whom shall be likened the one who holds it fast?<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Any wound, but not a wound of the heart!<br>
  Any wickedness, but not the wickedness of a wife!<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Any attack, but not an attack from those who hate!<br>
  And any vengeance, but not the vengeance of enemies!<br>
  <sup>15</sup> There is no venom worse than a snake's venom,<br>
  and no wrath worse than an enemy's wrath.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> I would rather dwell with a lion and a dragon<br>
  than dwell with an evil wife.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> The wickedness of a wife changes her appearance,<br>
  and darkens her face like that of a bear.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Her husband takes his meals among the neighbors,<br>
  and he cannot help sighing bitterly.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Any iniquity is insignificant compared to a wife's iniquity;<br>
  may a sinner's lot befall her!<br>
  <sup>20</sup> A sandy ascent for the feet of the aged --<br>
  such is a garrulous wife for a quiet husband.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> Do not be ensnared by a woman's beauty,<br>
  and do not desire a woman for her possessions.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> There is wrath and impudence and great disgrace<br>
  when a wife supports her husband.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> A dejected mind, a gloomy face,<br>
  and a wounded heart are caused by an evil wife.<br>
  Drooping hands and weak knees<br>
  are caused by the wife who does not make her husband happy.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> From a woman sin had its beginning,<br>
  and because of her we all die.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> Allow no outlet to water,<br>
  and no boldness of speech in an evil wife.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> If she does not go as you direct,<br>
  separate her from yourself. </p><br>

  <h2>Chapter 26</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Happy is the husband of a good wife; <br>
  the number of his days will be doubled.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> A loyal wife rejoices her husband, <br>
  and he will complete his years in peace.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> A good wife is a great blessing; <br>
  she will be granted among the blessings of <br>
  the man who fears the Lord.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Whether rich or poor, his heart is glad, <br>
  and at all times his face is cheerful.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Of three things my heart is afraid, <br>
  and of a fourth I am frightened: <br>
  The slander of a city, the gathering of a mob, <br>
  and false accusation -- all these are worse than death.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> There is grief of heart and sorrow <br>
  when a wife is envious of a rival, and a tongue-lashing <br>
  makes it known to all.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> An evil wife is an ox yoke which chafes; <br>
  taking hold of her is like grasping a scorpion.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> There is great anger when a wife is drunken; <br>
  she will not hide her shame.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> A wife's harlotry shows in her lustful eyes, <br>
  and she is known by her eyelids.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Keep strict watch over a headstrong daughter, <br>
  lest, when she finds liberty, she use it to her hurt.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Be on guard against her impudent eye, <br>
  and do not wonder if she sins against you.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> As a thirsty wayfarer opens his mouth <br>
  and drinks from any water near him, <br>
  so will she sit in front of every post <br>
  and open her quiver to the arrow.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> A wife's charm delights her husband, <br>
  and her skill puts fat on his bones.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> A silent wife is a gift of the Lord, <br>
  and there is nothing so precious as a disciplined soul.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> A modest wife adds charm to charm,  <br>
  and no balance can weigh the value of a chaste soul.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Like the sun rising in the heights of the Lord, <br>
  so is the beauty of a good wife in her well-ordered home.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Like the shining lamp on the holy lampstand, <br>
  so is a beautiful face on a stately figure.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Like pillars of gold on a base of silver, <br>
  so are beautiful feet with a steadfast heart.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> At two things my heart is grieved, <br>
  and because of a third anger comes over me: <br>
  a warrior in want through poverty, <br>
  and intelligent men who are treated contemptuously; <br>
  a man who turns back from righteousness to sin -- <br>
  the Lord will prepare him for the sword!<br>
  <sup>29</sup> A merchant can hardly keep from wrongdoing, <br>
  and a tradesman will not be declared innocent of sin. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 27</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Many have committed sin for a trifle, <br>
  and whoever seeks to get rich will avert his eyes.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> As a stake is driven firmly into a fissure between stones, <br>
  so sin is wedged in between selling and buying.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> If a man is not steadfast and zealous in the fear of the Lord, <br>
  his house will be quickly overthrown.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> When a sieve is shaken, the refuse remains; <br>
  so a man's filth remains in his thoughts.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> The kiln tests the potter's vessels; <br>
  so the test of a man is in his reasoning.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> The fruit discloses the cultivation of a tree; <br>
  so the expression of a thought discloses the <br>
  cultivation of a man's mind.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Do not praise a man before you hear him reason, <br>
  for this is the test of men.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> If you pursue justice, you will attain it <br>
  and wear it as a glorious robe.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Birds flock with their kind; <br>
  so truth returns to those who practice it.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> A lion lies in wait for prey; <br>
  so does sin for the workers of iniquity.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> The talk of the godly man is always wise, <br>
  but the fool changes like the moon.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Among stupid people watch for a chance to leave, <br>
  but among thoughtful people stay on.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> The talk of fools is offensive, <br>
  and their laughter is wantonly sinful.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> The talk of men given to swearing makes one's <br>
  hair stand on end, <br>
  and their quarrels make a man stop his ears.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> The strife of the proud leads to bloodshed, <br>
  and their abuse is grievous to hear.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Whoever betrays secrets destroys confidence, <br>
  and he will never find a congenial friend.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Love your friend and keep faith with him; <br>
  but if you betray his secrets, do not run after him.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> For as a man destroys his enemy, <br>
  so you have destroyed the friendship of your neighbor.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> And as you allow a bird to escape from your hand, <br>
  so you have let your neighbor go, and will <br>
  not catch him again.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Do not go after him, for he is too far off, <br>
  and has escaped like a gazelle from a snare.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> For a wound may be bandaged, <br>
  and there is reconciliation after abuse, <br>
  but whoever has betrayed secrets is without hope.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> Whoever winks his eye plans evil deeds, <br>
  and no one can keep him from them.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> In your presence his mouth is all sweetness, <br>
  and he admires your words; <br>
  but later he will twist his speech <br>
  and with your own words he will give offense.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> I have hated many things, but none to be compared to him; <br>
  even the Lord will hate him.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> Whoever throws a stone straight up throws it on his own head; <br>
  and a treacherous blow opens up wounds.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> He who digs a pit will fall into it, <br>
  and he who sets a snare will be caught in it.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> If a man does evil, it will roll back upon him, <br>
  and he will not know where it came from.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> Mockery and abuse issue from the proud man, <br>
  but vengeance lies in wait for him like a lion.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> Those who rejoice in the fall of the godly <br>
  will be caught in a snare, <br>
  and pain will consume them before their death.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> Anger and wrath, these also are abominations, <br>
  and the sinful man will possess them. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 28</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> He that takes vengeance will suffer vengeance from the Lord, <br>
  and he will firmly establish his sins.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Forgive your neighbor the wrong he has done, <br>
  and then your sins will be pardoned when you pray.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Does a man harbor anger against another, <br>
  and yet seek for healing from the Lord?<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Does he have no mercy toward a man like himself, <br>
  and yet pray for his own sins?<br>
  <sup>5</sup> If he himself, being flesh, maintains wrath, <br>
  who will make expiation for his sins?<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Remember the end of your life, and cease from enmity, <br>
  remember destruction and death, and be true <br>
  to the commandments.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Remember the commandments, and do not be angry <br>
  with your neighbor; <br>
  remember the covenant of the Most High, and <br>
  overlook ignorance.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Refrain from strife, and you will lessen sins; <br>
  for a man given to anger will kindle strife,<br>
  <sup>9</sup> and a sinful man will disturb friends <br>
  and inject enmity among those who are at peace.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> In proportion to the fuel for the fire, so will be the burning, <br>
  and in proportion to the obstinacy of strife <br>
  will be the burning; <br>
  in proportion to the strength of the man will be his anger, <br>
  and in proportion to his wealth he will heighten his wrath.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> A hasty quarrel kindles fire, <br>
  and urgent strife sheds blood.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> If you blow on a spark, it will glow; <br>
  if you spit on it, it will be put out; <br>
  and both come out of your mouth.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Curse the whisperer and deceiver, <br>
  for he has destroyed many who were at peace.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Slander has shaken many, <br>
  and scattered them from nation to nation, <br>
  and destroyed strong cities, <br>
  and overturned the houses of great men.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Slander has driven away courageous women, <br>
  and deprived them of the fruit of their toil.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Whoever pays heed to slander will not find rest, <br>
  nor will he settle down in peace.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> The blow of a whip raises a welt, <br>
  but a blow of the tongue crushes the bones.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, <br>
  but not so many as have fallen because of the tongue.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Happy is the man who is protected from it, <br>
  who has not been exposed to its anger, <br>
  who has not borne its yoke, <br>
  and has not been bound with its fetters;<br>
  <sup>20</sup> for its yoke is a yoke of iron, <br>
  and its fetters are fetters of bronze;<br>
  <sup>21</sup> its death is an evil death, <br>
  and Hades is preferable to it.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> It will not be master over the godly, <br>
  and they will not be burned in its flame.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Those who forsake the Lord will fall into its power; <br>
  it will burn among them and will not be put out. <br>
  It will be sent out against them like a lion; <br>
  like a leopard it will mangle them.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> See that you fence in your property with thorns, <br>
  lock up your silver and gold,<br>
  <sup>25</sup> make balances and scales for your words, <br>
  and make a door and a bolt for your mouth.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> Beware lest you err with your tongue, <br>
  lest you fall before him who lies in wait. </p><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 29</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> He that shows mercy will lend to his neighbor, <br>
  and he that strengthens him with his hand <br>
  keeps the commandments.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Lend to your neighbor in the time of his need; <br>
  and in turn, repay your neighbor promptly.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Confirm your word and keep faith with him, <br>
  and on every occasion you will find what you need.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Many persons regard a loan as a windfall, <br>
  and cause trouble to those who help them.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> A man will kiss another's hands until he gets a loan, <br>
  and will lower his voice in speaking of his neighbor's money; <br>
  but at the time for repayment he will delay, <br>
  and will pay in words of unconcern, <br>
  and will find fault with the time.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> If the lender exert pressure, he will hardly get back half, <br>
  and will regard that as a windfall. <br>
  If he does not, the borrower has robbed him of his money, <br>
  and he has needlessly made him his enemy; <br>
  he will repay him with curses and reproaches, <br>
  and instead of glory will repay him with dishonor.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Because of such wickedness, therefore, many <br>
  have refused to lend; <br>
  they have been afraid of being defrauded needlessly.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Nevertheless, be patient with a man in humble circumstances, <br>
  and do not make him wait for your alms.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Help a poor man for the commandment's sake, <br>
  and because of his need do not send him away empty.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Lose your silver for the sake of a brother or a friend, <br>
  and do not let it rust under a stone and be lost.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Lay up your treasure according to the commandments <br>
  of the Most High, <br>
  and it will profit you more than gold.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Store up almsgiving in your treasury, <br>
  and it will rescue you from all affliction;<br>
  <sup>13</sup> more than a mighty shield and more than a heavy spear, <br>
  it will fight on your behalf against your enemy.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> A good man will be surety for his neighbor, <br>
  but a man who has lost his sense of shame will fail him.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Do not forget all the kindness of your surety, <br>
  for he has given his life for you.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> A sinner will overthrow the prosperity of his surety,<br>
  <sup>17</sup> and one who does not feel grateful will abandon his rescuer.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Being surety has ruined many men who were prosperous, <br>
  and has shaken them like a wave of the sea; <br>
  it has driven men of power into exile, <br>
  and they have wandered among foreign nations.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> The sinner who has fallen into suretyship <br>
  and pursues gain will fall into lawsuits.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Assist your neighbor according to your ability, <br>
  but take heed to yourself lest you fall.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> The essentials for life are water and bread <br>
  and clothing and a house to cover one's nakedness.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> Better is the life of a poor man under the shelter of his roof<br>
  than sumptuous food in another man's house.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Be content with little or much.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> It is a miserable life to go from house to house, <br>
  and where you are a stranger you may not open your mouth;<br>
  <sup>25</sup> you will play the host and provide drink without being thanked, <br>
  and besides this you will hear bitter words:<br>
  <sup>26</sup> "Come here, stranger, prepare the table, <br>
  and if you have anything at hand, let me have it to eat."<br>
  <sup>27</sup> "Give place, stranger, to an honored person; <br>
  my brother has come to stay with me; I need my house."<br>
  <sup>28</sup> These things are hard to bear for a man who has feeling: <br>
  scolding about lodging and the reproach of the moneylender. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 30</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> He who loves his son will whip him often, <br>
  in order that he may rejoice at the way he turns out.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> He who disciplines his son will profit by him, <br>
  and will boast of him among acquaintances.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> He who teaches his son will make his enemies envious, <br>
  and will glory in him in the presence of friends.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> The father may die, and yet he is not dead, <br>
  for he has left behind him one like himself;<br>
  <sup>5</sup> while alive he saw and rejoiced, <br>
  and when he died he was not grieved;<br>
  <sup>6</sup> he has left behind him an avenger against his enemies, <br>
  and one to repay the kindness of his friends.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> He who spoils his son will bind up his wounds, <br>
  and his feelings will be troubled at every cry.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> A horse that is untamed turns out to be stubborn, <br>
  and a son unrestrained turns out to be wilful.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Pamper a child, and he will frighten you; <br>
  play with him, and he will give you grief.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Do not laugh with him, lest you have sorrow with him, <br>
  and in the end you will gnash your teeth.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Give him no authority in his youth, <br>
  and do not ignore his errors.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Bow down his neck in his youth, <br>
  and beat his sides while he is young, <br>
  lest he become stubborn and disobey you, <br>
  and you have sorrow of soul from him.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Discipline your son and take pains with him, <br>
  that you may not be offended by his shamelessness.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Better off is a poor man who is well and strong in constitution <br>
  than a rich man who is severely afflicted in body.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Health and soundness are better than all gold, <br>
  and a robust body than countless riches.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> There is no wealth better than health of body, <br>
  and there is no gladness above joy of heart.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Death is better than a miserable life, <br>
  and eternal rest than chronic sickness.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Good things poured out upon a mouth that is closed <br>
  are like offerings of food placed upon a grave.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Of what use to an idol is an offering of fruit? <br>
  For it can neither eat nor smell. <br>
  So is he who is afflicted by the Lord;<br>
  <sup>20</sup> he sees with his eyes and groans, <br>
  like a eunuch who embraces a maiden and groans.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> Do not give yourself over to sorrow, <br>
  and do not afflict yourself deliberately.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> Gladness of heart is the life of man, <br>
  and the rejoicing of a man is length of days.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Delight your soul and comfort your heart, <br>
  and remove sorrow far from you, <br>
  for sorrow has destroyed many, and there is no profit in it.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Jealousy and anger shorten life, <br>
  and anxiety brings on old age too soon.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> A man of cheerful and good heart <br>
  will give heed to the food he eats. </p><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 31</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Wakefulness over wealth wastes away one's flesh, <br>
  and anxiety about it removes sleep.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Wakeful anxiety prevents slumber, <br>
  and a severe illness carries off sleep.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> The rich man toils as his wealth accumulates, <br>
  and when he rests he fills himself with his dainties.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> The poor man toils as his livelihood diminishes, <br>
  and when he rests he becomes needy.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> He who loves gold will not be justified,<br>
  and he who pursues money will be led astray by it.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Many have come to ruin because of gold, <br>
  and their destruction has met them face to face.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> It is a stumbling block to those who are devoted to it, <br>
  and every fool will be taken captive by it.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Blessed is the rich man who is found blameless, <br>
  and who does not go after gold.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Who is he? And we will call him blessed, <br>
  for he has done wonderful things among his people.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Who has been tested by it and been found perfect? <br>
  Let it be for him a ground for boasting. <br>
  Who has had the power to transgress and did not transgress, <br>
  and to do evil and did not do it?<br>
  <sup>11</sup> His prosperity will be established, <br>
  and the assembly will relate his acts of charity.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Are you seated at the table of a great man? <br>
  Do not be greedy at it, <br>
  and do not say, "There is certainly much upon it!"<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Remember that a greedy eye is a bad thing. <br>
  What has been created more greedy than the eye? <br>
  Therefore it sheds tears from every face.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Do not reach out your hand for everything you see, <br>
  and do not crowd your neighbor at the dish.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Judge your neighbor's feelings by your own, <br>
  and in every matter be thoughtful.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Eat like a human being what is set before you, <br>
  and do not chew greedily, lest you be hated.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Be the first to stop eating, for the sake of good manners, <br>
  and do not be insatiable, lest you give offense.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> If you are seated among many persons, <br>
  do not reach out your hand before they do.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> How ample a little is for a well-disciplined man! <br>
  He does not breathe heavily upon his bed.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Healthy sleep depends on moderate eating; <br>
  he rises early, and feels fit. <br>
  The distress of sleeplessness and of nausea <br>
  and colic are with the glutton.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> If you are overstuffed with food, <br>
  get up in the middle of the meal, and you will have relief.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> Listen to me, my son, and do not disregard me, <br>
  and in the end you will appreciate my words. <br>
  In all your work be industrious, <br>
  and no sickness will overtake you.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Men will praise the one who is liberal with food, <br>
  and their testimony to his excellence is trustworthy.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> The city will complain of the one who is niggardly with food, <br>
  and their testimony to his niggardliness is accurate.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> Do not aim to be valiant over wine,<br>
  for wine has destroyed many.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> Fire and water prove the temper of steel, <br>
  so wine tests hearts in the strife of the proud.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> Wine is like life to men, <br>
  if you drink it in moderation. <br>
  What is life to a man who is without wine? <br>
  It has been created to make men glad.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> Wine drunk in season and temperately <br>
  is rejoicing of heart and gladness of soul.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> Wine drunk to excess is bitterness of soul, <br>
  with provocation and stumbling.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> Drunkenness increases the anger of a fool to his injury, <br>
  reducing his strength and adding wounds.<br>
  <sup>31</sup> Do not reprove your neighbor at a banquet of wine, <br>
  and do not despise him in his merrymaking; <br>
  speak no word of reproach to him, <br>
  and do not afflict him by making demands of him. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 32</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> If they make you master of the feast, do not exalt yourself; <br>
  be among them as one of them; <br>
  take good care of them and then be seated;<br>
  <sup>2</sup> when you have fulfilled your duties, take your place, <br>
  that you may be merry on their account <br>
  and receive a wreath for your excellent leadership.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Speak, you who are older, for it is fitting that you should, <br>
  but with accurate knowledge, and do not interrupt the music.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Where there is entertainment, do not pour out talk; <br>
  do not display your cleverness out of season.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> A ruby seal in a setting of gold <br>
  is a concert of music at a banquet of wine.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> A seal of emerald in a rich setting of gold <br> 
  is the melody of music with good wine.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Speak, young man, if there is need of you, <br>
  but no more than twice, and only if asked.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Speak concisely, say much in few words; <br>
  be as one who knows and yet holds his tongue.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Among the great do not act as their equal; <br>
  and when another is speaking, do not babble.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Lightning speeds before the thunder, <br>
  and approval precedes a modest man.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Leave in good time and do not be the last; <br>
  go home quickly and do not linger.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Amuse yourself there, and do what you have in mind, <br>
  but do not sin through proud speech.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> And for these things bless him who made you <br>
  and satisfies you with his good gifts.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> He who fears the Lord will accept his discipline, <br>
  and those who rise early to seek him will find favor.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> He who seeks the law will be filled with it, <br>
  but the hypocrite will stumble at it.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Those who fear the Lord will form true judgments, <br>
  and like a light they will kindle righteous deeds.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> A sinful man will shun reproof, <br>
  and will find a decision according to his liking.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> A man of judgment will not overlook an idea, <br>
  and an insolent and proud man will not cower in fear.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Do nothing without deliberation; <br>
  and when you have acted, do not regret it.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Do not go on a path full of hazards, <br>
  and do not stumble over stony ground.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> Do not be overconfident on a smooth way,<br>
  <sup>22</sup> and give good heed to your paths.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Guard yourself in every act, <br>
  for this is the keeping of the commandments.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> He who believes the law gives heed to the commandments, <br>
  and he who trusts the Lord will not suffer loss. </p><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 33</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> No evil will befall the man who fears the Lord,<br>
  but in trial he will deliver him again and again.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> A wise man will not hate the law,<br>
  but he who is hypocritical about it is like a boat in a storm.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> A man of understanding will trust in the law;<br>
  for him the law is as dependable as an inquiry<br>
  by means of Urim.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Prepare what to say, and thus you will be heard; <br>
  bind together your instruction, and make your answer.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> The heart of a fool is like a cart wheel,<br>
  and his thoughts like a turning axle.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> A stallion is like a mocking friend;<br>
  he neighs under every one who sits on him.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Why is any day better than another,<br>
  when all the daylight in the year is from the sun?<br>
  <sup>8</sup> By the Lord's decision they were distinguished,<br>
  and he appointed the different seasons and feasts;<br>
  <sup>9</sup> some of them he exalted and hallowed,<br>
  and some of them he made ordinary days.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> All men are from the ground,<br>
  and Adam was created of the dust.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> In the fulness of his knowledge the Lord distinguished them<br>
  and appointed their different ways;<br>
  <sup>12</sup> some of them he blessed and exalted,<br>
  and some of them he made holy and brought near to himself;<br>
  but some of them he cursed and brought low,<br>
  and he turned them out of their place.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> As clay in the hand of the potter --<br>
  for all his ways are as he pleases --<br>
  so men are in the hand of him who made them,<br>
  to give them as he decides.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Good is the opposite of evil,<br>
  and life the opposite of death;<br>
  so the sinner is the opposite of the godly.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Look upon all the works of the Most High;<br>
  they likewise are in pairs, one the opposite of the other.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> I was the last on watch;<br>
  I was like one who gleans after the grape-gatherers;<br>
  by the blessing of the Lord I excelled,<br>
  and like a grape-gatherer I filled my wine press.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Consider that I have not labored for myself alone,<br>
  but for all who seek instruction.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Hear me, you who are great among the people,<br>
  and you leaders of the congregation, hearken.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> To son or wife, to brother or friend,<br>
  do not give power over yourself, as long as you live;<br>
  and do not give your property to another,<br>
  lest you change your mind and must ask for it.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> While you are still alive and have breath in you,<br>
  do not let any one take your place.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> For it is better that your children should ask from you<br>
  than that you should look to the hand of you sons.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> Excel in all that you do;<br>
  bring no stain upon your honor.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> At the time when you end the days of your life,<br>
  in the hour of death, distribute your inheritance.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Fodder and a stick and burdens for an ass;<br>
  bread and discipline and work for a servant.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> Set your slave to work, and you will find rest;<br>
  leave his hands idle, and he will seek liberty.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> Yoke and thong will bow the neck,<br>
  and for a wicked servant there are racks and tortures.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> Put him to work, that he may not be idle,<br>
  for idleness teaches much evil.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> Set him to work, as is fitting for him,<br>
  and if he does not obey, make his fetters heavy.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> Do not act immoderately toward anybody,<br>
  and do nothing without discretion.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> If you have a servant, let him be as yourself,<br>
  because you have bought him with blood.<br>
  <sup>31</sup> If you have a servant, treat him as a brother,<br>
  for as your own soul you will need him.<br>
  If you ill-treat him, and he leaves and runs away,<br>
  which way will you go to seek him? </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 34</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> A man of no understanding has vain and false hopes,<br>
  and dreams give wings to fools.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> As one who catches at a shadow and pursues the wind,<br>
  so is he who gives heed to dreams.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> The vision of dreams is this against that,<br>
  the likeness of a face confronting a face.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> From an unclean thing what will be made clean?<br>
  And from something false what will be true?<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Divinations and omens and dreams are folly,<br>
  and like a woman in travail the mind has fancies.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Unless they are sent from the Most High as a visitation,<br>
  do not give your mind to them.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> For dreams have deceived many,<br>
  and those who put their hope in them have failed.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Without such deceptions the law will be fulfilled,<br>
  and wisdom is made perfect in truthful lips.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> An educated man knows many things,<br>
  and one with much experience will speak with understanding.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> He that is inexperienced knows few things,<br>
  but he that has traveled acquires much cleverness.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> I have seen many things in my travels,<br>
  and I understand more than I can express.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> I have often been in danger of death,<br>
  but have escaped because of these experiences.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> The spirit of those who fear the Lord will live,<br>
  for their hope is in him who saves them.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> He who fears the Lord will not be timid,<br>
  nor play the coward, for he is his hope.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Blessed is the soul of the man who fears the Lord!<br>
  To whom does he look? And who is his support?<br>
  <sup>16</sup> The eyes of the Lord are upon those who love him,<br>
  a mighty protection and strong support,<br>
  a shelter from the hot wind and a shade from noonday sun,<br>
  a guard against stumbling and a defense against falling.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> He lifts up the soul and gives light to the eyes;<br>
  he grants healing, life, and blessing.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> If one sacrifices from what has been wrongfully obtained, the<br>
  offering is blemished; the gifts of the lawless are not acceptable.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> The Most High is not pleased with the offerings of the ungodly;<br>
  and he is not propitiated for sins by a multitude<br>
  of sacrifices.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Like one who kills a son before his father's eyes<br>
  is the man who offers a sacrifice from the<br>
  property of the poor.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> The bread of the needy is the life of the poor;<br>
  whoever deprives them of it is a man of blood.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> To take away a neighbor's living is to murder him;<br>
  to deprive an employee of his wages is to shed blood.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> When one builds and another tears down,<br>
  what do they gain but toil?<br>
  <sup>24</sup> When one prays and another curses,<br>
  to whose voice will the Lord listen?<br>
  <sup>25</sup> If a man washes after touching a dead body,<br>
  and touches it again,<br>
  what has he gained by his washing?<br>
  <sup>26</sup> So if a man fasts for his sins,<br>
  and goes again and does the same things,<br>
  who will listen to his prayer?<br>
  And what has he gained by humbling himself? </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 35</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> He who keeps the law makes many offerings;<br>
  he who heeds the commandments sacrifices a peace offering.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> He who returns a kindness offers fine flour,<br>
  and he who gives alms sacrifices a thank offering.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> To keep from wickedness is pleasing to the Lord,<br>
  and to forsake unrighteousness is atonement.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Do not appear before the Lord empty-handed,<br>
  <sup>5</sup> for all these things are to be done because<br>
  of the commandment.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> The offering of a righteous man anoints the altar,<br>
  and its pleasing odor rises before the Most High.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> The sacrifice of a righteous man is acceptable,<br>
  and the memory of it will not be forgotten.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Glorify the Lord generously,<br>
  and do not stint the first fruits of your hands.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> With every gift show a cheerful face,<br>
  and dedicate your tithe with gladness.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Give to the Most High as he has given,<br>
  and as generously as your hand has found.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> For the Lord is the one who repays,<br>
  and he will repay you sevenfold.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Do not offer him a bribe, for he will not accept it;<br>
  and do not trust to an unrighteous sacrifice;<br>
  for the Lord is the judge,<br>
  and with him is no partiality.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> He will not show partiality in the case of a poor man;<br>
  and he will listen to the prayer of one who is wronged.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> He will not ignore the supplication of the fatherless,<br>
  nor the widow when she pours out her story.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Do not the tears of the widow run down her cheek<br>
  as she cries out against him who has caused them to fall?<br>
  <sup>16</sup> He whose service is pleasing to the Lord will be accepted,<br>
  and his prayer will reach to the clouds.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds,<br>
  and he will not be consoled until it reaches the Lord;<br>
  he will not desist until the Most High visits him,<br>
  and does justice for the righteous, and executes judgment.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> And the Lord will not delay,<br>
  neither will he be patient with them,<br>
  till he crushes the loins of the unmerciful<br>
  and repays vengeance on the nations;<br>
  till he takes away the multitude of the insolent,<br>
  and breaks the scepters of the unrighteous;<br>
  <sup>19</sup> till he repays the man according to his deeds,<br>
  and the works of men according to their devices;<br>
  till he judges the case of his people<br>
  and makes them rejoice in his mercy.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Mercy is as welcome when he afflicts them<br>
  as clouds of rain in the time of drought. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 36</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Have mercy upon us, O Lord, the God of all, and look upon us,<br>
  <sup>2</sup> and cause the fear of thee to fall upon all the nations.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Lift up thy hand against foreign nations<br>
  and let them see thy might.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> As in us thou hast been sanctified before them,<br>
  so in them be thou magnified before us;<br>
  <sup>5</sup> and let them know thee, as we have known<br>
  that there is not God but thee, O Lord.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Show signs anew, and work further wonders;<br>
  make thy hand and thy right arm glorious.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Rouse thy anger and pour out thy wrath;<br>
  destroy the adversary and wipe out the enemy.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Hasten the day, and remember the appointed time,<br>
  and let people recount thy mighty deeds.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Let him who survives be consumed in the fiery wrath,<br>
  and may those who harm thy people meet destruction.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Crush the heads of the rulers of the enemy,<br>
  who say, "There is no one but ourselves."<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Gather all the tribes of Jacob,<br>
  and give them their inheritance, as at the beginning.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Have mercy, O Lord, upon the people called by thy name,<br>
  upon Israel, whom thou hast likened to a first-born son.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Have pity on the city of thy sanctuary,<br>
  Jerusalem, the place of thy rest.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Fill Zion with the celebration of thy wondrous deeds,<br>
  and thy temple with thy glory.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Bear witness to those whom thou didst create in the beginning,<br>
  and fulfil the prophecies spoken in thy name.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Reward those who wait for thee,<br>
  and let thy prophets be found trustworthy.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Hearken, O Lord, to the prayer of thy servants,<br>
  according to the blessing of Aaron for thy people,<br>
  and all who are on the earth will know<br>
  that thou art the Lord, the God of the ages.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> The stomach will take any food,<br>
  yet one food is better than another.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> As the palate tastes the kinds of game,<br>
  so an intelligent mind detects false words.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> A perverse mind will cause grief,<br>
  but a man of experience will pay him back.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> A woman will accept any man,<br>
  but one daughter is better than another.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> A woman's beauty gladdens the countenance,<br>
  and surpasses every human desire.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> If kindness and humility mark her speech,<br>
  her husband is not like other men.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> He who acquires a wife gets his best possession,<br>
  a helper fit for him and a pillar of support.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> Where there is no fence, the property will be plundered;<br>
  and where there is no wife, a man will wander about and sigh.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> For who will trust a nimble robber<br>
  that skips from city to city?<br>
  So who will trust a man that has no home,<br>
  and lodges wherever night finds him? </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 37</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Every friend will say, "I too am a friend";<br>
  but some friends are friends only in name.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Is it not a grief to the death<br>
  when a companion and friend turns to enmity?<br>
  <sup>3</sup> O evil imagination, why were you formed<br>
  to cover the land with deceit?<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Some companions rejoice in the happiness of a friend,<br>
  but in time of trouble are against him.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Some companions help a friend for their stomach's sake,<br>
  and in the face of battle take up the shield.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Do not forget a friend in your heart,<br>
  and be not unmindful of him in your wealth.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Every counselor praises counsel,<br>
  but some give counsel in their own interest.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Be wary of a counselor,<br>
  and learn first what is his interest --<br>
  for he will take thought for himself --<br>
  lest he cast the lot against you<br>
  <sup>9</sup> and tell you, "Your way is good,"<br>
  and then stand aloof to see what will happen to you.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Do not consult the one who looks at you suspiciously;<br>
  hide your counsel from those who are jealous of you.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Do not consult with a woman about her rival<br>
  or with a coward about war,<br>
  with a merchant about barter<br>
  or with a buyer about selling,<br>
  with a grudging man about gratitude<br>
  or with a merciless man about kindness,<br>
  with an idler about any work<br>
  or with a man hired for a year about completing his work,<br>
  with a lazy servant about a big task --<br>
  pay no attention to these in any matter of counsel.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> But stay constantly with a godly man<br>
  whom you know to be a keeper of the commandments,<br>
  whose soul is in accord with your soul,<br>
  and who will sorrow with you if you fail.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> And establish the counsel of your own heart,<br>
  for no one is more faithful to you than it is.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> For a man's soul sometimes keeps him better informed<br>
  than seven watchmen sitting high on a watchtower.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> And besides all this pray to the Most High<br>
  that he may direct your way in truth.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Reason is the beginning of every work,<br>
  and counsel precedes every undertaking.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> As a clue to changes of heart<br>
  <sup>18</sup> four turns of fortune appear,<br>
  good and evil, life and death;<br>
  and it is the tongue that continually rules them.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> A man may be shrewd and the teacher of many,<br>
  and yet be unprofitable to himself.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> A man skilled in words may be hated;<br>
  he will be destitute of all food,<br>
  <sup>21</sup> for grace was not given him by the Lord,<br>
  since he is lacking in all wisdom.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> A man may be wise to his own advantage,<br>
  and the fruits of his understanding may be<br>
  trustworthy on his lips.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> A wise man will instruct his own people,<br>
  and the fruits of his understanding will be trustworthy.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> A wise man will have praise heaped upon him,<br>
  and all who see him will call him happy.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> The life of a man is numbered by days,<br>
  but the days of Israel are without number.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> He who is wise among his people will inherit confidence,<br>
  and his name will live for ever.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> My son, test your soul while you live;<br>
  see what is bad for it and do not give it that.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> For not everything is good for every one,<br>
  and not every person enjoys everything.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> Do not have an insatiable appetite for any luxury,<br>
  and do not give yourself up to food;<br>
  <sup>30</sup> for overeating brings sickness,<br>
  and gluttony leads to nausea.<br>
  <sup>31</sup> Many have died of gluttony,<br>
  but he who is careful to avoid it prolongs his life.</p><br><br>

  <sup>1</sup> Honor the physician with the honor due him,<br>
  according to your need of<br>
  him, for the Lord created him;<br>
  <sup>2</sup> for healing comes from the Most High,<br>
  and he will receive a gift from the king.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> The skill of the physician lifts up his head,<br>
  and in the presence of great men he is admired.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> The Lord created medicines from the earth,<br>
  and a sensible man will not despise them.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Was not water made sweet with a tree<br>
  in order that his power might be known?<br>
  <sup>6</sup> And he gave skill to men<br>
  that he might be glorified in his marvelous works.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> By them he heals and takes away pain;<br>
  <sup>8</sup> the pharmacist makes of them a compound.<br>
  His works will never be finished;<br>
  and from him health is upon the face of the earth.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> My son, when you are sick do not be negligent,<br>
  but pray to the Lord, and he will heal you.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Give up your faults and direct your hands aright,<br>
  and cleanse your heart from all sin.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Offer a sweet-smelling sacrifice, and a memorial<br>
  portion of fine flour,<br>
  and pour oil on your offering, as much as you can afford.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> And give the physician his place, for the Lord created him;<br>
  let him not leave you, for there is need of him.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> There is a time when success lies in the hands of physicians,<br>
  <sup>14</sup> for they too will pray to the Lord<br>
  that he should grant them success in diagnosis<br>
  and in healing, for the sake of preserving life.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> He who sins before his Maker,<br>
  may he fall into the care of a physician.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> My son, let your tears fall for the dead,<br>
  and as one who is suffering grievously begin the lament.<br>
  Lay out his body with the honor due him,<br>
  and do not neglect his burial.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Let your weeping be bitter and your wailing fervent;<br>
  observe the mourning according to his merit,<br>
  for one day, or two, to avoid criticism;<br>
  then be comforted for your sorrow.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> For sorrow results in death,<br>
  and sorrow of heart saps one's strength.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> In calamity sorrow continues,<br>
  and the life of the poor man weighs down his heart.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Do not give your heart to sorrow;<br>
  drive it away, remembering the end of life.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> Do not forget, there is no coming back;<br>
  you do the dead no good, and you injure yourself.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> "Remember my doom, for yours is like it:<br>
  yesterday it was mine, and today it is yours."<br>
  <sup>23</sup> When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance cease,<br>
  and be comforted for him when his spirit is departed.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> The wisdom of the scribe depends on the opportunity of leisure;<br>
  and he who has little business may become wise.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> How can he become wise who handles the plow,<br>
  and who glories in the shaft of a goad,<br>
  who drives oxen and is occupied with their work,<br>
  and whose talk is about bulls?<br>
  <sup>26</sup> He sets his heart on plowing furrows,<br>
  and he is careful about fodder for the heifers.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> So too is every craftsman and master workman<br>
  who labors by night as well as by day;<br>
  those who cut the signets of seals,<br>
  each is diligent in making a great variety;<br>
  he sets his heart on painting a lifelike image,<br>
  and he is careful to finish his work.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> So too is the smith sitting by the anvil,<br>
  intent upon his handiwork in iron;<br>
  the breath of the fire melts his flesh,<br>
  and he wastes away in the heat of the furnace;<br>
  he inclines his ear to the sound of the hammer,<br>
  and his eyes are on the pattern of the object.<br>
  He sets his heart on finishing his handiwork,<br>
  and he is careful to complete its decoration.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> So too is the potter sitting at his work<br>
  and turning the wheel with his feet;<br>
  he is always deeply concerned over his work,<br>
  and all his output is by number.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> He moulds the clay with his arm<br>
  and makes it pliable with his feet;<br>
  he sets his heart to finish the glazing,<br>
  and he is careful to clean the furnace.<br>
  <sup>31</sup> All these rely upon their hands,<br>
  and each is skilful in his own work.<br>
  <sup>32</sup> Without them a city cannot be established,<br>
  and men can neither sojourn nor live there.<br>
  <sup>33</sup> Yet they are not sought out for the council of the people,<br>
  nor do they attain eminence in the public assembly.<br>
  They do not sit in the judge's seat,<br>
  nor do they understand the sentence of judgment;<br>
  they cannot expound discipline or judgment,<br>
  and they are not found using proverbs.<br>
  <sup>34</sup> But they keep stable the fabric of the world,<br>
  and their prayer is in the practice of their trade.</p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 39</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> On the other hand he who devotes himself<br>
  to the study of the law of the Most High<br>
  will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients,<br>
  and will be concerned with prophecies;<br>
  <sup>2</sup> he will preserve the discourse of notable men<br>
  and penetrate the subtleties of parables;<br>
  <sup>3</sup> he will seek out the hidden meanings of proverbs<br>
  and be at home with the obscurities of parables.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> He will serve among great men<br>
  and appear before rulers;<br>
  he will travel through the lands of foreign nations, <br>
  for he tests the good and the evil among men.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> He will set his heart to rise early <br>
  to seek the Lord who made him,<br>
  and will make supplication before the Most High;<br>
  he will open his mouth in prayer<br>
  and make supplication for his sins.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> If the great Lord is willing, <br>
  he will be filled with the spirit of understanding;<br>
  he will pour forth words of wisdom <br>
  and give thanks to the Lord in prayer.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> He will direct his counsel and knowledge aright, <br>
  and meditate on his secrets.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> He will reveal instruction in his teaching, <br>
  and will glory in the law of the Lord's covenant.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> Many will praise his understanding, <br>
  and it will never be blotted out; <br>
  his memory will not disappear,<br>
  and his name will live through all generations.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Nations will declare his wisdom,<br>
  and the congregation will proclaim his praise;<br>
  <sup>11</sup> if he lives long, he will leave a name greater than a thousand,<br>
  and if he goes to rest, it is enough for him.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> I have yet more to say, which I have thought upon, <br>
  and I am filled, like the moon at the full.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Listen to me, O you holy sons,<br>
  and bud like a rose growing by a stream of water;<br>
  <sup>14</sup> send forth fragrance like frankincense,<br>
  and put forth blossoms like a lily.<br>
  Scatter the fragrance, and sing a hymn of praise;<br>
  bless the Lord for all his works;<br>
  <sup>15</sup> ascribe majesty to his name<br>
  and give thanks to him with praise,<br>
  with songs on your lips, and with lyres;<br>
  and this you shall say in thanksgiving:<br>
  <sup>16</sup> "All things are the works of the Lord, for they are very good,<br>
  and whatever he commands will be done in his time."<br>
  <sup>17</sup> No one can say, "What is this?" "Why is that?"<br>
  for in God's time all things will be sought after.<br>
  At his word the waters stood in a heap,<br>
  and the reservoirs of water at the word of his mouth.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> At his command whatever pleases him is done,<br>
  and none can limit his saving power.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> The works of all flesh are before him,<br>
  and nothing can be hid from his eyes.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> From everlasting to everlasting he beholds them,<br>
  and nothing is marvelous to him.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> No one can say, "What is this?" "Why is that?"<br>
  for everything has been created for its use.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> His blessing covers the dry land like a river,<br>
  and drenches it like a flood.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> The nations will incur his wrath,<br>
  just as he turns fresh water into salt.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> To the holy his ways are straight,<br>
  just as they are obstacles to the wicked.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> From the beginning good things were created for good people,<br>
  just as evil things for sinners.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> Basic to all the needs of man's life<br>
  are water and fire and iron and salt<br>
  and wheat flour and milk and honey,<br>
  the blood of the grape, and oil and clothing.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> All these are for good to the godly,<br>
  just as they turn into evils for sinners.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> There are winds that have been created for vengeance,<br>
  and in their anger they scourge heavily;<br>
  in the time of consummation they will pour out their strength<br>
  and calm the anger of their Maker.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> Fire and hail and famine and pestilence,<br>
  all these have been created for vengeance;<br>
  <sup>30</sup> the teeth of wild beasts, and scorpions and vipers,<br>
  and the sword that punishes the ungodly with destruction;<br>
  <sup>31</sup> they will rejoice in his commands,<br>
  and be made ready on earth for their service,<br>
  and when their times come they will not transgress his word.<br>
  <sup>32</sup> Therefore from the beginning I have been convinced,<br>
  and have thought this out and left it in writing:<br>
  <sup>33</sup> The works of the Lord are all good,<br>
  and he will supply every need in its hour.<br>
  <sup>34</sup> And no one can say, "This is worse than that,"<br>
  for all things will prove good in their season.<br>
  <sup>35</sup> So now sing praise with all your heart and voice,<br>
  and bless the name of the Lord. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 40</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Much labor was created for every man,<br>
  and a heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam,<br>
  from the day they come forth from their mother's womb<br>
  till the day they return to the mother of all.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> Their perplexities and fear of heart --<br>
  their anxious thought is the day of death,<br>
  <sup>3</sup> from the man who sits on a splendid throne<br>
  to the one who is humbled in dust and ashes,<br>
  <sup>4</sup> from the man who wears purple and a crown<br>
  to the one who is clothed in burlap;<br>
  <sup>5</sup> there is anger and envy and trouble and unrest,<br>
  and fear of death, and fury and strife.<br>
  And when one rests upon his bed,<br>
  his sleep at night confuses his mind.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> He gets little or no rest,<br>
  and afterward in his sleep, as though he were on watch,<br>
  he is troubled by the visions of his mind<br>
  like one who has escaped from the battle-front;<br>
  <sup>7</sup> at the moment of his rescue he wakes up,<br>
  and wonders that his fear came to nothing.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> With all flesh, both man and beast,<br>
  and upon sinners seven times more,<br>
  <sup>9</sup> are death and bloodshed and strife and sword,<br>
  calamities, famine and affliction and plague.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> All these were created for the wicked,<br>
  and on their account the flood came.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> All things that are from the earth turn back to the earth,<br>
  and what is from the waters returns to the sea.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> All bribery and injustice will be blotted out,<br>
  but good faith will stand for ever.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> The wealth of the unjust will dry up like a torrent,<br>
  and crash like a loud clap of thunder in a rain.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> A generous man will be made glad;<br>
  likewise transgressors will utterly fail.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> The children of the ungodly will not put forth many branches;<br>
  they are unhealthy roots upon sheer rock.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> The reeds by any water or river bank<br>
  will be plucked up before any grass.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Kindness is like a garden of blessings,<br>
  and almsgiving endures for ever.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Life is sweet for the self-reliant and the worker,<br>
  but he who finds treasure is better off than both.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Children and the building of a city establish a man's name,<br>
  but a blameless wife is accounted better than both.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Wine and music gladden the heart,<br>
  but the love of wisdom is better than both.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> The flute and the harp make pleasant melody,<br>
  but a pleasant voice is better than both.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> The eye desires grace and beauty,<br>
  but the green shoots of grain more than both.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> A friend or a companion never meets one amiss,<br>
  but a wife with her husband is better than both.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Brothers and help are for a time of trouble,<br>
  but almsgiving rescues better than both.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> Gold and silver make the foot stand sure,<br>
  but good counsel is esteemed more than both.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> Riches and strength lift up the heart,<br>
  but the fear of the Lord is better than both.<br>
  There is no loss in the fear of the Lord,<br>
  and with it there is no need to seek for help.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> The fear of the Lord is like a garden of blessing,<br>
  and covers a man better than any glory.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> My son, do not lead the life of a beggar;<br>
  it is better to die than to beg.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> When a man looks to the table of another,<br>
  his existence cannot be considered as life.<br>
  He pollutes himself with another man's food,<br>
  but a man who is intelligent and well instructed<br>
  guards against that.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> In the mouth of the shameless begging is sweet,<br>
  but in his stomach a fire is kindled. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 41</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> O death, how bitter is the reminder of you<br>
  to one who lives at peace among his possessions,<br>
  to a man without distractions, who is prosperous in everything,<br>
  and who still has the vigor to enjoy his food!<br>
  <sup>2</sup> O death, how welcome is your sentence<br>
  to one who is in need and is failing in strength,<br>
  very old and distracted over everything;<br>
  to one who is contrary, and has lost his patience!<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Do not fear the sentence of death;<br>
  remember your former days and the end of life;<br>
  this is the decree from the Lord for all flesh,<br>
  <sup>4</sup> and how can you reject the good pleasure of the Most High?<br>
  Whether life is for ten or a hundred or a thousand years,<br>
  there is no inquiry about it in Hades.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> The children of sinners are abominable children,<br>
  and they frequent the haunts of the ungodly.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> The inheritance of the children of sinners will perish,<br>
  and on their posterity will be a perpetual reproach.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Children will blame an ungodly father,<br>
  for they suffer reproach because of him.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Woe to you, ungodly men,<br>
  who have forsaken the law of the Most High God!<br>
  <sup>9</sup> When you are born, you are born to a curse;<br>
  and when you die, a curse is your lot.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> Whatever is from the dust returns to dust;<br>
  so the ungodly go from curse to destruction.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> The mourning of men is about their bodies,<br>
  but the evil name of sinners will be blotted out.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Have regard for your name, since it will remain for<br>
  you longer than a thousand great stores of gold.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> The days of a good life are numbered,<br>
  but a good name endures for ever.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> My children, observe instruction and be at peace;<br>
  hidden wisdom and unseen treasure,<br>
  what advantage is there in either of them?<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Better is the man who hides his folly<br>
  than the man who hides his wisdom.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Therefore show respect for my words:<br>
  For it is good to retain every kind of shame,<br>
  and not everything is confidently esteemed by every one.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Be ashamed of immorality, before your father or mother;<br>
  and of a lie, before a prince or a ruler;<br>
  <sup>18</sup> of a transgression, before a judge or magistrate;<br>
  and of iniquity, before a congregation or the people;<br>
  of unjust dealing, before your partner or friend;<br>
  <sup>19</sup> and of theft, in the place where you live.<br>
  Be ashamed before the truth of God and his covenant.<br>
  Be ashamed of selfish behavior at meals,<br>
  of surliness in receiving and giving,<br>
  <sup>20</sup> and of silence, before those who greet you;<br>
  of looking at a woman who is a harlot,<br>
  <sup>21</sup> and of rejecting the appeal of a kinsman;<br>
  of taking away some one's portion or gift,<br>
  and of gazing at another man's wife;<br>
  <sup>22</sup> of meddling with his maidservant --<br>
  and do not approach her bed;<br>
  of abusive words, before friends --<br>
  and do not upbraid after making a gift;<br>
  <sup>23</sup> of repeating and telling what you hear,<br>
  and of revealing secrets.<br>
  Then you will show proper shame,<br>
  and will find favor with every man.</p><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 42</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Of the following things do not be ashamed,<br>
  and do not let partiality lead you to sin:<br>
  <sup>2</sup> of the law of the Most High and his covenant,<br>
  and of rendering judgment to acquit the ungodly;<br>
  <sup>3</sup> of keeping accounts with a partner or with<br>
  traveling companions,<br>
  and of dividing the inheritance of friends;<br>
  <sup>4</sup> of accuracy with scales and weights,<br>
  and of acquiring much or little;<br>
  <sup>5</sup> of profit from dealing with merchants,<br>
  and of much discipline of children,<br>
  and of whipping a wicked servant severely.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Where there is an evil wife, a seal is a good thing;<br>
  and where there are many hands, lock things up.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> Whatever you deal out, let it be by number and weight,<br>
  and make a record of all that you give out or take in.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Do not be ashamed to instruct the stupid or foolish<br>
  or the aged man who quarrels with the young.<br>
  Then you will be truly instructed,<br>
  and will be approved before all men.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> A daughter keeps her father secretly wakeful,<br>
  and worry over her robs him of sleep;<br>
  when she is young, lest she do not marry,<br>
  or if married, lest she be hated;<br>
  <sup>10</sup> while a virgin, lest she be defiled<br>
  or become pregnant in her father's house;<br>
  or having a husband, lest she prove unfaithful,<br>
  or, though married, lest she be barren.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Keep strict watch over a headstrong daughter,<br>
  lest she make you a laughingstock to your enemies,<br>
  a byword in the city and notorious among the people,<br>
  and put you to shame before the great multitude.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Do not look upon any one for beauty,<br>
  and do not sit in the midst of women;<br>
  <sup>13</sup> for from garments comes the moth,<br>
  and from a woman comes woman's wickedness.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Better is the wickedness of a man than a woman who does good;<br>
  and it is a woman who brings shame and disgrace.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> I will now call to mind the works of the Lord,<br>
  and will declare what I have seen.<br>
  By the words of the Lord his works are done.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> The sun looks down on everything with its light,<br>
  and the work of the Lord is full of his glory.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> The Lord has not enabled his holy ones<br>
  to recount all his marvelous works,<br>
  which the Lord the Almighty has established<br>
  that the universe may stand firm in his glory.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> He searches out the abyss, and the hearts of men,<br>
  and considers their crafty devices.<br>
  For the Most High knows all that may be known,<br>
  and he looks into the signs of the age.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> He declares what has been and what is to be,<br>
  and he reveals the tracks of hidden things.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> No thought escapes him,<br>
  and not one word is hidden from him.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> He has ordained the splendors of his wisdom,<br>
  and he is from everlasting and to everlasting.<br>
  Nothing can be added or taken away,<br>
  and he needs no one to be his counselor.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> How greatly to be desired are all his works,<br>
  and how sparkling they are to see!<br>
  <sup>23</sup> All these things live and remain for ever<br>
  for every need, and are all obedient.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> All things are twofold, one opposite the other,<br>
  and he has made nothing incomplete.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> One confirms the good things of the other,<br>
  and who can have enough of beholding his glory? </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 43</h2>
  
  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> The pride of the heavenly heights is the clear firmament,<br>
  the appearance of heaven in a spectacle of glory.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> The sun, when it appears, making proclamation as it goes forth,<br>
  is a marvelous instrument, the work of the Most High.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> At noon it parches the land;<br>
  and who can withstand its burning heat?<br>
  <sup>4</sup> A man tending a furnace works in burning heat,<br>
  but the sun burns the mountains three times as much;<br>
  it breathes out fiery vapors,<br>
  and with bright beams it blinds the eyes.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> Great is the Lord who made it;<br>
  and at his command it hastens on its course.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> He made the moon also, to serve in its season<br>
  to mark the times and to be an everlasting sign.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> From the moon comes the sign for feast days,<br>
  a light that wanes when it has reached the full.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> The month is named for the moon,<br>
  increasing marvelously in its phases,<br>
  an instrument of the hosts on high<br>
  shining forth in the firmament of heaven.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> The glory of the stars is the beauty of heaven,<br>
  a gleaming array in the heights of the Lord.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> At the command of the Holy One they stand as ordered,<br>
  they never relax in their watches.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Look upon the rainbow, and praise him who made it,<br>
  exceedingly beautiful in its brightness.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> It encircles the heaven with its glorious arc;<br>
  the hands of the Most High have stretched it out.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> By his command he sends the driving snow<br>
  and speeds the lightnings of his judgment.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Therefore the storehouses are opened,<br>
  and the clouds fly forth like birds.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> In his majesty he amasses the clouds,<br>
  and the hailstones are broken in pieces.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> At his appearing the mountains are shaken;<br>
  at his will the south wind blows.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> The voice of his thunder rebukes the earth;<br>
  so do the tempest from the north and the whirlwind.<br>
  He scatters the snow like birds flying down,<br>
  and its descent is like locusts alighting.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> The eye marvels at the beauty of its whiteness,<br>
  and the mind is amazed at its falling.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> He pours the hoarfrost upon the earth like salt,<br>
  and when it freezes, it becomes pointed thorns.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> The cold north wind blows,<br>
  and ice freezes over the water;<br>
  it rests upon every pool of water,<br>
  and the water puts it on like a breastplate.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> He consumes the mountains and burns up the wilderness,<br>
  and withers the tender grass like fire.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> A mist quickly heals all things;<br>
  when the dew appears, it refreshes from the heat.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> By his counsel he stilled the great deep<br>
  and planted islands in it.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Those who sail the sea tell of its dangers,<br>
  and we marvel at what we hear.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> for in it are strange and marvelous works,<br>
  all kinds of living things, and huge creatures of the sea.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> Because of him his messenger finds the way,<br>
  and by his word all things hold together.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> Though we speak much we cannot reach the end,<br>
  and the sum of our words is: "He is the all."<br>
  <sup>28</sup> Where shall we find strength to praise him?<br>
  For he is greater than all his works.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> Terrible is the Lord and very great,<br>
  and marvelous is his power.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> When you praise the Lord, exalt him as much as you can;<br>
  for he will surpass even that.<br>
  When you exalt him, put forth all your strength,<br>
  and do not grow weary, for you cannot praise him enough.<br>
  <sup>31</sup> Who has seen him and can describe him?<br>
  Or who can extol him as he is?<br>
  <sup>32</sup> Many things greater than these lie hidden,<br>
  for we have seen but few of his works.<br>
  <sup>33</sup> For the Lord has made all things,<br>
  and to the godly he has granted wisdom. </p><br><br>

  <sup>1</sup> Let us now praise famous men,<br>
  and our fathers in their generations.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> The Lord apportioned to them great glory,<br>
  his majesty from the beginning.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> There were those who ruled in their kingdoms,<br>
  and were men renowned for their power,<br>
  giving counsel by their understanding,<br>
  and proclaiming prophecies;<br>
  <sup>4</sup> leaders of the people in their deliberations<br>
  and in understanding of learning for the people,<br>
  wise in their words of instruction;<br>
  <sup>5</sup> those who composed musical tunes,<br>
  and set forth verses in writing;<br>
  <sup>6</sup> rich men furnished with resources,<br>
  living peaceably in their habitations --<br>
  <sup>7</sup> all these were honored in their generations,<br>
  and were the glory of their times.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> There are some of them who have left a name,<br>
  so that men declare their praise.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> And there are some who have no memorial,<br>
  who have perished as though they had not lived;<br>
  they have become as though they had not been born,<br>
  and so have their children after them.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> But these were men of mercy,<br>
  whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten;<br>
  <sup>11</sup> their prosperity will remain with their descendants,<br>
  and their inheritance to their children's children.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> Their descendants stand by the covenants;<br>
  their children also, for their sake.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Their posterity will continue for ever,<br>
  and their glory will not be blotted out.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Their bodies were buried in peace,<br>
  and their name lives to all generations.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Peoples will declare their wisdom,<br>
  and the congregation proclaims their praise.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Enoch pleased the Lord, and was taken up;<br>
  he was an example of repentance to all generations.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Noah was found perfect and righteous;<br>
  in the time of wrath he was taken in exchange;<br>
  therefore a remnant was left to the earth<br>
  when the flood came.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Everlasting covenants were made with him<br>
  that all flesh should not be blotted out by a flood.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Abraham was the great father of a multitude of nations,<br>
  and no one has been found like him in glory;<br>
  <sup>20</sup> he kept the law of the Most High,<br>
  and was taken into covenant with him;<br>
  he established the covenant in his flesh,<br>
  and when he was tested he was found faithful.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> Therefore the Lord assured him by an oath<br>
  that the nations would be blessed through his posterity;<br>
  that he would multiply him like the dust of the earth,<br>
  and exalt his posterity like the stars,<br>
  and cause them to inherit from sea to sea<br>
  and from the River to the ends of the earth.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> To Isaac also he gave the same assurance<br>
  for the sake of Abraham his father.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> The blessing of all men and the covenant<br>
  he made to rest upon the head of Jacob;<br>
  he acknowledged him with his blessings,<br>
  and gave him his inheritance;<br>
  he determined his portions,<br>
  and distributed them among twelve tribes. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 45</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> From his descendants the Lord brought forth a man of mercy,<br>
  who found favor in the sight of all flesh<br>
  and was beloved by God and man,<br>
  Moses, whose memory is blessed.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> He made him equal in glory to the holy ones,<br>
  and made him great in the fears of his enemies.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> By his words he caused signs to cease;<br>
  the Lord glorified him in the presence of kings.<br>
  He gave him commands for his people,<br>
  and showed him part of his glory.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> He sanctified him through faithfulness and meekness;<br>
  he chose him out of all mankind.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> He made him hear his voice,<br>
  and led him into the thick darkness,<br>
  and gave him the commandments face to face,<br>
  the law of life and knowledge,<br>
  to teach Jacob the covenant,<br>
  and Israel his judgments.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> He exalted Aaron, the brother of Moses,<br>
  a holy man like him, of the tribe of Levi.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> He made an everlasting covenant with him,<br>
  and gave him the priesthood of the people.<br>
  He blessed him with splendid vestments,<br>
  and put a glorious robe upon him.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> He clothed him with superb perfection,<br>
  and strengthened him with the symbols of authority,<br>
  the linen breeches, the long robe, and the ephod.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> And he encircled him with pomegranates,<br>
  with very many golden bells round about,<br>
  to send forth a sound as he walked,<br>
  to make their ringing heard in the temple<br>
  as a reminder to the sons of his people;<br>
  <sup>10</sup> with a holy garment, of gold and blue<br>
  and purple, the work of an embroiderer;<br>
  with the oracle of judgment, Urim and Thummim;<br>
  <sup>11</sup> with twisted scarlet, the work of a craftsman;<br>
  with precious stones engraved like signets,<br>
  in a setting of gold, the work of a jeweler,<br>
  for a reminder, in engraved letters,<br>
  according to the number of the tribes of Israel;<br>
  <sup>12</sup> with a gold crown upon his turban,<br>
  inscribed like a signet with "Holiness,"<br>
  a distinction to be prized, the work of an expert,<br>
  the delight of the eyes, richly adorned.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Before his time there never were such beautiful things.<br>
  No outsider ever put them on,<br>
  but only his sons<br>
  and his descendants perpetually.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> His sacrifices shall be wholly burned<br>
  twice every day continually.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Moses ordained him,<br>
  and anointed him with holy oil;<br>
  it was an everlasting covenant for him<br>
  and for his descendants all the days of heaven,<br>
  to minister to the Lord and serve as priest<br>
  and bless his people in his name.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> He chose him out of all the living<br>
  to offer sacrifice to the Lord,<br>
  incense and a pleasing odor as a memorial portion,<br>
  to make atonement for the people.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> In his commandments he gave him<br>
  authority and statutes and judgments,<br>
  to teach Jacob the testimonies,<br>
  and to enlighten Israel with his law.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> Outsiders conspired against him,<br>
  and envied him in the wilderness,<br>
  Dathan and Abiram and their men<br>
  and the company of Korah, in wrath and anger.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> The Lord saw it and was not pleased,<br>
  and in the wrath of his anger they were destroyed;<br>
  he wrought wonders against them<br>
  to consume them in flaming fire.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> He added glory to Aaron<br>
  and gave him a heritage;<br>
  he allotted to him the first of the first fruits,<br>
  he prepared bread of first fruits in abundance;<br>
  <sup>21</sup> for they eat the sacrifices to the Lord,<br>
  which he gave to him and his descendants.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> But in the land of the people he has no inheritance,<br>
  and he has no portion among the people;<br>
  for the Lord himself is his portion and inheritance.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Phinehas the son of Eleazar is the third in glory,<br>
  for he was zealous in the fear of the Lord,<br>
  and stood fast, when the people turned away,<br>
  in the ready goodness of his soul,<br>
  and made atonement for Israel.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Therefore a covenant of peace was established with him,<br>
  that he should be leader of the sanctuary and of his people,<br>
  that he and his descendants should have<br>
  the dignity of the priesthood for ever.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> A covenant was also established with David,<br>
  the son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah:<br>
  the heritage of the king is from son to son only;<br>
  so the heritage of Aaron is for his descendants.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> May the Lord grant you wisdom in your heart<br>
  to judge his people in righteousness,<br>
  so that their prosperity may not vanish,<br>
  and that their glory may endure throughout their generations. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 46</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Joshua the son of Nun was mighty in war,<br>
  and was the successor of Moses in prophesying.<br>
  He became, in accordance with his name,<br>
  a great savior of God's elect,<br>
  to take vengeance on the enemies that rose against them,<br>
  so that he might give Israel its inheritance.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> How glorious he was when he lifted his hands<br>
  and stretched out his sword against the cities!<br>
  <sup>3</sup> Who before him ever stood so firm?<br>
  For he waged the wars of the Lord.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Was not the sun held back by his hand?<br>
  And did not one day become as long as two?<br>
  <sup>5</sup> He called upon the Most High, the Mighty One,<br>
  when enemies pressed him on every side,<br>
  <sup>6</sup> and the great Lord answered him<br>
  with hailstones of mighty power.<br>
  He hurled down war upon that nation,<br>
  and at the descent of Beth-horon he destroyed<br>
  those who resisted, <br>
  so that the nations might know his armament,<br>
  that he was fighting in the sight of the Lord;<br>
  for he wholly followed the Mighty One.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> And in the days of Moses he did a loyal deed,<br>
  he and Caleb the son of Jephunneh:<br>
  they withstood the congregation,<br>
  restrained the people from sin,<br>
  and stilled their wicked murmuring.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> And these two alone were preserved<br>
  out of six hundred thousand people on foot,<br>
  to bring them into their inheritance,<br>
  into a land flowing with milk and honey.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> And the Lord gave Caleb strength,<br>
  which remained with him to old age,<br>
  so that he went up to the hill country,<br>
  and his children obtained it for an inheritance;<br>
  <sup>10</sup> so that all the sons of Israel might see<br>
  that it is good to follow the Lord.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> The judges also, with their respective names,<br>
  those whose hearts did not fall into idolatry<br>
  and who did not turn away from the Lord --<br>
  may their memory be blessed!<br>
  <sup>12</sup> May their bones revive from where they lie,<br>
  and may the name of those who have been honored<br>
  live again in their sons!<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Samuel, beloved by his Lord,<br>
  a prophet of the Lord, established the kingdom<br>
  and anointed rulers over his people.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation,<br>
  and the Lord watched over Jacob.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> By his faithfulness he was proved to be a prophet,<br>
  and by his words he became known as a trustworthy seer.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> He called upon the Lord, the Mighty One,<br>
  when his enemies pressed him on every side,<br>
  and he offered in sacrifice a sucking lamb.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Then the Lord thundered from heaven,<br>
  and made his voice heard with a mighty sound;<br>
  <sup>18</sup> and he wiped out the leaders of the people of Tyre<br>
  and all the rulers of the Philistines.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Before the time of his eternal sleep,<br>
  Samuel called men to witness before the Lord and his anointed:<br>
  "I have not taken any one's property,<br>
  not so much as a pair of shoes."<br>
  And no man accused him.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Even after he had fallen asleep he prophesied<br>
  and revealed to the king his death,<br>
  and lifted up his voice out of the earth in prophecy,<br>
  to blot out the wickedness of the people. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 47</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> And after him Nathan rose up<br>
  to prophesy in the days of David.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> As the fat is selected from the peace offering,<br>
  so David was selected from the sons of Israel.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> He played with lions as with young goats,<br>
  and with bears as with lambs of the flock.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> In his youth did he not kill a giant,<br>
  and take away reproach from the people,<br>
  when he lifted his hand with a stone in the sling<br>
  and struck down the boasting of Goliath?<br>
  <sup>5</sup> For he appealed to the Lord, the Most High,<br>
  and he gave him strength in his right hand<br>
  to slay a man mighty in war,<br>
  to exalt the power of his people.<br>
  <sup>6</sup> So they glorified him for his ten thousands,<br>
  and praised him for the blessings of the Lord,<br>
  when the glorious diadem was bestowed upon him.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> For he wiped out his enemies on every side,<br>
  and annihilated his adversaries the Philistines;<br>
  he crushed their power even to this day.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> In all that he did he gave thanks<br>
  to the Holy One, the Most High, with ascriptions of glory;<br>
  he sang praise with all his heart,<br>
  and he loved his Maker.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> He placed singers before the altar,<br>
  to make sweet melody with their voices.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> He gave beauty to the feasts,<br>
  and arranged their times throughout the year,<br>
  while they praised God's holy name,<br>
  and the sanctuary resounded from early morning.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> The Lord took away his sins,<br>
  and exalted his power for ever;<br>
  he gave him the covenant of kings<br>
  and a throne of glory in Israel.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> After him rose up a wise son<br>
  who fared amply because of him;<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Solomon reigned in days of peace,<br>
  and God gave him rest on every side,<br>
  that he might build a house for his name<br>
  and prepare a sanctuary to stand for ever.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> How wise you became in your youth!<br>
  You overflowed like a river with understanding.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> Your soul covered the earth,<br>
  and you filled it with parables and riddles.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Your name reached to far-off islands,<br>
  and you were loved for your peace.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> For your songs and proverbs and parables,<br>
  and for your interpretations, the countries marveled at you.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> In the name of the Lord God,<br>
  who is called the God of Israel,<br>
  you gathered gold like tin<br>
  and amassed silver like lead.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> But you laid your loins beside women,<br>
  and through your body you were brought into subjection.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> You put stain upon your honor,<br>
  and defiled your posterity,<br>
  so that you brought wrath upon your children<br>
  and they were grieved at your folly,<br>
  <sup>21</sup> so that the sovereignty was divided<br>
  and a disobedient kingdom arose out of Ephraim.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> But the Lord will never give up his mercy,<br>
  nor cause any of his works to perish;<br>
  he will never blot out the descendants of his chosen one,<br>
  nor destroy the posterity of him who loved him;<br>
  so he gave a remnant to Jacob,<br>
  and to David a root of his stock.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Solomon rested with his fathers,<br>
  and left behind him one of his sons,<br>
  ample in folly and lacking in understanding,<br>
  Rehoboam, whose policy caused the people to revolt.<br>
  Also Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin<br>
  and gave to Ephraim a sinful way.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Their sins became exceedingly many,<br>
  so as to remove them from their land.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> For they sought out every sort of wickedness,<br>
  till vengeance came upon them. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 48</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> Then the prophet Elijah arose like a fire,<br>
  and his word burned like a torch.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> He brought a famine upon them,<br>
  and by his zeal he made them few in number.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> By the word of the Lord he shut up the heavens,<br>
  and also three times brought down fire.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> How glorious you were, O Elijah, in your wondrous deeds!<br>
  And who has the right to boast which you have?<br>
  <sup>5</sup> You who raised a corpse from death<br>
  and from Hades, by the word of the Most High;<br>
  <sup>6</sup> who brought kings down to destruction,<br>
  and famous men from their beds;<br>
  <sup>7</sup> who heard rebuke at Sinai<br>
  and judgments of vengeance at Horeb;<br>
  <sup>8</sup> who anointed kings to inflict retribution,<br>
  and prophets to succeed you.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> You who were taken up by a whirlwind of fire,<br>
  in a chariot with horses of fire;<br>
  <sup>10</sup> you who are ready at the appointed time, it is written,<br>
  to calm the wrath of God before it breaks out in fury,<br>
  to turn the heart of the father to the son,<br>
  and to restore the tribes of Jacob.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> Blessed are those who saw you,<br>
  and those who have been adorned in love;<br>
  for we also shall surely live.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> It was Elijah who was covered by the whirlwind,<br>
  and Elisha was filled with his spirit;<br>
  in all his days he did not tremble before any ruler,<br>
  and no one brought him into subjection.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> Nothing was too hard for him,<br>
  and when he was dead his body prophesied.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> As in his life he did wonders,<br>
  so in death his deeds were marvelous.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> For all this the people did not repent,<br>
  and they did not forsake their sins,<br>
  till they were carried away captive from their land<br>
  and were scattered over all the earth;<br>
  the people were left very few in number,<br>
  but with rulers from the house of David.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Some of them did what was pleasing to God,<br>
  but others multiplied sins.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Hezekiah fortified his city,<br>
  and brought water into the midst of it;<br>
  he tunneled the sheer rock with iron<br>
  and built pools for water.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> In his days Sennacherib came up,<br>
  and sent the Rabshakeh;<br>
  he lifted up his hand against Zion<br>
  and made great boasts in his arrogance.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> Then their hearts were shaken and their hands trembled,<br>
  and they were in anguish, like women in travail.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> But they called upon the Lord who is merciful,<br>
  spreading forth their hands toward him;<br>
  and the Holy One quickly heard them from heaven,<br>
  and delivered them by the hand of Isaiah.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> The Lord smote the camp of the Assyrians,<br>
  and his angel wiped them out.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> For Hezekiah did what was pleasing to the Lord,<br>
  and he held strongly to the ways of David his father,<br>
  which Isaiah the prophet commanded,<br>
  who was great and faithful in his vision.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> In his days the sun went backward,<br>
  and he lengthened the life of the king.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> By the spirit of might he saw the last things,<br>
  and comforted those who mourned in Zion.<br>
  <sup>25</sup> He revealed what was to occur to the end of time,<br>
  and the hidden things before they came to pass. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 49</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> The memory of Josiah is like a blending of incense<br>
  prepared by the art of the perfumer;<br>
  it is sweet as honey to every mouth,<br>
  and like music at a banquet of wine.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> He was led aright in converting the people,<br>
  and took away the abominations of iniquity.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> He set his heart upon the Lord;<br>
  in the days of wicked men he strengthened godliness.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> Except David and Hezekiah and Josiah<br>
  they all sinned greatly,<br>
  for they forsook the law of the Most High;<br>
  the kings of Judah came to an end;<br>
  <sup>5</sup> for they gave their power to others,<br>
  and their glory to a foreign nation,<br>
  <sup>6</sup> who set fire to the chosen city of the sanctuary,<br>
  and made her streets desolate,<br>
  according to the word of Jeremiah.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> For they had afflicted him;<br>
  yet he had been consecrated in the womb as prophet,<br>
  to pluck up and afflict and destroy,<br>
  and likewise to build and to plant.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> It was Ezekiel who saw the vision of glory<br>
  which God showed him above the chariot of the cherubim.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> For God remembered his enemies with storm,<br>
  and did good to those who directed their ways aright.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> May the bones of the twelve prophets<br>
  revive from where they lie,<br>
  for they comforted the people of Jacob<br>
  and delivered them with confident hope.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> How shall we magnify Zerubbabel?<br>
  He was like a signet on the right hand,<br>
  <sup>12</sup> and so was Jeshua the son of Jozadak;<br>
  in their days they built the house<br>
  and raised a temple holy to the Lord,<br>
  prepared for everlasting glory.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> The memory of Nehemiah also is lasting;<br>
  he raised for us the walls that had fallen,<br>
  and set up the gates and bars<br>
  and rebuilt our ruined houses.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> No one like Enoch has been created on earth,<br>
  for he was taken up from the earth.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> And no man like Joseph has been born,<br>
  and his bones are cared for.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Shem and Seth were honored among men,<br>
  and Adam above every living being in the creation. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 50</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> The leader of his brethren and the pride of his people<br>
  was Simon the high priest, son of Onias,<br>
  who in his life repaired the house,<br>
  and in his time fortified the temple.<br>
  <sup>2</sup> He laid the foundations for the high double walls,<br>
  the high retaining walls for the temple enclosure.<br>
  <sup>3</sup> In his days a cistern for water was quarried out,<br>
  a reservoir like the sea in circumference.<br>
  <sup>4</sup> He considered how to save his people from ruin,<br>
  and fortified the city to withstand a seige.<br>
  <sup>5</sup> How glorious he was when the people gathered round him<br>
  as he came out of the inner sanctuary!<br>
  <sup>6</sup> Like the morning star among the clouds,<br>
  like the moon when it is full;<br>
  <sup>7</sup> like the sun shining upon the temple of the Most High,<br>
  and like the rainbow gleaming in glorious clouds;<br>
  <sup>8</sup> like roses in the days of the first fruits,<br>
  like lilies by a spring of water,<br>
  like a green shoot on Lebanon on a summer day;<br>
  <sup>9</sup> like fire and incense in the censer,<br>
  like a vessel of hammered gold<br>
  adorned with all kinds of precious stones;<br>
  <sup>10</sup> like an olive tree putting forth its fruit,<br>
  and like a cypress towering in the clouds.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> When he put on his glorious robe<br>
  and clothed himself with superb perfection<br>
  and went up to the holy altar,<br>
  he made the court of the sanctuary glorious.<br>
  <sup>12</sup> And when he received the portions from the<br>
  hands of the priests,<br>
  as he stood by the hearth of the altar<br>
  with a garland of brethren around him,<br>
  he was like a young cedar on Lebanon;<br>
  and they surrounded him like the trunks of palm trees,<br>
  <sup>13</sup> all the sons of Aaron in their splendor<br>
  with the Lord's offering in their hands,<br>
  before the whole congregation of Israel.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Finishing the service at the altars,<br>
  and arranging the offering to the Most High, the Almighty,<br>
  <sup>15</sup> he reached out his hand to the cup<br>
  and poured a libation of the blood of the grape;<br>
  he poured it out at the foot of the altar,<br>
  a pleasing odor to the Most High, the King of all.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> Then the sons of Aaron shouted,<br>
  they sounded the trumpets of hammered work,<br>
  they made a great noise to be heard<br>
  for remembrance before the Most High.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> Then all the people together made haste<br>
  and fell to the ground upon their faces<br>
  to worship their Lord,<br>
  the Almighty, God Most High.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> And the singers praised him with their voices<br>
  in sweet and full-toned melody.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> And the people besought the Lord Most High<br>
  in prayer before him who is merciful,<br>
  till the order of worship of the Lord was ended;<br>
  so they completed his service.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> Then Simon came down, and lifted up his hands<br>
  over the whole congregation of the sons of Israel,<br>
  to pronounce the blessing of the Lord with his lips,<br>
  and to glory in his name;<br>
  <sup>21</sup> and they bowed down in worship a second time,<br>
  to receive the blessing from the Most High.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> And now bless the God of all,<br>
  who in every way does great things;<br>
  who exalts our days from birth,<br>
  and deals with us according to his mercy.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> May he give us gladness of heart,<br>
  and grant that peace may be in our days in Israel,<br>
  as in the days of old.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> May he entrust to us his mercy!<br>
  And let him deliver us in our days!<br>
  <sup>25</sup> With two nations my soul is vexed,<br>
  and the third is no nation:<br>
  <sup>26</sup> Those who live on Mount Seir, and the Philistines,<br>
  and the foolish people that dwell in Shechem.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> Instruction in understanding and knowledge<br>
  I have written in this book,<br>
  Jesus the son of Sirach, son of Eleazar, of Jerusalem,<br>
  who out of his heart poured forth wisdom.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> Blessed is he who concerns himself with these things,<br>
  and he who lays them to heart will become wise.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> For if he does them, he will be strong for all things,<br>
  for the light of the Lord is his path. </p><br><br>
  
  <h2>Chapter 51</h2>

  <p>
  <sup>1</sup> I will give thanks to thee, O Lord and King,<br>
  and will praise thee as God my Savior.<br>
  I give thanks to thy name,<br>
  <sup>2</sup> for thou hast been my protector and helper<br>
  and hast delivered my body from destruction<br>
  and from the snare of a slanderous tongue,<br>
  from lips that utter lies.<br>
  Before those who stood by<br>
  thou wast my helper,<br>
  <sup>3</sup> and didst deliver me,<br>
  in the greatness of thy mercy and of thy name,<br>
  from the gnashings of teeth about to devour me,<br>
  from the hand of those who sought my life,<br>
  from the many afflictions that I endured,<br>
  <sup>4</sup> from choking fire on every side<br>
  and from the midst of fire which I did not kindle,<br>
  <sup>5</sup> from the depths of the belly of Hades,<br>
  from an unclean tongue and lying words --<br>
  <sup>6</sup> the slander of an unrighteous tongue to the king.<br>
  My soul drew near to death,<br>
  and my life was very near to Hades beneath.<br>
  <sup>7</sup> They surrounded me on every side,<br>
  and there was no one to help me;<br>
  I looked for the assistance of men,<br>
  and there was none.<br>
  <sup>8</sup> Then I remembered thy mercy, O Lord,<br>
  and thy work from of old,<br>
  that thou dost deliver those who wait for thee<br>
  and dost save them from the hand of their enemies.<br>
  <sup>9</sup> And I sent up my supplication from the earth,<br>
  and prayed for deliverance from death.<br>
  <sup>10</sup> I appealed to the Lord, the Father of my lord,<br>
  not to forsake me in the days of affliction,<br>
  at the time when there is no help against the proud.<br>
  <sup>11</sup> I will praise thy name continually,<br>
  and will sing praise with thanksgiving.<br>
  My prayer was heard,<br>
  <sup>12</sup> for thou didst save me from destruction<br>
  and rescue me from an evil plight.<br>
  Therefore I will give thanks to thee and praise thee,<br>
  and I will bless the name of the Lord.<br>
  <sup>13</sup> While I was still young, before I went on my travels,<br>
  I sought wisdom openly in my prayer.<br>
  <sup>14</sup> Before the temple I asked for her,<br>
  and I will search for her to the last.<br>
  <sup>15</sup> From blossom to ripening grape<br>
  my heart delighted in her;<br>
  my foot entered upon the straight path;<br>
  from my youth I followed her steps.<br>
  <sup>16</sup> I inclined my ear a little and received her,<br>
  and I found for myself much instruction.<br>
  <sup>17</sup> I made progress therein;<br>
  to him who gives wisdom I will give glory.<br>
  <sup>18</sup> For I resolved to live according to wisdom,<br>
  and I was zealous for the good;<br>
  and I shall never be put to shame.<br>
  <sup>19</sup> My soul grappled with wisdom,<br>
  and in my conduct I was strict;<br>
  I spread out my hands to the heavens,<br>
  and lamented my ignorance of her.<br>
  <sup>20</sup> I directed my soul to her,<br>
  and through purification I found her.<br>
  I gained understanding with her from the first,<br>
  therefore I will not be forsaken.<br>
  <sup>21</sup> My heart was stirred to seek her,<br>
  therefore I have gained a good possession.<br>
  <sup>22</sup> The Lord gave me a tongue as my reward,<br>
  and I will praise him with it.<br>
  <sup>23</sup> Draw near to me, you who are untaught,<br>
  and lodge in my school.<br>
  <sup>24</sup> Why do you say you are lacking in these things,<br>
  and why are your souls very thirsty?<br>
  <sup>25</sup> I opened my mouth and said,<br>
  Get these things for yourselves without money.<br>
  <sup>26</sup> Put your neck under the yoke,<br>
  and let your souls receive instruction;<br>
  it is to be found close by.<br>
  <sup>27</sup> See with your eyes that I have labored little<br>
  and found myself much rest.<br>
  <sup>28</sup> Get instruction with a large sum of silver,<br>
  and you will gain by it much gold.<br>
  <sup>29</sup> May your soul rejoice in his mercy,<br>
  and may you not be put to shame when you praise him.<br>
  <sup>30</sup> Do your work before the appointed time,<br>
  and in God's time he will give you your reward.</p><br>
