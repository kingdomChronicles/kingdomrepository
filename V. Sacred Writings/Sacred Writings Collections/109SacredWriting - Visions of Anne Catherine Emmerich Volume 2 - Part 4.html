<p class="chapterTitle">From the Nativity of the Virgin Mary to the death of patriarch Saint Joseph</p>

 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">The Holy House of Nazareth</p>
                               

<p>
<sup>1</sup>The little house at Nazareth which Anne fitted up for Mary and Joseph, belonged to Anne. <br>
<sup>2</sup>From her own dwelling, she could, unnoticed, reach it in about half an hour by a cross path. <br>
<sup>3</sup>It lay not far from the gate. <br>
<sup>4</sup>It had a small courtyard in front and nearby was a well, a couple of steps leading down to it. <br>
<sup>5</sup>It was near a hill, but not built on it. <br>
<sup>6</sup>A narrow path dug out of the hill separated it from the back of the house, in which there was one little window. <br>
<sup>7</sup>It was darker on this side of the house than on the other. <br>
<sup>8</sup>The back part was triangular and built on higher ground than the front. <br>
<sup>9</sup>The foundations were cut in the rock; the upper part was a light masonry. <br>
<sup>10</sup>Mary’s sleeping com-partment was in the back, and there it was that the angelic Annunciation took place. <br>
<sup>11</sup>This chamber had a semicircular form, on account of the movable partitions placed around the walls and which were of coarser wickerwork than that ordinarily used for the light screens. <br>
<sup>12</sup>The patterns in which these screens were woven were similar to wafers, and the colors used were designed to bring the figures out. <br>
<sup>13</sup>Mary’s sleeping place was on the side just behind a wicker screen. <br>
<sup>14</sup>On the left was a little closet with a small table and stool. <br>
<sup>15</sup>This was the Blessed Virgin’s oratory.<br>
<sup>16</sup>This back room was separated from the rest of the house by a fireplace, which consisted of a graded wall from whose center over the slightly raised hearth, a chimney rose up to the roof and ended in a tube above it. <br>
<sup>17</sup>Over the opening through which the tube projected was built a little roof. <br>
<sup>18</sup>On top of the chimney, I saw in after years two little bells hanging. <br>
<sup>19</sup>To the right and left of the chimney and opening into Mary’s rooms were doors up to which three steps led. <br>
<sup>20</sup>In the chim-ney wall were all kinds of nooks in which stood the little vessels that I still see at Loretto. <br>
<sup>21</sup>Behind was a rafter of cedar wood, upon which the wall of the chimney rested. <br>
<sup>22</sup>From this upright rafter ran a crossbeam to the center of the back wall, and into this there were others dovetailed from the two side walls. <br>
<sup>23</sup>These beams were of a bluish cast with yellow ornaments. <br>
<sup>24</sup>Between them one could see up through the roof, which was hung with large leaves and matting, and in three places, namely in the three corners, adorned with stars. <br>
<sup>25</sup>The star in the middle corner was large like the morning star. <br>
<sup>26</sup>Later on the ceiling was adorned with numerous stars. <br>
<sup>27</sup>Over the horizontal rafter, which extended from the chimney to the back of the wall, was an opening in the center for the window, and under this was hung a lamp. <br>
<sup>28</sup>There was a rafter under the chimney also. <br>
<sup>29</sup>The roof was not high and pointed, but so level that one might walk around the edge. <br>
<sup>30</sup>It was flat on top, and there rose the chimney with its tubes, protected by the little roof.<br>
<sup>31</sup>When after Joseph’s death the Blessed Virgin removed to the neighborhood of Capharnaum, the Holy House was left beautifully adorned like a sacred shrine. <br>
<sup>32</sup>Mary often went from Capharnaum to visit the scene of the Incarnation and to pray there. <br>
<sup>33</sup>Peter and John, whenever they went to Palestine, visited the House of Nazareth and celebrated Mass in it. <br>
<sup>34</sup>An altar was erected where the fireplace used to be. <br>
<sup>35</sup>The little cupboard once used by Mary was placed as a tabernacle upon the altar.<br>
<sup>36</sup>I have often in vision witnessed the transporting of the Holy House to Loretto. <br>
<sup>37</sup>For a long time, I could not believe it, and yet I continued to see it. <br>
<sup>38</sup>I saw the Holy House borne over the sea by seven angels. <br>
<sup>39</sup>It had no foundation, but there was under it a shining surface of light. <br>
<sup>40</sup>On either side was something like a handle. <br>
<sup>41</sup>Three angels carried it on one side and three on the other; the seventh hovered in front of it, a long train of light after him.<br>
<sup>42</sup>I remember that it was the back of the house, the part that contained the fireplace, the altar of the Apostles, and the little window, that was transported to Europe. <br>
<sup>43</sup>It seems to me when I recall it that the rest of the building was in some danger of falling. <br>
<sup>44</sup>I see in Loretto the Crucifix also that the Blessed Virgin had when in Ephesus. <br>
<sup>45</sup>It was formed of different kinds of wood. <br>
<sup>46</sup>Later on, it came into the possession of the Apostles. <br>
<sup>47</sup>Many miracles take place before that Crucifix.<br>
<sup>48</sup>The wall of the Holy House of Loretto is entirely the original one. <br>
<sup>49</sup>Even the rafter under the chimney is still in its place. <br>
<sup>50</sup>The miraculous picture of the Mother of God stands on the altar of the Apostles.</p><br>

 


<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Mary’s Annunciation</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>On the day upon which the Church celebrates the feast, I had a vision of Mary’s Annunciation.<br>
<sup>2</sup>I saw the Blessed Virgin a short time after her marriage in the house of Nazareth.<br>
<sup>3</sup>Joseph was not there.<br>
<sup>4</sup>He was at that moment journeying with two beasts of burden on the road to Tiberias, whither he was going to get his tools.<br>
<sup>5</sup>But Anne was in the house with her maid and two of the virgins who had been with Mary in the Temple.<br>
<sup>6</sup>Everything in the house had been newly arranged by Anne.<br>
<sup>7</sup>Toward evening, they all prayed standing around a circular stool from which they afterward ate vegetables that had been served.<br>
<sup>8</sup>Anne seemed to be very busy about the household affairs, and for a time she moved around here and there, while the Blessed Virgin ascended the steps to her room.<br>
<sup>9</sup>There she put on a long, white, woolen garment, such as it was customary to wear during prayer, a girdle around her waist, and a yellowish-white veil over her head.<br>
<sup>10</sup>The maid entered, lighted the branched lamp, and retired.<br>
<sup>11</sup>Mary drew out a little, low table, which stood folded by the wall, and placed it in the center of the room.<br>
<sup>12</sup>It had a semicircular leaf, which could be raised on a movable support so that when ready for use the little table stood on three legs.<br>
<sup>13</sup>Mary spread upon it a red and then a white, transparent cover, which hung down on the side opposite the leaf.<br>
<sup>14</sup>It was fringed at the end and embroidered in the center.<br>
<sup>15</sup>A white cover was spread on the rounded edge.<br>
<sup>16</sup>When the little table was prepared, Mary laid a small, round cushion before it and, resting both hands on the leaf, she gently sank on her knees, her back turned to her couch, the door of the chamber to her right.<br>
<sup>17</sup>The floor was carpeted.<br>
<sup>18</sup>Mary lowered her veil over her face, and folded her hands, but not the fingers, upon her breast.<br>
<sup>19</sup>I saw her praying for a long time with intense fervor.<br>
<sup>20</sup>She prayed for Redemption, for the promised King, and that her own supplications might have some influence upon His coming.<br>
<sup>21</sup>She knelt long, as if in ecstasy, her face raised to Heaven; then she drooped her head upon her breast and thus continued her prayer.<br>
<sup>22</sup>And now she glanced to the right and beheld a radiant youth with flowing, yellow hair.<br>
<sup>23</sup>It was the archangel Gabriel.<br>
<sup>24</sup>His feet did not touch the ground.<br>
<sup>25</sup>In an oblique line and surrounded by an effulgence of light and glory, he came floating down to Mary.<br>
<sup>26</sup>The lamp grew dim, for the whole room was lighted up by the glory.<br>
<sup>27</sup>The angel, with hands gently raised before his breast, spoke to Mary.<br>
<sup>28</sup>I saw the words like letters of glittering light issuing from his lips.<br>
<sup>29</sup>Mary replied, but without looking up.<br>
<sup>30</sup>Then the angel again spoke and Mary, as if in obedience to his command, raised her veil a little, glanced at him, and said, “Behold the handmaid of the Lord.<br>
<sup>31</sup>May it be done unto me according to thy word!” I saw her now in deeper ecstasy.<br>
<sup>32</sup>The ceiling of the room vanished, and over the house appeared a luminous cloud with a pathway of light leading up from it to the opened heavens.<br>
<sup>33</sup>Far up in the source of this light, I beheld a vision of the Most Holy Trinity.<br>
<sup>34</sup>It was like a triangle of glory, and I thought that I saw therein the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.<br>
<sup>35</sup>As Mary uttered the words: “May it be done unto me according to thy word!” I saw an apparition of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<sup>36</sup>The countenance was human and the whole apparition environed by dazzling splendor, as if surrounded by wings.<br>
<sup>37</sup>From the breast and hands, I saw issuing three streams of light.<br>
<sup>38</sup>They penetrated the right side of the Blessed Virgin and united into one under her heart.<br>
<sup>39</sup>At that instant Mary became perfectly transparent and luminous.<br>
<sup>40</sup>It was as if opacity disappeared like darkness before that flood of light.<br>
<sup>41</sup>While the angel and with him the streams of glory vanished, I saw down the path of light that led up to Heaven, showers of half-blown roses and tiny green leaves falling upon Mary.<br>
<sup>42</sup>She, entirely absorbed in self, saw in herself the Incarnate Son of God, a tiny, human form of light with all the members, even to the little fingers perfect.<br>
<sup>43</sup>It was about midnight that I saw this mystery.<br>
<sup>44</sup>Some time elapsed, and then Anne and the other women entered Mary’s room, but when they beheld her in ecstasy they immediately withdrew.<br>
<sup>45</sup>The Blessed Virgin then arose, stepped to the little altar on the wall, let down the picture of a swathed child that was rolled above it, and prayed standing under the lamp before it.<br>
<sup>46</sup>Only toward morning did she lie down.<br>
<sup>47</sup>Mary was at this time a little over fourteen years old.<br>
<sup>48</sup>An intuitive knowledge of what had taken place was conferred upon Anne.<br>
<sup>49</sup>Mary knew that she had conceived the Redeemer, yes, her interior lay open before her, and so she already understood that her Son’s kingdom should be a supernatural one, and that the House of Jacob, the Church, would be the reunion of regenerate mankind.<br>
<sup>50</sup>She knew that the Redeemer would be the King of His people, that He would purify them and render them victorious; but that in order to redeem them He must suffer and die.<br>
<sup>51</sup>It was explained to me likewise why the Redeemer remained nine months in His mother’s womb, why He was born a little child and not a perfect man like Adam, and why also He did not take the beauty of Adam in Paradise.<br>
<sup>52</sup>The Incarnate Son of God willed to be conceived and born that conception and birth, rendered so very unholy by the Fall, might again become holy.<br>
<sup>53</sup>Mary was His Mother, and He did not come sooner because Mary was the first and the only woman conceived without sin.<br>
<sup>54</sup>Jesus when put to death was thirty-three years, four months, and two weeks old.<br>
<sup>55</sup>I thought all the while: Here in Nazareth, things are different from what they are in Jerusalem.<br>
<sup>56</sup>There the women dare not set foot in the Temple, but here in this church at Nazareth, a virgin is herself the Temple and the Most Holy rests in her.</p><br>



<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Mary’s Visitation</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>Mary’s Annunciation took place before Joseph’s return.<br>
<sup>2</sup>He had not yet settled at Nazareth when, with Mary, he started on the journey to Hebron.<br>
<sup>3</sup>After the Conception of Jesus, the Blessed Virgin experienced a great desire to visit her cousin Elizabeth.<br>
<sup>4</sup>I saw her travelling with Joseph toward the south.<br>
<sup>5</sup>Once I saw her passing the night in a hut made of wickerwork and which was all overrun with vines and beautiful white blossoms.<br>
<sup>6</sup>From that point to Zachary’s house, it was a journey of about twelve hours.<br>
<sup>7</sup>Near Jerusalem they turned off to the north in order to take a more solitary route.<br>
<sup>8</sup>They made the circuit of a little city two leagues from Emmaus, and took a road traversed by Jesus in after years.<br>
<sup>9</sup>Although it was a long journey, they made it very quickly.<br>
<sup>10</sup>They now had to cross two hills.<br>
<sup>11</sup>I saw them resting between them, eating some bread and refreshing themselves with some balsam drops which they had collected on the way, and which they mingled with their drinking water.<br>
<sup>12</sup>The hill was formed of overhanging rocks and caves.<br>
<sup>13</sup>The valleys were very fertile.<br>
<sup>14</sup>I remarked on the road one particular flower.<br>
<sup>15</sup>It had fine green leaves and a cluster of nine tiny bell-shaped blossoms, white, lightly flushed with red.<br>
<sup>16</sup>Mary wore a brown, woolen under dress over which was a gray one with a girdle, and a yellowish covering on her head.<br>
<sup>17</sup>Joseph carried in a bundle a long brownish garment with a cowl, and bands in front.<br>
<sup>18</sup>It was one that Mary was accustomed to wear whenever she went either to the Temple or the synagogue.<br>
<sup>19</sup>Zachary’s house stood upon a solitary hill, and other dwellings were scattered around.<br>
<sup>20</sup>Not far from it, a tolerably large brook flowed down from the mountain.<br>
<sup>21</sup>Elizabeth had learned in vision that one of her race was to give birth to the Messiah; she had dwelt in thought upon Mary, had very greatly desired to see her, and had indeed beheld her journeying to Hebron.<br>
<sup>22</sup>In a little room, to the right of the entrance to the house, she placed seats, and here she tarried, often looking long and anxiously down the road, in the hope of catching the first glimpse of Mary.<br>
<sup>23</sup>When Zachary was returning from the Passover, I saw Elizabeth, urged by an impetuous desire, hurrying from the house and going a considerable distance on the road to Jerusalem.<br>
<sup>24</sup>When Zachary met her, he was alarmed to find her so far from home and that, too, in her present condition.<br>
<sup>25</sup>But she told him of her anxiety and that she could not help thinking that her cousin Mary was corning from Nazareth to see her.<br>
<sup>26</sup>Zachary, however, thought it improbable that the newly married couple would at that time undertake so great a journey.<br>
<sup>27</sup>On the following day, I saw Elizabeth taking the road again under the influence of the same impression, and now I saw the Holy Family coming to meet her.<br>
<sup>28</sup>Elizabeth was advanced in years.<br>
<sup>29</sup>She was tall, her face small and delicate, and she wore something wrapped around her head.<br>
<sup>30</sup>She was acquainted with Mary only by hearsay.<br>
<sup>31</sup>As soon as the Blessed Virgin saw Elizabeth, she knew her and hurried on to meet her, while Joseph purposely held back.<br>
<sup>32</sup>Mary had already reached the houses in the neighborhood of Zachary’s home.<br>
<sup>33</sup>Their occupants were enraptured at her beauty, and filled with such reverence by her demeanor that they stood back modestly.<br>
<sup>34</sup>When the cousins met, they saluted each other joyfully with outstretched hands.<br>
<sup>35</sup>I saw a light in Mary and issuing from her a ray which entered into Elizabeth, who thereby became wonderfully agitated.<br>
<sup>36</sup>They did not pause long in sight of the beholders, but arm in arm passed up the courtyard to the door of the house, where Elizabeth once more bade Mary welcome.<br>
<sup>37</sup>Joseph went around to the side of the house and into an open hall where sat Zachary.<br>
<sup>38</sup>He respectfully saluted the aged priest, who responded in writing on his tablet.<br>
<sup>39</sup>Mary and Elizabeth entered the room in which was the fireplace.<br>
<sup>40</sup>Here they embraced, clasping each other in their arms and pressing cheek to cheek.<br>
<sup>41</sup>I saw light streaming down between them.<br>
<sup>42</sup>Then it was that Elizabeth, becoming interiorly inflamed, stepped back with uplifted hands, and exclaimed, “Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the Fruit of thy womb.<br>
<sup>43</sup>“And whence is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord should come to me?<br>
<sup>44</sup>“For behold, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.<br>
<sup>45</sup>“And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord.”<br>
<sup>46</sup>At these last words, Elizabeth took Mary into the little room prepared for her that she might sit down and rest.<br>
<sup>47</sup>It was only a few steps from where they then were.<br>
<sup>48</sup>Mary released her hold upon Elizabeth’s arm, crossed her hands on her breast, and divinely inspired, uttered her canticle of thanksgiving: “My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God, my Saviour.<br>
<sup>49</sup>“Because He hath regarded the humility of His handmaid; for behold from henceforth all genera-tions shall call me blessed.<br>
<sup>50</sup>“Because He that is mighty hath done great things to me: and holy is His name.<br>
<sup>51</sup>“And His mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that fear Him.<br>
<sup>52</sup>“He hath showed might in His arm: He hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.<br>
<sup>53</sup>“He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted the humble.<br>
<sup>54</sup>“He hath filled the hungry with good things: and the rich He hath sent empty away.<br>
<sup>55</sup>“He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of His mercy.<br>
<sup>56</sup>“As He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to His seed forever.<br>”
<sup>57</sup>I saw Elizabeth, moved by similar emotion, reciting the whole canticle with Mary.<br>
<sup>58</sup>Then they seated themselves on low seats.<br>
<sup>59</sup>A small goblet was on the little table.<br>
<sup>60</sup>And, oh, I was so happy! I sat nearby and prayed with them the whole time.<br>
<sup>61</sup>I saw Joseph and Zachary still together.<br>
<sup>62</sup>They were conversing by means of the tablet, and always about the coming of the Messiah.<br>
<sup>63</sup>Zachary was a tall, handsome old man clothed like a priest.<br>
<sup>64</sup>He and Joseph sat together at the side of the house that opened on the garden, in which Mary and Elizabeth were now sitting on a rug under a high, spreading tree.<br>
<sup>65</sup>Behind the tree was a fountain from which gushed water when a spigot was pressed.<br>
<sup>66</sup>I saw grass and flowers around, and trees bearing little, yellow plums.<br>
<sup>67</sup>Mary and Elizabeth were eating rolls and small fruits out of Joseph’s travelling pouch.<br>
<sup>68</sup>What touching simplicity and moderation! Two maids and two men servants were in the house.<br>
<sup>69</sup>They prepared a table under the tree.<br>
<sup>70</sup>Joseph and Zachary came out and ate something.<br>
<sup>71</sup>Joseph wanted to return home at once, but they persuaded him to stay eight days.<br>
<sup>72</sup>He knew not of Mary’s conception.<br>
<sup>73</sup>The women were silent on that subject.<br>
<sup>74</sup>They had a secret understanding together about their interior sentiments.<br>
<sup>75</sup>When all, Mary and Elizabeth, Joseph and Zachary, were together, they prayed making use of a kind of litany.<br>
<sup>76</sup>I saw a cross appear in their midst, and still there was no cross at that time.<br>
<sup>77</sup>Yes, it was as if two crosses visited each other.<br>
<sup>78</sup>In the evening they all sat together again in the garden near a lamp under the tree.<br>
<sup>79</sup>A cover like a tent was stretched under the tree, and low stools with backs stood around.<br>
<sup>80</sup>After that I saw Joseph and Zachary going to an oratory, while Mary and Elizabeth retired to their little chamber.<br>
<sup>81</sup>They were inflamed with divine ardor, and together they recited the Magnificat.<br>
<sup>82</sup>The Blessed Virgin wore a transparent white veil which she lowered when speaking to men.<br>
<sup>83</sup>Zachary took Joseph on the following day to another garden at some distance from the house.<br>
<sup>84</sup>He was in all things most exact and methodical.<br>
<sup>85</sup>This second garden was set out with beautiful bushes and trees full of fruit.<br>
<sup>86</sup>In the center was an avenue of trees, and at the end of it a small house whose entrance was on the side.<br>
<sup>87</sup>Above were openings with slides like windows.<br>
<sup>88</sup>A woven couch filled with moss or some other fine plant, stood in one room in which there were also two white figures as large as children.<br>
<sup>89</sup>I have no clear knowledge of how they came there nor what they signified, but they appeared to me to be very like Zachary and Elizabeth, only much younger.<br>
<sup>90</sup>I saw Mary and Elizabeth much together.<br>
<sup>91</sup>Mary helped with everything around the house and pre-pared all kinds of necessaries for the child.<br>
<sup>92</sup>Both she and Elizabeth knit on a large coverlet for the latter, and they worked also for the poor.<br>
<sup>93</sup>During Mary’s absence, Anne frequently sent her maid to see after Mary’s house at Nazareth, and once I saw her there herself.<br>
<sup>94</sup>I saw Zachary and Joseph spending the night of the next day in the garden at some distance from the house.<br>
<sup>95</sup>They slept part of the time in the little summer house, and prayed during the other part in the open air.<br>
<sup>96</sup>They returned quite early in the morning to the house where Mary and Elizabeth had passed the night.<br>
<sup>97</sup>Mary and Elizabeth recited together morning and evening the hymn of thanksgiving, the Magnificat, which Mary had received from the Holy Ghost at the salutation of Elizabeth.<br>
<sup>98</sup>During its recital they stood opposite each other against the wall, as if in choir, their hands crossed upon their breast, the black veil of each covering her face.<br>
<sup>99</sup>At the second part, which refers to God’s promise, I saw the previous history of the Most Holy Incarnation and the mystery of the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar, from Abraham down to Mary.<br>
<sup>100</sup>I saw Abraham sacrificing Isaac, also the Mystery of the Ark of the Covenant, which Moses received on the night before the departure from Egypt, and by which he was enabled to escape and conquer.<br>
<sup>101</sup>I recognized its connection with the holy Incarnation, and it seemed to me as if this Mystery were now fulfilled or living in Mary.<br>
<sup>102</sup>I saw also the Prophet Isaias and his prophecy of the Virgin, and from him to Mary visions of the approach of the Most Blessed Sacrament.<br>
<sup>103</sup>I still remember that I heard the words: “From father to father down to Mary, there are more than fourteen generations.”<br>
<sup>104</sup>I saw also Mary’s blood taking its rise in her ancestors and flowing nearer and nearer to the Incarnation.<br>
<sup>105</sup>I have no words to describe this clearly.<br>
<sup>106</sup>I can say only that I saw, sometimes here, sometimes there, the people of different races.<br>
<sup>107</sup>There seemed to issue from them a beam of light which always terminated in Mary as she appeared at that moment with Elizabeth.<br>
<sup>108</sup>I saw this beam issuing first from the Mystery of the Ark of the Covenant and ending in Mary.<br>
<sup>109</sup>Then I saw Abraham and from him a ray, which again ended in Mary, etc.<br>
<sup>110</sup>Abraham must have dwelt quite near to Mary’s abode at that time; for during the Magnificat I saw that the beam which proceeded from him came from no great distance, while those from persons nearer to the Mother of God in point of time seemed to come from afar.<br>
<sup>111</sup>Their rays were as fine, as clear as those of the sun when they shine through a narrow opening.<br>
<sup>112</sup>In such a beam, I beheld Mary’s blood glancing red and bright, and it was said to me: “Behold, as pure as this red light must the blood of that Virgin be from whom the Son of God will become incarnate.”<br>
<sup>113</sup>Once I saw Mary and Elizabeth going in the evening to Zachary’s country place.<br>
<sup>114</sup>They took with them rolls and fruit in little baskets, for they intended to stay overnight.<br>
<sup>115</sup>Joseph and Zachary followed them later.<br>
<sup>116</sup>I saw Mary going to meet them as they entered.<br>
<sup>117</sup>Zachary had brought his little tablet, but it was too dark for writing.<br>
<sup>118</sup>I saw Mary speaking to him.<br>
<sup>119</sup>She was telling him that he should speak on that night.<br>
<sup>120</sup>He laid aside his tablet and conversed orally with Joseph.<br>
<sup>121</sup>I saw all this to my own great astonishment.<br>
<sup>122</sup>Then my guide said to me: “Why, what is that?” and he showed me a vision of St.<br>
<sup>123</sup>Goar, who hung his mantle on the sunbeams as on a hook.<br>
<sup>124</sup>I received then the instruction that lively, childlike confidence makes all things real and substantial.<br>
<sup>125</sup>These two expressions gave me great interior light upon all kinds of miracles, but I cannot explain it.<br>
<sup>126</sup>They, Mary, Elizabeth, Joseph, and Zachary, all spent the night in the garden.<br>
<sup>127</sup>They sat or walked two by two, prayed now and then, or retired into the little summer house to rest.<br>
<sup>128</sup>I heard them say that Joseph would return home on the evening of the Sabbath, and that Zachary would go with him as far as Jerusalem.<br>
<sup>129</sup>The moon shone bright in a starry sky.<br>
<sup>130</sup>I t was indescribably calm and lovely near those holy souls.<br>
<sup>131</sup>Once also I had a peep into Mary’s little chamber.<br>
<sup>132</sup>It was night, and she was at rest.<br>
<sup>133</sup>She was lying on her side with one hand under her head.<br>
<sup>134</sup>Over her brown under-dress she wound from head to foot a strip of white, woolen stuff about an ell in width.<br>
<sup>135</sup>When preparing for rest, she took one end of this strip under her arm and wound it tightly around her head and the upper part of her person, then down to the feet and up again; so that she was entirely enveloped, and could not take a long step.<br>
<sup>136</sup>She did this near the couch, at the head of which was a little roll of something for a pillow.<br>
<sup>137</sup>The arms from the elbow down were left free, and the veiling of the head opened on the breast.<br>
<sup>138</sup>I often saw under Mary’s heart a glory in whose center burned an indescribably clear little flame, and over Elizabeth’s womb a similar glory, but the light in it was not so clear.<br>
<sup>139</sup>When the Sabbath began, I saw in Zachary’s house, in a room that I had not before seen, lamps lighted and the Sabbath celebrated.<br>
<sup>140</sup>Zachary, Joseph, and about six other men from the neighborhood were standing and praying under a lamp and around a little chest upon which lay rolls of writing.<br>
<sup>141</sup>They had on their heads something like a small veil.<br>
<sup>142</sup>They did not make so many distorted movements of the body as do the latter-day Jews, although like them they frequently bowed the head and raised the arms.<br>
<sup>143</sup>Mary, Elizabeth, and two other women stood apart in a grated partition from which they could see into the oratory.<br>
<sup>144</sup>They were entirely enveloped, their prayer mantles over their heads.<br>
<sup>145</sup>Zachary wore his festive robes the whole of the Sabbath.<br>
<sup>146</sup>They consisted of a long, white garment with rather narrow sleeves.<br>
<sup>147</sup>He was girdled with a broad cincture, wound many times around him.<br>
<sup>148</sup>On it were letters, and from it hung straps.<br>
<sup>149</sup>This garment was provided with a cowl, which hung in plaits from the head down the back like a folded veil.<br>
<sup>150</sup>When he moved or performed any action, he threw this garment rolled together with the ends of the girdle up over one shoulder, and stuck it into the girdle under his arm.<br>
<sup>151</sup>His lower limbs were loosely bound, and the strip enveloping them fastened by the straps that kept the soles in place upon his naked feet.<br>
<sup>152</sup>He showed his priestly mantle to Joseph.<br>
<sup>153</sup>It was sleeveless, wide and heavy and very beautiful, flashing with white and purple intermixed.<br>
<sup>154</sup>It was closed on the breast with three jeweled clasps.<br>
<sup>155</sup>When the Sabbath was over, I saw them eating again for the first time.<br>
<sup>156</sup>They took their repast together under the trees in the garden near the house.<br>
<sup>157</sup>They ate green leaves previously dipped into something, and sucked little bunches of herbs which too had been soaked.<br>
<sup>158</sup>There were little bowls of small fruits on the table and other dishes, from which they partook of something with brown, transparent spatulas.<br>
<sup>159</sup>It may have been honey that they were eating with horn spatulas.<br>
<sup>160</sup>There were also little rolls, and I saw them eating them.<br>
<sup>161</sup>After the meal, Joseph accompanied by Zachary started on his journey home.<br>
<sup>162</sup>The night was calm, the moon shining, and the sky studded with stars.<br>
<sup>163</sup>Before parting, all prayed separately.<br>
<sup>164</sup>Joseph took with him his little bundle in which were a few rolls and a small jug of something.<br>
<sup>165</sup>Both the travelers had staves; but Joseph’s was hooked on top, while Zachary’s was long and ended in a knob.<br>
<sup>166</sup>Both had travelling mantles which they wore over their head.<br>
<sup>167</sup>Before starting, they embraced Mary and Elizabeth, alternately pressing them to their heart.<br>
<sup>168</sup>But I saw no kissing at that time.<br>
<sup>169</sup>The parting was calm and cheerful.<br>
<sup>170</sup>The two women accompanied them a short distance, and then the travelers proceeded alone.<br>
<sup>171</sup>The night was unspeakably lovely.<br>
<sup>172</sup>Mary and Elizabeth now returned to the house and went into Mary’s chamber.<br>
<sup>173</sup>A lamp was burning upon a bracket on the wall, as was usual while Mary slept or prayed.<br>
<sup>174</sup>The two women stood facing each other, and recited the Magnificat.<br>
<sup>175</sup>They spent the whole night in prayer, for what reason I cannot now say.<br>
<sup>176</sup>Through the day I saw Mary busy with all kinds of work, weaving covers, for instance.<br>
<sup>177</sup>I saw Joseph and Zachary still on the road.<br>
<sup>178</sup>They spent the night under a shed.<br>
<sup>179</sup>They took very cir-cuitous roads and, I think, visited many people, for they were three days on their journey.<br>
<sup>180</sup>Again I saw Joseph at Nazareth.<br>
<sup>181</sup>Anne’s maid took charge of the house for him, going to and fro between the two houses.<br>
<sup>182</sup>With this exception, Joseph was entirely alone.<br>
<sup>183</sup>I also saw Zachary returning home, and I saw Mary and Elizabeth reciting as usual the Magnificat, and doing all kinds of work.<br>
<sup>184</sup>Toward evening, they used to walk in the garden.<br>
<sup>185</sup>There was a well in it, a rare occurrence in this part of the country; therefore travelers always took with them in a little jug some kind of juice to drink.<br>
<sup>186</sup>Sometimes also, and generally toward evening when it grew cool, Mary and Elizabeth walked some distance from the house, for it stood alone in the midst of fields.<br>
<sup>187</sup>They usually retired about nine o’clock, and always rose again before the sun.<br>
<sup>188</sup>The Blessed Virgin remained with Elizabeth three months, until after the birth of John, but she returned to Nazareth before his circumcision.<br>
<sup>189</sup>Joseph went to meet her halfway on the journey, and for the first time noticed that she was pregnant.<br>
<sup>190</sup>But he gave no sign of his knowledge, and struggled with his doubts.<br>
<sup>191</sup>Mary, who had feared this, was silent and preoccupied, thus increasing his uneasiness.<br>
<sup>192</sup>When arrived in Nazareth, Mary went to the parents of the deacon Parmenas and remained some days with them, Joseph’s anxiety had meanwhile increased to such a degree that, when Mary returned home, he determined to flee from the house.<br>
<sup>193</sup>Then the angel appeared to him and consoled him.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Feast Pictures</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>I saw a wonderful and almost indescribable vision of a feast. <br>
<sup>2</sup>I saw a church that looked like a slender, delicate, octangular fruit, the roots of whose stem touched the earth over a bubbling fountain. <br>
<sup>3</sup>The stem was not high, one could just see between the church and the earth. <br>
<sup>4</sup>The entrance was over the spring which bubbled and bubbled, casting out something white like earth or sand, and rendering all around green and fruitful. <br>
<sup>5</sup>There were no roots over the spring in front of the church. <br>
<sup>6</sup>The center of the interior was like the capsule in an apple, the cells formed of many delicate white threads. <br>
<sup>7</sup>In these cells were little organs like the kernels of an apple. <br>
<sup>8</sup>Through an opening in the floor, one could look straight down into the bubbling spring. <br>
<sup>9</sup>I saw some kernels that looked withered and decayed, falling into it. <br>
<sup>10</sup>But while I gazed, the fruit seemed to be developing more and more into a church; and the capsule at last appeared something like a piece of machinery, like a loose artificial nosegay in the center of it. <br>
<sup>11</sup>And now I saw the Blessed Virgin and Elizabeth standing on that nosegay and looking again like two tabernacles, the one the tabernacle of a saint, the other that of the Most Holy. <br>
<sup>12</sup>The two blessed women turned toward each other and offered mutual felicitations. <br>
<sup>13</sup>Then there issued from them two figures, Jesus and John. <br>
<sup>14</sup>John, the larger of the two, lay coiled on the earth, his head in his lap; but Jesus was like a tiny child formed of light, just as I so often see Him in the Blessed Sacrament. <br>
<sup>15</sup>Upright and hovering, He moved toward John and passed over him like a white vapor as he lay there with his face upon the earth. <br>
<sup>16</sup>The reflection from the snowy vapor glanced through the opening in the floor down into the spring, and by it was swallowed up. <br>
<sup>17</sup>Then Jesus raised the little John and embraced him, after which each returned to the womb of his mother, who meantime had been singing the Magnificat.<br>
<sup>18</sup>I saw also during that singing, Joseph and Zachary issuing from the walls on opposite sides of the church and followed by an ever-increasing flow of people, while the whole building continued unfolding, as it were, taking more and more the appearance of a church and the occasion that of a sacred festival. <br>
<sup>19</sup>Vines with luxuriant foliage were growing around the church, and they became so dense that they had to be trimmed.<br>
<sup>20</sup>The church now rested on the earth. <br>
<sup>21</sup>In it was an altar, and through an opening over the bubbling spring arose a baptismal font. <br>
<sup>22</sup>Many people entered by the door, and there was at last a grand and perfect festival. <br>
<sup>23</sup>All that took place therein, both in form and in action, was a silent growth. <br>
<sup>24</sup>I cannot relate all; words fail me.<br>
<sup>25</sup>On John’s feast, I had another vision of a festival. <br>
<sup>26</sup>The octangular church was transparent, as if formed of crystal or jets of water. <br>
<sup>27</sup>In the center was a well spring above which arose a little tower. <br>
<sup>28</sup>I saw John standing by it and baptizing. <br>
<sup>29</sup>The vision changed. <br>
<sup>30</sup>Out of the spring grew a flower stalk, around which arose eight pillars supporting a pyramidal crown. <br>
<sup>31</sup>Upon the crown stood the grandparents of Anne, Elizabeth, and Joseph; a little distant from the main stem were Mary and Joseph with the parents of the latter and those of Zachary. <br>
<sup>32</sup>Up on the central stem stood John. <br>
<sup>33</sup>A voice seemed to proceed from him, and I saw nations and kings entering the church and receiving the Blessed Eucharist from the hands of a Bishop. <br>
<sup>34</sup>I heard John saying that their happiness was greater than his.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Blessed Virgin’s Preparations for the Birth of Christ. Journey to Bethlehem</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>I saw the Blessed Virgin for many days with Anne, while Joseph remained alone in Nazareth, one of Anne’s maids taking charge of the house for him. <br>
<sup>2</sup>They, Mary and Joseph, received their principal support from Anne’s house as long as she lived. <br>
<sup>3</sup>I saw the Blessed Virgin near Anne sewing and embroidering bands and tapestry. <br>
<sup>4</sup>They seemed to be very busy in the house. <br>
<sup>5</sup>Joachim must long since have been dead, for I saw Anne’s second husband there and a little girl of from six to seven years old. <br>
<sup>6</sup>She was helping Mary and being taught by her. <br>
<sup>7</sup>If not a daughter of Anne, it must have been one of Mary Cleophas’s children also called Mary.<br>
<sup>8</sup>I saw Mary sitting in a room with other women and preparing covers large and small. <br>
<sup>9</sup>Some were embroidered with gold and silver. <br>
<sup>10</sup>There was one large coverlet in a box in the midst of the women, at which all were working, knitting with two little wooden needles and balls of colored wool. <br>
<sup>11</sup>Anne was very busy. <br>
<sup>12</sup>She went around from one to another, receiving and giving wool. <br>
<sup>13</sup>All expected Mary to be delivered in Anne’s house, and these covers and other things were being prepared partly for the birth of the Child and partly as gifts for the poor. <br>
<sup>14</sup>Everything was of the best, and all abundantly, and richly provided. <br>
<sup>15</sup>They knew not that Mary would, of necessity, have to journey to Bethlehem.<br>
<sup>16</sup>Joseph was at that moment on his way to Jerusalem with cattle for sacrifice.</p><br>



<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">John never received the Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>I saw Joseph returned from Jerusalem. He had taken thither cattle for sacrifice, and had put up at the house before the Bethlehem gate. <br>
<sup>2</sup>It was at this same inn that he and Mary stopped later on, before Mary’s Purification. <br>
<sup>3</sup>The keeper of the inn was an Essenian. <br>
<sup>4</sup>Joseph went from there to Bethlehem, but did not visit his relatives. <br>
<sup>5</sup>He was looking around after a place to build, also for some means of procuring lumber and tools, for in the spring after Mary’s delivery, which he thought would take place in Nazareth, he intended to remove with her to Bethlehem, as he did not care for Nazareth. <br>
<sup>6</sup>He wanted to get a place near the inn of the Essenian. <br>
<sup>7</sup>From Bethlehem he went again to Jerusalem, to offer sacrifice. <br>
<sup>8</sup>When he was returning from this journey to Jerusalem, and about midnight was crossing the field of Chimki, six hours from Nazareth, an angel appeared to him and said that he should set out at once with Mary for Bethlehem, as it was there that her Child was to be born. <br>
<sup>9</sup>The angel told him, moreover, that he should provide himself with a few necessaries, but no laces nor embroidered covers, and he mentioned all the other things he was to take. <br>
<sup>10</sup>Joseph was very much surprised. <br>
<sup>11</sup>He was told also that, besides the ass upon which Mary was to ride, he was to take with him a little she-ass of one year which had not yet foaled. <br>
<sup>12</sup>This little animal they were to let run at large, and then follow the road it would take.<br>
<sup>13</sup>I saw Joseph and Mary in their house at Nazareth; Anne too was present. <br>
<sup>14</sup>Joseph informed them of the commands he had received, and they began to prepare for the journey. <br>
<sup>15</sup>Anne was very much troubled about it. <br>
<sup>16</sup>The Blessed Virgin had had all along an interior admonition that she should bring forth her child in Bethlehem; but in her humility she had kept silence. <br>
<sup>17</sup>She knew it, also, from the Prophecies. <br>
<sup>18</sup>She had all the Prophecies referring to the birth of the Messiah in her little closet at Nazareth; she read them very often and prayed for their fulfillment. <br>
<sup>19</sup>She had received them from her teachers at the Temple, and by the same holy women had been instructed upon them. <br>
<sup>20</sup>Her prayer was always for the coming of the Messiah. <br>
<sup>21</sup>She esteemed her happy of whom the Child should be born, and she desired to serve her as her lowest handmaid. <br>
<sup>22</sup>In her humility, she had never conceived the thought that she herself was to be the one. <br>
<sup>23</sup>From those Prophecies she knew that the Saviour would be born in Bethlehem, therefore she lovingly submitted to the Divine Will and began her journey. <br>
<sup>24</sup>It was a very painful one for her, since at that season it was cold among the mountains. <br>
<sup>25</sup>Mary had an inexpressible feeling that henceforth she must and could be only poor. <br>
<sup>26</sup>She could possess no exterior goods, for she had all in herself. <br>
<sup>27</sup>She knew that she was to be the Mother of the Son of God. <br>
<sup>28</sup>She knew and she felt that, as by a woman sin had entered into the world, so now by a woman the Expiation was to be born. <br>
<sup>29</sup>It was under the influence of this feeling that she had exclaimed: “Behold the handmaid of the Lord!” I understood, likewise, that Jesus was conceived of the Holy Ghost about the hour of midnight, and about midnight should be born.<br>
<sup>30</sup>I saw Joseph and Mary with Anne, Mary Cleophas, and some servants silently setting out upon their journey. <br>
<sup>31</sup>They started from Anne’s. <br>
<sup>32</sup>An ass bore a comfortable cross-seat for Mary and her baggage. <br>
<sup>33</sup>On the field of Chimki, where the angel had appeared to Joseph, Anne had a pasture ground; and here the servants went to get the little she-ass of one year which Joseph had to take with him. <br>
<sup>34</sup>She ran after the Holy Family. <br>
<sup>35</sup>Anne, Mary Cleophas, and the servants now parted from Joseph and Mary after a touching leave-taking. <br>
<sup>36</sup>I saw the two travelers going some distance further and putting up at a house that lay on very high ground. <br>
<sup>37</sup>They were well received. <br>
<sup>38</sup>I think the proprietor was the lease holder of a farm called the House of Chimki and to which the field belonged. <br>
<sup>39</sup>From it one could see far into the distance, yes, even to the mountains near Jerusalem.<br>
<sup>40</sup>I again saw the Holy Family in a very cold valley, through which they were making their way toward a mountain. <br>
<sup>41</sup>The ground was covered with frost and snow. <br>
<sup>42</sup>It was about four hours from the House of Chimki. <br>
<sup>43</sup>Mary was suffering exceedingly from the cold. <br>
<sup>44</sup>She halted near a pine tree, and exclaimed: “We must rest. <br>
<sup>45</sup>I can go no farther.”<br>
<sup>46</sup> Joseph arranged a seat for her under the tree, in which he placed a light. <br>
<sup>47</sup>I often saw that done at night by travelers in those parts. <br>
<sup>48</sup>The Blessed Virgin prayed fervently, imploring God not to allow them to freeze; and at once so great a warmth passed into her that she stretched out her hands to St. <br>
<sup>49</sup>Joseph that he might warm himself by them. <br>
<sup>50</sup>She took some food to renew her strength. <br>
<sup>51</sup>The little ass, their guide, came up with them here and stood still. <br>
<sup>52</sup>The actions of the little animal were truly astonishing. <br>
<sup>53</sup>On straight roads, between mountains, for instance, where they could not go astray, she was sometimes behind, sometimes far ahead of them; but where the road branched, she was sure to make her appearance and run on the right way. <br>
<sup>54</sup>Whenever they reached a spot at which they should halt, the little creature stood still. <br>
<sup>55</sup>Joseph here spoke to Mary of the good lodgings that he expected to find in Bethlehem. <br>
<sup>56</sup>He told her that he knew the good people of an inn at which, for a moderate sum, they could get a comfortable room. <br>
<sup>57</sup>It was better, he said, to pay a little than to depend upon free quarters. <br>
<sup>58</sup>He praised Bethlehem in order to console and encourage her.<br>
<sup>59</sup>After that, I saw the Holy Family arrive at a large farmhouse, about two hours’ distance from the pine tree. <br>
<sup>60</sup>The woman was not at home, and the man refused St. <br>
<sup>61</sup>Joseph admittance, telling him that he might go on further. <br>
<sup>62</sup>On they went until they came to a shepherd’s shed where they found the little ass, and where they too halted. <br>
<sup>63</sup>There were some shepherds in it; but they soon vacated after showing themselves most friendly and supplying straw and faggots, or bundles of reeds for a fire. <br>
<sup>64</sup>The shepherds then went to the house from which Mary and Joseph had been sent away. <br>
<sup>65</sup>They mentioned having met them, and said: “What a beautiful, what an extraordinary woman! What an amiable, pious, benevolent man! What wonderful people those travelers are!” The man’s wife had now returned home, and she scolded at their having been sent away. <br>
<sup>66</sup>I saw her going to the shepherd’s hut at which they had put up, but she was timid and dared not enter. <br>
<sup>67</sup>This hut was on the north side of that mountain on whose southern declivity lay Samaria and Thebez. <br>
<sup>68</sup>Toward the east of this region and on this side of the Jordan, Salem and Ainon are situated, and on the oppo-site side, Socoth. <br>
<sup>69</sup>It was about twelve hours from Nazareth. <br>
<sup>70</sup>The woman came again with her two children. <br>
<sup>71</sup>She was quite friendly, and seemed to be very much touched by what she saw. <br>
<sup>72</sup>The husband also came and begged pardon. <br>
<sup>73</sup>After Mary and Joseph had refreshed themselves a little, he showed them to an inn about an hour further up the mountain.<br>
<sup>74</sup>The host, however, excused himself to Joseph, pleading the numbers already there. <br>
<sup>75</sup>But when the Blessed Virgin entered and begged for shelter, the wife of the innkeeper, as also the innkeeper himself, changed their bearing toward them. <br>
<sup>76</sup>The man at once arranged a shelter for them under a neighboring shed, and took charge of the ass. <br>
<sup>77</sup>The little she-ass was not with them. <br>
<sup>78</sup>She was running around the fields; for when not needed, she did not make her appearance. <br>
<sup>79</sup>This inn was a tolerably fine one, and consisted of several houses. <br>
<sup>80</sup>Although situated on the north side of the mountain, it was surrounded by orchards, pleasure gardens, and balsam trees. <br>
<sup>81</sup>Mary and Joseph remained overnight and the whole of the next day, for it was the Sabbath.<br>
<sup>82</sup>On the Sabbath the hostess with her three children visited Mary, also the woman of that other house with her two children. <br>
<sup>83</sup>Mary talked to the little ones and instructed them. <br>
<sup>84</sup>They had little rolls of parchment from which they read. <br>
<sup>85</sup>I, too, made bold to speak confidently to Mary. <br>
<sup>86</sup>She told me how extremely well it was with her in her present condition. <br>
<sup>87</sup>She felt no weight. <br>
<sup>88</sup>But sometimes, she experienced a sensation of being so immensely large internally and as if she were hovering in her own person. <br>
<sup>89</sup>She felt that she encompassed God and man, and that He whom she encompassed carried her.<br>
<sup>90</sup>Joseph went out with the host to his fields. <br>
<sup>91</sup>Both host and hostess had conceived great love for Mary; they sympathized with her condition. <br>
<sup>92</sup>They pressed her to remain, and showed her a room which they would give her. <br>
<sup>93</sup>But very early the next morning she started with Joseph on their journey. <br>
<sup>94</sup>They went forward, a little more to the east, along the mountain and into a valley, increasing the distance between them and Samaria to which they seemed at first to be going. <br>
<sup>95</sup>The temple upon Garizim was in sight. <br>
<sup>96</sup>On the roof were numerous figures like lions or other animals, which shone with a white light in the sun.<br>
<sup>97</sup>The road led down into a plain, or the field of Sichem. <br>
<sup>98</sup>After a journey of about six leagues, they came to a solitary farmhouse where they were made welcome. <br>
<sup>99</sup>The man was an overseer of fields and orchards belonging to a neighboring city. <br>
<sup>100</sup>It was warmer here and vegetation more luxuriant than at any place they had been, for it was the sunny side of the mountain, and that makes a great difference in Palestine at this season. <br>
<sup>101</sup>The house was not exactly in the valley, but on the southern declivity of the mountain which stretches from Samaria to the east. <br>
<sup>102</sup>The occupants belonged to those shepherds with whose daughters later on, the servants remaining behind from the caravan of the Three Kings had married. <br>
<sup>103</sup>In after years also Jesus often tarried here and taught. <br>
<sup>104</sup>Before departing, Joseph blessed the children of the family.<br>
<sup>105</sup>I saw him and Mary journeying over the plain beyond Sichem. <br>
<sup>106</sup>The Blessed Virgin sometimes went on foot. <br>
<sup>107</sup>They rested occasionally and refreshed themselves. <br>
<sup>108</sup>They had with them little rolls and a cool, strengthening drink in nice little jugs, brown and shining like metal. <br>
<sup>109</sup>The seat that Mary used on the ass was furnished with a pad on either side as a support for the limbs, which were thereby brought more into a sitting posture. <br>
<sup>110</sup>The support was over the neck of the ass, and Mary sat sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left. <br>
<sup>111</sup>Berries and other fruits were still hanging on the bushes and trees that were exposed to the sun, and these they gathered on the way. <br>
<sup>112</sup>The first thing that Joseph always did on arriving at an inn, was to prepare a comfortable seat or couch for Mary; then he washed his feet, as did Mary also. <br>
<sup>113</sup>Their ablutions were frequent.<br>
<sup>114</sup>It was quite dark one evening when they reached a lonely inn. <br>
<sup>115</sup>Joseph knocked and begged for shelter, but the owner would not open the door. <br>
<sup>116</sup>Joseph explained to him his position, telling him that his wife could go no farther. <br>
<sup>117</sup>But the man was inflexible; he would not interrupt his own rest. <br>
<sup>118</sup>And when Joseph told him that he would pay him, he received for answer: “This is not an inn, I will not have that knocking.”<br>
<sup>119</sup> The door remained closed. <br>
<sup>120</sup>Mary and Joseph went on for a short distance and found a shed. <br>
<sup>121</sup>He struck a light, and prepared a couch for Mary, she herself assisting him. <br>
<sup>122</sup>He brought the ass in, and found some straw and fodder for it. <br>
<sup>123</sup>Here they rested a few hours. <br>
<sup>124</sup>I saw them departing early the next morning while it was still dark. <br>
<sup>125</sup>They may now have been distant from their last halting place about six hours, about six and twenty from Nazareth, and ten from Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>126</sup>The last house stood on level ground, but the road from Gabatha to Jerusalem began again to grow steep. <br>
<sup>127</sup>Up to this time Mary and Joseph travelled no great highroads, though they crossed several commercial routes which ran from the Jordan to Samaria and to the roads that lead from Syria down into Egypt. <br>
<sup>128</sup>So far, the roads by which they came, with the exception of that single broad one, were very narrow and ran over the mountains. <br>
<sup>129</sup>One had to be very cautious in walking, but the ass could tread its way securely.<br>
<sup>130</sup>Now I saw the travelers arrive at a house whose owner was at first uncivil to Joseph. <br>
<sup>131</sup>He threw the light on Mary’s face, and twitted Joseph on having so young a wife. <br>
<sup>132</sup>But the man’s wife took them in, gave them shelter in an outhouse, and offered them some little rolls.<br>
<sup>133</sup>When they left this place, they next sought lodging in a large farmhouse where also they were not received in a manner especially cordial. <br>
<sup>134</sup>The innkeepers were young, and paid little heed to Mary and Joseph. <br>
<sup>135</sup>They were not simple shepherds, but rich farmers, such as we have here, mixed up with the world, with trade, etc. <br>
<sup>136</sup>I saw one old man going about the house with a walking stick. <br>
<sup>137</sup>From here they had still seven hours’ journey to Bethlehem, but they did not take the direct route thither, because it was mountainous and at this season too difficult. <br>
<sup>138</sup>They followed the little she-ass across the country between Jerusalem and the Jordan. <br>
<sup>139</sup>I saw them arrive about noon at a large shepherd’s house, about two hours from John’s place of baptism on the Jordan. <br>
<sup>140</sup>Jesus once passed a night there after His baptism. <br>
<sup>141</sup>Near the house was another for the farm and sheep utensils, and in the yard was a spring from which the water was conducted through pipes to the bathtubs. <br>
<sup>142</sup>There was a large public house here; and numbers of servants who took their meals at it were going and coming. <br>
<sup>143</sup>The host received the travelers very kindly and he was very obliging. <br>
<sup>144</sup>He insisted upon one of the servant’s washing Joseph’s feet at the spring. <br>
<sup>145</sup>He also supplied him with fresh garments while he aired and brushed those he took off. <br>
<sup>146</sup>A maidservant rendered the same services to Mary, for the mistress of the house was backward in making her appearance; she lived retired. <br>
<sup>147</sup>She is the same that Jesus afterward healed of a thirty years’ sickness. <br>
<sup>148</sup>He told her that her malady had come upon her as a punishment for her want of hospitality toward His relatives. <br>
<sup>149</sup>But I know the reason of her nonappearance to Mary and Joseph. <br>
<sup>150</sup>She was young and rather frivolous. <br>
<sup>151</sup>She had caught a glance of the Blessed Virgin, had spoken a word to her, perhaps, (I do not now recall all the circumstances) and had conceived a feeling of jealousy on account of her beauty. <br>
<sup>152</sup>It was for that reason that she kept herself secluded on this occasion. <br>
<sup>153</sup>There were some children in the hous<br>
<sup>154</sup>At their departure about noon, Mary and Joseph were accompanied part of the way by some of the people belonging to the inn. <br>
<sup>155</sup>They proceeded westward toward Bethlehem, and arrived after a journey of about two hours at a little village consisting of a long row of houses with gardens and courts lying on both sides of a broad highroad. <br>
<sup>156</sup>Joseph had connections here such as spring from the second marriage of a stepfather or stepmother. <br>
<sup>157</sup>Their house was finely situated and very handsome. <br>
<sup>158</sup>But Mary and Joseph did not enter. <br>
<sup>159</sup>They passed through the place and went straight on toward Jerusalem for half an hour, when they came to a public house in which a crowd was gathered for a funeral. <br>
<sup>160</sup>The frame partitions in the house had been removed from before the chim-ney and hearth. <br>
<sup>161</sup>The fireplace was draped with black, and before it rested a coffin enveloped in the same somber hue. <br>
<sup>162</sup>The male mourners wore long black robes with short, white ones over them and some had rough, black maniples on their arms. <br>
<sup>163</sup>All were praying. <br>
<sup>164</sup>In another apartment sat the women entirely enveloped in their large veils. <br>
<sup>165</sup>There was in the yard a large fountain with several faucets. <br>
<sup>166</sup>The proprietors of the house, who were taken up with the charge of the obsequies, left to the servants the duty of receiving Mary and Joseph. <br>
<sup>167</sup>This was done, accordingly, and the customary services rendered the holy travelers. <br>
<sup>168</sup>Tapestry, or mats, were let down from their rollers near the ceiling, and a curtained space arranged for them. <br>
<sup>169</sup>After some time, I saw the people of the house in conversation with them. <br>
<sup>170</sup>The white garments had been laid aside. <br>
<sup>171</sup>I saw a great many beds rolled up against the walls. <br>
<sup>172</sup>They could be entirely separated from one another by means of the mats let down from the ceilings. <br>
<sup>173</sup>Early the following morning, Mary and Joseph again started off. <br>
<sup>174</sup>The good wife of the house told them they might stay, because Mary appeared in hourly expectation of her delivery. <br>
<sup>175</sup>But Mary said with lowered veil that she had yet six or eight and thirty hours. <br>
<sup>176</sup>The woman was anxious to keep them, though not in her own house. <br>
<sup>177</sup>I saw the husband, as Joseph and Mary were departing, talking to the former about his beasts. <br>
<sup>178</sup>Joseph praised the ass very much, and told him that he had brought the other with him in case of necessity. <br>
<sup>179</sup>When the people spoke of the dif-ficulty of getting lodgings in Bethlehem, Joseph replied that he had friends there and that Mary and he would certainly be well received. <br>
<sup>180</sup>This made me feel so sorry. <br>
<sup>181</sup>Joseph always spoke of this with so much confidence. <br>
<sup>182</sup>I heard him again making the same remark to Mary on their way.<br>
<sup>183</sup>It so happened on the last days of the journey, when they were nearing Bethlehem, that Mary sighed longingly for rest and refreshment. <br>
<sup>184</sup>Joseph turned aside from the road for half an hour to a place where, upon a former occasion, he had discovered a beautiful fig tree laden with fruit. <br>
<sup>185</sup>It had seats around it for weary wayfarers to rest upon. <br>
<sup>186</sup>But when they reached it they found, to their great disappointment, that it was at that time quite destitute of fruit. <br>
<sup>187</sup>In after years something connected with Jesus happened near that tree. <br>
<sup>188</sup>It nevermore had fruit, though it continued green. <br>
<sup>189</sup>Jesus cursed it, and it withered.</p><br>
