            <h3>Col. 19</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup>I, Abraham built and alter (at Bethel) and called to god, praising him.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup>I then went to the Holy mountain and to Hebron<a href="#fn15">[15]</a> where he lived for two years. Because there was famine in the land my family and I traveled to Egypt where grain was plentiful.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup>I went across the branches of the Nile<a href="#fn16">[16]</a> to enter Egypt, the land of the sons of Ham.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup>I had a dream about a cedar tree and a date-palm tree. When people came to cut down the cedar tree, the date-palm tree objected, saying that they were grown from a single root. </p>
            <p><sup>5</sup>The cedar tree was spared.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup>I became fearful of the dream and told it to my wife.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup>I explained it as it pertained to us telling Sarah that the men will come for her and try to kill me.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup>I warned Sarah that she must tell everyone that I am her brother so that my life can be spared.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup>She became scared and did not want to go to Zoan for fear of being seen.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup>Five years later<a href="#fn17">[17]</a>, councilors of the Egyptians court and advisors of the Pharaoh of Zoan<a href="#fn18">[18]</a> came, having heard the words of my wife.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup>They brought gifts and requested knowledge from me. I read to them from the Book of the words of Enoch.</p>
            


            <h3>Col. 20<small><a href="#fn19">[19]</a></small></h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup>The men return to the Pharaoh and describe Sarah's features: beautiful face, supple hair, lovely eyes, pleasant nose, radiant face<a href="#fn20">[20]</a>.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup>He continued on describing her shapely breasts, perfect hands, and everything down to her long and delicate fingers.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup>the men compared her to and rated her far higher than virgins and birds, and all other women alike.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup>Hearing this, and then seeing Sarah, the pharaoh wanted her and took her for his wife.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup>Sarah saved me by telling the pharaoh that I was her brother and that night I and my nephew Lot cried together I prayed to Lord for justice<a href="#fn21">[21]</a>. </p>
            <p><sup>6</sup>I wanted the Lord to raise up against the pharaoh and protect Sarah. </p>
            <p><sup>7</sup>God listened and sent an evil spirit to the entire household that prevented the pharaoh from having sexual relations with Sarah for the two years that they were together.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup>At the end of the two years, the plagues and afflictions were so great that magicians and healers were sent for.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup>They were, of course, ineffective, and they all soon left.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup>Hyrcanos went to me pleading for help against the plague because I had been seen in a dream.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup>I agreed to help only when my wife Sarah is returned to me.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup>The pharaoh heard this and confronted me, himself asking why I lied saying that Sarah was my sister.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup>He agreed to give Sarah back and I exorcised the evil spirit from the house of the pharaoh.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup>The pharaoh swore to me that he had not touched Sarah while they were together and gave her gifts of gold, silver, linen, and purple-dyed clothing.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup>Sarah and I were then led out of Egypt.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup>I, Sarah, Lot, and his wife took our flocks and the gold and silver I had received<a href="#fn22">[22]</a> and traveled together.</p>
            
              

            <h3>Col. 21</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup>I went to all my old campsites until I reached Bethel, the place where I once built an alter, and then I built another one and offered up burnt offerings and a cereal offerings to the God Of Most High, and invoked the name of the Lord of the Universe there.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup>I praised God's name and blessed god and gave thanks to Him there for all the flocks and goods and wealth which he has given me, for the good he has done for me, and because He had returned me to this land safely.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this day, Lot left me on the account of our shepherd's behavior.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup>He went to live in the Valley of Jordan taking all his flocks with him. And I also added greatly to what he had. </p>
            <p><sup>5</sup>he pastured his flock and kept moving until he reached Sodom<a href="#fn23">[23]</a> and bought a house there, while I still lived in the mountain of Bethel.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup>It bothered me that Lot and I had separated.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God came to me in a dream and said to me: Go up to Ramat Hazor<a href="#fn24">[24]</a> which is north of Bethel, the place you are living now, and look to the east, west, south and to the north.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup>Look at the land which I am giving you and your descendants forever.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup>The next morning I went up to Ramat Hazor and looked at the land from that height, from the river of Egypt up to Lebanon and Senir<a href="#fn25">[25]</a>, and from the Great Sea up to Hauran<a href="#fn26">[26]</a>, and all the land of Gebel<a href="#fn27">[27]</a> to Qadesh<a href="#fn28">[28]</a>, and all the Great Desert<a href="#fn29">[29]</a>, as far as the Euphrates and he said to me:</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup>I shall give all this land to your descendants; and they will inherit it forever.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup>I will multiply your descendants like the dust of the earth that none can count.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup>Your descendants will be numberless.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup>Arise, walk about, go "see how long and how wide it is, for I will give it to you and to your descendants after you, forever.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I, Abraham, went out traveling in a circuit to survey the land.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup>I began the circuit at the Gihion River<a href="#fn30">[30]</a>, I went along the Mediterranean Sea until I reached the Mountain of the Bull<a href="#fn31">[31]</a>.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup>I circled from the coast of this great river saltwater sea, skirting the Mount of the Bull, and continued eastward through the breadth of the and until I came to the Euphrates river.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup>I traveled along the Euphrates until I reached the red sea in the east, whence I followed the coast of the Red Sea until I came to the branch of the Reed Sea<a href="#fn32">[32]</a>, jutting out from the Red Sea.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup>From there I completed the circuit, moving southward to arrive at Gihon River.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup>Then I returned home safely and found all is well with my men.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup>Then I went and settled next to the oaks of Mamre<a href="#fn33">[33]</a>, which is northeast of Hebron.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup>There I built an alter and offered up burnt offering and a cereal offering to the God Most High.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup>I ate and drank there, I and all the men of my household, and invited Mamre, Arnem, and Eshkol, three Amorite brothers and my friends.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup>They ate and drank together with me. </p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> Prior to those days Chedorlaomer, the king of Elam, Amraphel, the king of Babylon, Arioch, the king of Cappadocia<a href="#fn34">[34]</a>, and Tidal, the king of Goiim<a href="#fn35">[35]</a>, which lies between the two rivers had come. </p>
            <p><sup>25</sup>They had waged war on Bera, the king of Sodom, Birsha, the king of Gomorrah, Shinab, the king of Admah, Shemiabad, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup>All these formed an alliance to do battle in the Valley of Siddim.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup>Now the king of Elam, and the kings with him proved to be stronger than the king of Sodom and imposed tribute upon them.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup>Over twelve years they continued paying their tribute to the king of Elam, but in the thirteenth they rebelled against him.</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup>Thus the fourteenth year the king of Elam sallied forth with all his allies, and they ascended by the way of the desert<a href="#fn36">[36]</a>.</p>
            <p><sup>30</sup>They smote and plundered beginning from the Euphrates.</p>
            <p><sup>31</sup>They kept on smiting-smiting the Rephaim who were in the Asteroth-Kernaim<a href="#fn37">[37]</a>, the Zumzammin who were Amman, the Emim<a href="#fn">[38]</a> who were in Shaveh-hakerioth, and the Horites who were in the mountain of Gebal-until they reached El- Paran, in the desert.</p>
            <p><sup>32</sup>They returned...in Hazazon-tamar<a href="#fn39">[39]</a>. The king of Sodom went out to meet him, together with the king of Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim and the king of Bela.</p>
            <p><sup>33</sup>They engaged in battle in the valley of Siddim against Chedorlaomer, and allies that were with him. The king of Sodom was defeated and put to flight while the king of Gomorrah fell into the pits...</p>
            <p><sup>34</sup>The king Elam plundered all the property of Sodom and of Gomorrah and they captured Lot.</p>
                     

                    
              <h3>Footnotes</h3>
              
              <a name="fn1">[1]</a> The columns numbers differ between sources. This is because recent research has shown that the 1Q20 fragments comprise column 1 and 2 but are not after included with this work.<br>
              <a name="fn2">[2]</a> Lamech believes that his wife Bitenosh has been with fallen angels called Watchers or Nephilim.  He fears his child may be a Giant because of this union with the Watcher.<br>
              <a name="fn3">[3]</a> Most High, Great Lord, King of the Universe are all referring to God; the names make God appear even more powerful and mighty.<br>
              <a name="fn4">[4]</a> This column contains the beginning of Enoch's reply to Methuselah.  He starts talking about how in the days of Jared, angels descended to take human wives.<br>
              <a name="fn5">[5]</a> There are  very few sources where this column's context is explained.  Many  sources attempt  to 
              hypothesize what the text is trying to get across but an agreement has yet to be established.  The main thrust of this 
              text is that Noah, after being born with  the  gift of knowing the truth, lived his life righteously, married, and married his children off.  Finally this passage ends with Noah having a vision. <br>
              <a name="fn6">[6]</a> These are the activities that occur immediately after the flood.<br>
              <a name="fn7">[7]</a> Mountain of Ararat<br>
              <a name="fn8">[8]</a> Noah's grandsons were Arpachsad, Gomer, Magog, Madai, Yavan, Tubal, Mosok, and Tiras.  Others were born, as well as granddaughters, but their names are not mentioned.<br>
              <a name="fn9">[9]</a> This column is not found in many sources and no explanations are given beyond the text.  It is unclear who "they" and the significance of the olive tree.  Columns 14 and 15 also have no further explanation.<br>
              <a name="fn10">[10]</a> Part of the branch possibly got entangled with<br>
              <a name="fn11">[11]</a> This passage presents the idea that Noah had been dreaming in columns 13,14,15 after he came down from the mountain.<br>
              <a name="fn12">[12]</a> Noah's firstborn grandson.<br>
              <a name="fn13">[13]</a> Son of Japhet.<br>
              <a name="fn14">[14]</a> Another son of Japhet.<br>
              <a name="fn15">[15]</a> In the bible it only states that Abraham set out, continuing on his way to Negeb with no mention of Hebron.  Hebron is a town older than any other in the country-approximately 2300 years old.<br>
              <a name="fn16">[16]</a> Carmon is the branch mentioned but it is controversial whether the translation from Greek gives an actual branch of the Nile or not.<br>
              <a name="fn17">[17]</a> As with all Biblical writings, the mention of time periods is controversial.  five years is not an exact time period.<br>
              <a name="fn18">[18]</a> Zoan is the old Testament name for Tanis, a town in Egypt.<br>
              <a name="fn19">[19]</a> The descriptions of Sarah's beauty provide many details that writers of the scroll believed were locking in the Old Testament.<br>
              <a name="fn20">[20]</a> This can be literally taken as "all the bloom" of her face.  It suggests Sarah's god given beauty that cannot be taken away.<br>
              <a name="fn21">[21]</a> Biblical accounts do not include Abraham's praying to God.<br>
              <a name="fn22">[22]</a> This is actually interpreted incorrectly. The gifts were given to Sarah by the Pharaoh, and Abraham's wealth was independent of these gifts.<br>
              <a name="fn23">[23]</a> located in the Jordan Valley but unfortunately, no other information is given.<br>
              <a name="fn24">[24]</a> it is the highest spot in the mountains of Judea, which gives Abraham an unique view of the land.<br>
              <a name="fn25">[25]</a> Mt. Hermon which is the southern tip of the Anti-Lebanon range. <br>
              <a name="fn26">[26]</a>  it is a broad,  high plateau that is southeast of Mt. Hermon..<br>
              <a name="fn27">[27]</a> it is the land south of the Dead Sea.<br>
              <a name="fn28">[28]</a> associated with the Gebel, it is southeast of the Dead Sea.<br>
              <a name="fn29">[29]</a> the desert between Egypt and Palestine.<br>
              <a name="fn30">[30]</a>  it is associated with the Nile River and it is undoubtedly the same as the "River of Egypt".<br>
              <a name="fn31">[31]</a> it is part of the Taurus mountain range called Mount Amanus, situated north of Alexandretta. <br>
              <a name="fn32">[32]</a> Tongue-shaped gulf of the Suez.<br>
              <a name="fn33">[33]</a> Are oak trees belonging to Mamre, the Amorite that is later mentioned in this text.  Abraham settles near the oak of Ogyges.<br>
              <a name="fn34">[34]</a> kingdom located in Asia Minor.<br>
              <a name="fn35">[35]</a> A place in the Mesopotamia.<br>
              <a name="fn36">[36]</a> Syrian Desert.<br>
              <a name="fn37">[37]</a> Ashteroh is found east of Jordan.<br>
              <a name="fn38">[38]</a> Inhabitant  of the ancient land of Moab.<br>
              <a name="fn39">[39]</a> Situated somewhere in the southern area of the Dead Sea.<br>
