<p class="chapterTitle">From the Nativity of the Virgin Mary to the death of patriarch Saint Joseph</p>

 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">The Second Day of the Kings At the Crib. Their Departure</p>
                               

<p>
<sup>1</sup>On the next day, the Kings again visited the Crib Cave separately. <br>
<sup>2</sup>During the whole day, I saw much given away by them, especially to the shepherds out in the field where the beasts had been sheltered. <br>
<sup>3</sup>I saw poor old women bent with age going around with mantles over their shoulders given them by the Kings’ generosity. <br>
<sup>4</sup>I saw crowds of Jews from Bethlehem thronging around the good people, trying by every means in their power to extort presents from them, and looking through all that they had with a design to cheat. <br>
<sup>5</sup>I saw the Kings freeing several of their people who wanted to remain among the shepherds. <br>
<sup>6</sup>They gave them some of the beasts of burden with all kinds of covers and vessels packed on them, also golden grains, or gold dust, and they parted from them most cordially. <br>
<sup>7</sup>I know not why their number was so diminished; perhaps many went away, or were sent home the preceding night.<br>
<sup>8</sup>There was also a quantity of bread given away. <br>
<sup>9</sup>I do not know where they got so much, but true it is that they had it. <br>
<sup>10</sup>They were accustomed to bake wherever they encamped. <br>
<sup>11</sup>I think they must already have received a warning to diminish their luggage as much as possible on their return journey.<br>
<sup>12</sup>That evening I saw the Kings in the Crib Cave, taking leave. <br>
<sup>13</sup>Mensor entered first alone, and the Blessed Virgin gave him the Child in his arms. <br>
<sup>14</sup>He shed abundant tears, and his face was beaming with joy. <br>
<sup>15</sup>Then followed the others and took leave with many tears. <br>
<sup>16</sup>They again offered numerous gifts: a great roll of precious stuff; pieces of silk, some whitish, others red; also flowered stuffs, and many very fine covers. <br>
<sup>17</sup>They left their large mantles also with the Holy Family. <br>
<sup>18</sup>They were fine wool of a pale delicate color, and so light that they floated on the breeze. <br>
<sup>19</sup>They brought also numerous dishes piled one above the other, boxes of grain, and a basket full of pots containing delicate green plants bearing tiny leaves and white blossoms. <br>
<sup>20</sup>About three of these small pots stood in the middle of a larger one; still another could have found room between them and the rim of the large pot. <br>
<sup>21</sup>They were arranged in the basket, one above the other. <br>
<sup>22</sup>There were also long, narrow baskets containing birds, such as I had seen hanging on the dromedaries, and which they used for food. <br>
<sup>23</sup>They all wept much when parting from the Child and Mary. <br>
<sup>24</sup>I saw the Blessed Virgin standing by them when they took their leave. <br>
<sup>25</sup>The Kings’ gifts were received by Mary and Joseph with touching humility and sincere thanks to the donors, but without any manifestations of pleasure. <br>
<sup>26</sup>During the whole of this wonderful visit, I never saw in Mary the least shadow of self-interest. <br>
<sup>27</sup>In her love for the Child Jesus and compassion for St. <br>
<sup>28</sup>Joseph, she thought that the possession of these treasures would, perhaps, prevent their being treated in Bethlehem with such contempt as had been shown them upon their arrival, for Joseph’s trouble and mortification on that account had been to her a source of suffering.<br>
<sup>29</sup>Lamps were already lighted in the Crib Cave, when the Kings took leave. <br>
<sup>30</sup>They went out behind the hill toward the east, to the field in which were their people and beasts. <br>
<sup>31</sup>In it stood a high tree whose spreading boughs shaded a wide circumference. <br>
<sup>32</sup>The tree was very old and had a legend of its own, for Abraham and Melchisedech had met under its branches. <br>
<sup>33</sup>The shepherds and the people around regarded it as sacred. <br>
<sup>34</sup>A spring gushed up before it, the waters of which the shepherds used at certain seasons on account of their healing qualities. <br>
<sup>35</sup>There was near the tree a furnace which could be covered, and at both sides huts affording shelter at night. <br>
<sup>36</sup>A hedge surrounded the whole tract. <br>
<sup>37</sup>Thither went the Kings, and found all the followers still remaining to them gathered together. <br>
<sup>38</sup>A light was suspended from the tree, and under it they prayed, and sang with indescribable sweetness.<br>
<sup>39</sup>Joseph entertained the Kings again in the tent by the Crib, and then they and their nobles returned to their inn at Bethlehem. <br>
<sup>40</sup>Meanwhile, the governor of the city, (acting on a secret order from Herod or moved by a spirit of officiousness, I know not) had resolved to arrest the Kings then in Bethlehem, and accuse them to Herod as disturbers of the peace. <br>
<sup>41</sup>I know not when he was going to execute his resolve, but to the Kings that night in Bethlehem and to their followers in their tents near the Crib, an angel appeared in sleep, warning them to depart forthwith and to hasten home by another way. <br>
<sup>42</sup>Those in the tents immediately awakened Joseph, and told him the order just received. <br>
<sup>43</sup>While they proceeded to arouse the whole encampment and order the tents to be taken down, which was done with incredible speed, Joseph hurried off to Bethlehem to announce it to the Kings. <br>
<sup>44</sup>But they, leaving most of their baggage behind them, had already started from the city. <br>
<sup>45</sup>Joseph met them on the way and told them his errand. <br>
<sup>46</sup>They informed him that they, too, had received similar instructions from an angel. <br>
<sup>47</sup>Their hurried departure was unnoticed in Bethlehem. <br>
<sup>48</sup>Issuing forth quietly and without their baggage, an observer might have concluded that they were going to their people, perhaps for prayer. <br>
<sup>49</sup>While they were still in the Cave, weeping and taking leave, their followers were already starting in separate bands in order to be able to travel more quickly, and were hurrying to the south, by a route different from that by which they had come, through the desert of Engaddi along the Dead Sea.<br>
<sup>50</sup>The Kings implored the Holy Family to flee with them. <br>
<sup>51</sup>On their refusal, they begged Mary at least to conceal herself with Jesus in the Suckling Cave, that she might not on their account be molested.<br>
<sup>52</sup>They left many things to St. <br>
<sup>53</sup>Joseph to give away. <br>
<sup>54</sup>The Blessed Virgin, taking the veil from her head, bestowed it upon them. <br>
<sup>55</sup>She had been accustomed to envelope the Infant Jesus in its folds when holding Him in her arms. <br>
<sup>56</sup>The Kings still held the Child in their arms. <br>
<sup>57</sup>They were shedding tears and uttering most touching words. <br>
<sup>58</sup>At last they gave their light silk mantles to Mary, mounted their dromedaries, and hurried away. <br>
<sup>59</sup>I saw the angel by them in the field, pointing out the way they should take. <br>
<sup>60</sup>The caravan was now much smaller, and the beasts but lightly burdened. <br>
<sup>61</sup>Each King rode at about a quarter of an hour’s distance from the others. <br>
<sup>62</sup>They seemed to have vanished all on a sudden. <br>
<sup>63</sup>They met again in a little city, and then rode forward less rapidly than they had done on leaving Bethlehem. <br>
<sup>64</sup>I always saw the angel going on before them, and sometimes speaking with them.<br>
<sup>65</sup>Mary, wrapping the Child Jesus in her mantle, at once withdrew to the Suckling Cave. <br>
<sup>66</sup>The gifts of the Kings and all that they had left, were also taken thither by the shepherds who had tarried around the encampment in the valley. <br>
<sup>67</sup>The Kings’ people who had preferred to remain behind their masters lent a helping hand.<br>
<sup>68</sup>The three oldest of the shepherds, who had been the first to do homage to Jesus, received very rich presents from the Kings. <br>
<sup>69</sup>When it was discovered in Bethlehem that the caravan had departed, the travelers were already near Engaddi, and the valley in which they had encamped was, with the exception of some tent poles left standing and the footprints in the grass, lonely and still as before.<br>
<sup>70</sup>The appearance of the royal caravan had caused great excitement in Bethlehem. <br>
<sup>71</sup>Many now regretted that they had refused lodgings to Joseph; some spoke of the Kings and their followers as of a swarm of adventurers, while others connected their advent with the accounts they had heard of the wonderful apparitions to the shepherds. <br>
<sup>72</sup>I saw from the city hall a proclamation made to the assembled citizens; viz.,<br>
<sup>73</sup>that they should beware of all preposterous opinions and superstitious reports, and go no more to the abode of those people outside the city.<br>
<sup>74</sup>When the crowd had dispersed, I saw Joseph at two different times conducted to the city hall. <br>
<sup>75</sup>The second time, he took with him some of the gifts of the Kings, which he presented to the old Jews who had taken him to task, and he was set at liberty. <br>
<sup>76</sup>There was another way leading from the city to the neighborhood of the Crib Cave, not by the city gate, but from that place where Mary, on the evening of her arrival with Joseph in Bethlehem, had rested under the tree while waiting for Joseph to find a lodging. <br>
<sup>77</sup>This point of egress I saw the Jews blocking up with a fallen tree. <br>
<sup>78</sup>They also erected a watch house with a bell from which was a rope stretched across the road. <br>
<sup>79</sup>Thus anyone trying to go that way would soon be discovered.<br>
<sup>80</sup>I saw also about sixteen soldiers with Joseph at the Crib Cave. <br>
<sup>81</sup>But when they found besides himself only Mary and the Child, they returned to the city to report.<br>
<sup>82</sup>Joseph had carefully concealed the royal gifts. <br>
<sup>83</sup>There were other caves in the hill under that of the Crib. <br>
<sup>84</sup>No one knew of them but Joseph, who had discovered them long ago in his boyhood. <br>
<sup>85</sup>They had existed from the time of Jacob who, when Bethlehem counted only a couple of huts, had there a tent with his followers.<br>
<sup>86</sup>The gifts of the Kings, the woven stuffs, the mantles, the golden vessels—all after the Resurrection were consecrated to religious uses. <br>
<sup>87</sup>Each King had three light mantles and one, thick and heavy, for bad weather. <br>
<sup>88</sup>The thin ones were of very fine wool, yellow and red mixed, and so light that they floated on the breeze as the wearers moved along. <br>
<sup>89</sup>On festive occasions, they were exchanged for mantles of silk; they were not dyed, but of the original, lustrous shade. <br>
<sup>90</sup>The train was embroidered around the edge with gold, and it was so long that it had to be carried. <br>
<sup>91</sup>I had also a vision of the raising of silkworms. <br>
<sup>92</sup>In a region between the country of Seir and Theokeno, I saw trees full of silkworms. <br>
<sup>93</sup>Every tree was surrounded by a little ditch of water, in order to prevent the worms from crawling away. <br>
<sup>94</sup>Fodder was scattered under the trees, and from their branches hung little boxes. <br>
<sup>95</sup>Out of these boxes the weavers took chrysalides, about a finger in length, from which they wound off a web like that of a spider. <br>
<sup>96</sup>They fastened a number of these chrysalides before the breast, and spun from them a fine thread which they rolled on a piece of wood provided with a hook. <br>
<sup>97</sup>I saw the silk weavers among the trees at their looms, which were very simple. <br>
<sup>98</sup>The strips of stuff woven were as wide, perhaps, as my bed.</p><br>

 


<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Return of St. Anne</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>After the departure of the Kings, the Holy Family went over into the other cave, and I saw the Crib Cave quite empty, the ass alone still standing there. <br>
<sup>2</sup>Everything, even the hearth, had been cleared away. <br>
<sup>3</sup>I saw Mary peaceful and happy in her new abode which had been arranged somewhat comfortably. <br>
<sup>4</sup>Her couch was near the wall and by her rested the Child Jesus in an oval basket made of broad strips of bark. <br>
<sup>5</sup>The upper end of the basket, where the head of the Infant Jesus lay, was arched over with a cover. <br>
<sup>6</sup>The basket itself stood on a woven partition, before which Mary sometimes sat with the Child beside her. <br>
<sup>7</sup>Joseph had a separate space at a little distance. <br>
<sup>8</sup>Above the movable partition, there projected from the wall a pole to which a lamp was suspended. <br>
<sup>9</sup>I saw Joseph bringing in a pitcher of water and something in a dish. <br>
<sup>10</sup>But he did not go any more to Bethlehem for necessaries; the shepherds brought him all that he needed.<br>
<sup>11</sup>And now I saw Zachary coming for the first time from Hebron to visit the Holy Family. <br>
<sup>12</sup>He wept for joy as he held the Child in his arms, and recited, with some little changes, the canticle of thanksgiving that he had uttered at John’s circumcision. <br>
<sup>13</sup>He spent the following day with Joseph, and then took his departure.<br>
<sup>14</sup>Many persons going up to Bethlehem for the Sabbath called also at the Crib Cave; but when they no longer found Mary there, they went on to the city.<br>
<sup>15</sup>Anne now came back to the Mother of God. <br>
<sup>16</sup>She had been eight days with her youngest sister, who had married into the tribe of Benjamin. <br>
<sup>17</sup>She lived about three hour’s distance from Bethlehem, and had several sons who later became disciples of Jesus; among them was the bridegroom of Cana. <br>
<sup>18</sup>Anne’s eldest daughter was with her. <br>
<sup>19</sup>She was taller than Anne and looked almost as old. <br>
<sup>20</sup>Anne’s second husband also was with her. <br>
<sup>21</sup>He was older and taller than Joachim, was named Eliud, and was engaged at the Temple where he had something to do with the cattle intended for sacrifice. <br>
<sup>22</sup>Anne had a daughter by this marriage, and she, too, was called Mary. <br>
<sup>23</sup>At the time of Christ’s birth, the child may have been from six to eight years old. <br>
<sup>24</sup>By her third husband, Anne had a son, who was known as the brother of Christ. <br>
<sup>25</sup>There is a mystery connected with Anne’s repeated marriages. <br>
<sup>26</sup>She entered into them in obedience to the divine command. <br>
<sup>27</sup>The grace by which she had become fruitful with Mary had not yet been exhausted. <br>
<sup>28</sup>It was as if a blessing had to be consumed.<br>
<sup>29</sup>Mary told Anne all about the Kings, and she was very much touched at God’s bringing those men so far to adore the Child. <br>
<sup>30</sup>She was filled with emotion on seeing their gifts, upon which she looked as expressions of their adoration. <br>
<sup>31</sup>She helped to arrange and pack them, and she also gave many of them away. <br>
<sup>32</sup>Anne’s maid was still with Mary. <br>
<sup>33</sup>When in the Crib Cave, she stayed in the little cellar-like cave to the left, and now she slept under a shed that Joseph had put up for her just in front of their present abode. <br>
<sup>34</sup>Anne and her daughters slept in the Crib Cave. <br>
<sup>35</sup>I saw that Mary let Anne take care of the Child Jesus, a favor she had not granted to anyone else. <br>
<sup>36</sup>I saw something that very much affected me. <br>
<sup>37</sup>The hair of the Infant Jesus, which was yellow and crisp, ended in very fine rays of light which glistened and sparkled through one another. <br>
<sup>38</sup>I think they curled the Child’s hair, for they twisted it over the little head when they washed it. <br>
<sup>39</sup>Then they put a little cloak around Him. <br>
<sup>40</sup>I always saw Mary, Joseph, and Anne full of devout emotion for the Child Jesus; but their expression of it was quite unaffected and simple, as is always the case among holy, chosen souls. <br>
<sup>41</sup>The Child displayed a love in turning toward Its Mother such as is by no means usual in young children. <br>
<sup>42</sup>Anne was so happy when she was nursing the Child. <br>
<sup>43</sup>Mary always laid It in her arms.<br>
<sup>44</sup>The King’s gifts were now hidden in the cave in which Mary had taken up her abode. <br>
<sup>45</sup>They were in a wicker chest placed in a recess of the wall and perfectly concealed from sight.<br>
<sup>46</sup>Anne’s husband with her daughters and maid soon returned home, taking with them many of the royal gifts. <br>
<sup>47</sup>Anne was now all alone with Mary and Joseph, and she remained until Eliud and the maid came back. <br>
<sup>48</sup>I saw her and Mary weaving or embroidering covers. <br>
<sup>49</sup>She slept in the cave with Mary, but separate.<br>
<sup>50</sup>There were again in Bethlehem, soldiers seeking in many houses after the king’s son newly-born. <br>
<sup>51</sup>They especially importuned with their questions a noble Jewish lady who was in childbed, but they went no more to the Crib Cave. <br>
<sup>52</sup>It was now reported that only a poor, Jewish family had been there, but of them nothing more could be learned. <br>
<sup>53</sup>Two of the old shepherds went to Joseph (two of those that had first gone to the Crib) and warned him of what was going on in Bethlehem. <br>
<sup>54</sup>Then I saw Joseph, Mary, and Anne with the Child Jesus making their way from the cave to the tomb under that large cedar tree beneath which I had heard the Kings singing one evening. <br>
<sup>55</sup>It was distant from the cave about seven and a half minutes. <br>
<sup>56</sup>The tree stood upon a hill at the foot of which was an obliquely lying door opening into a passage that led to a perpendicular door which closed the entrance to the tomb. <br>
<sup>57</sup>The shepherds often stayed in the forepart of it. <br>
<sup>58</sup>In front of the tomb was a spring. <br>
<sup>59</sup>The tomb cave itself was not square, but rather rounded in form. <br>
<sup>60</sup>At the upper end, which was somewhat broader, something like a scalloped stone coffin stood on heavy supports upon a foundation of stone; one could see between it and the coffin. <br>
<sup>61</sup>The interior of the cave was of soft, white stone. <br>
<sup>62</sup>I saw the Holy Family entering it by night with a covered light. <br>
<sup>63</sup>In the cave that they had vacated nothing now was to be seen which could attract notice. <br>
<sup>64</sup>The beds had been rolled up and taken away, as well as all their household effects. <br>
<sup>65</sup>It looked like an abandoned dwelling place. <br>
<sup>66</sup>Anne carried the Child in her arms, Joseph and Mary at her side, while the shepherds led the way as guides. <br>
<sup>67</sup>And now I had a vision, but I do not know whether it was seen by the Holy Family or not. <br>
<sup>68</sup>I saw around the Child Jesus in the arms of Anne a glory made up of seven angelic figures entwined together and leaning one upon the other. <br>
<sup>69</sup>There were, besides, many other figures in this aureola, and on either side of Anne, of Joseph, and of Mary, I saw figures of light supported by them, held up, as it were, under the arms.1<br>
<sup>70</sup>Passing through the first entrance, they shut it and went on into the interior of the tomb cave.<br>
<sup>71</sup>A couple of days before Anne’s return home, I saw some shepherds entering the tomb cave and speaking to Mary; they told her that government officials were corning to seek her Child. <br>
<sup>72</sup>Joseph hurried off with the Child Jesus wrapped in his mantle, and I saw Mary, for half a day perhaps, sitting in the cave very anxious and without the Child.<br>
<sup>73</sup>When Eliud with Anne’s maid carne again from Nazareth to take Anne home, I saw a very beauti-ful ceremony celebrated in the Crib Cave. <br>
<sup>74</sup>Joseph had taken advantage of Mary’s withdrawal to the tomb cave, and with the help of the shepherds had adorned the whole interior of the Crib Cave. <br>
<sup>75</sup>It was festooned with flower garlands, both walls and roof, and in the center stood a table. <br>
<sup>76</sup>All the beautiful carpets and stuffs of the Kings that had not yet been removed, were spread over the floor and hung in festoons from the walls. <br>
<sup>77</sup>A cover was spread on the table, and on it was placed a pyramid of flowers and foliage that reached to the opening in the roof. <br>
<sup>78</sup>On top of the pyramid hovered a dove. <br>
<sup>79</sup>The whole cave was full of light and splendor. <br>
<sup>80</sup>The Child Jesus in His little basket cradle was placed upon a stool on the table. <br>
<sup>81</sup>He sat upright as He had done on the lap of His Mother at the adoration of the Kings. <br>
<sup>82</sup>Joseph and Mary were standing on either side of Him. <br>
<sup>83</sup>They were adorned with wreaths, and they drank something out of a glass. <br>
<sup>84</sup>I saw choirs of angels in the cave. <br>
<sup>85</sup>All were very happy and full of emotion. <br>
<sup>86</sup>It was the anniversary of Joseph and Mary’s espousals.<br>
<sup>87</sup>When the celebration was over, I saw Anne and Eliud going away and taking with them on two asses what still remained of the Kings’ gifts.<br>
<sup>88</sup>The Holy Family immediately set about preparing for their own departure. <br>
<sup>89</sup>Their household effects had steadily diminished. <br>
<sup>90</sup>The portable partitions and other pieces of furniture made by Joseph were now bestowed upon the shepherds, who removed them at once.<br>
<sup>91</sup>I saw the Blessed Virgin going twice by night to the Crib Cave with the Child Jesus, and laying It on a carpet on the spot upon which It was born. <br>
<sup>92</sup>Then she knelt down at Its side and prayed. <br>
<sup>93</sup>I saw the whole cave filled with light as at the moment of the Birth. <br>
<sup>94</sup>It was now entirely cleared out, for Anne on reaching home had dispatched two of her servants to get whatever the Holy Family would not need on their journey. <br>
<sup>95</sup>I saw them returning with the two asses on which they rode laden with goods. <br>
<sup>96</sup>The cave to which the Holy Family had removed, as well as the Crib Cave, were now quite empty; they had also been swept out, for Joseph wanted to leave everything perfectly clean.<br>
<sup>97</sup>On the night preceding their departure for the Temple, I saw Mary and Joseph taking formal leave of the Crib Cave. <br>
<sup>98</sup>They spread the deep red cover of the Kings first over that spot upon which the Child Jesus was born, laid the Child on it, and kneeling beside It prayed. <br>
<sup>99</sup>Then they laid the Child in the Crib and again prayed beside It; and, lastly, on the place where It had been circumcised where, too, they knelt in prayer. <br>
<sup>100</sup>Joseph had caused the young she ass to be pawned among his relatives, for he was still resolved to return to Bethlehem and build himself a house in the valley of the shepherds. <br>
<sup>101</sup>He had mentioned his intention to the shepherds, saying that he would take Mary for awhile to her mother, that she might recover from the hardships undergone in her late abode. <br>
<sup>102</sup>He left all kinds of things with them.</p><br>



<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Mary’s Purification</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>Before the break of day, Mary seated herself on the ass, the Child Jesus on her lap. <br>
<sup>2</sup>She had only a couple of covers and one bundle. <br>
<sup>3</sup>She sat upon a side seat that had a little footboard. <br>
<sup>4</sup>They started to the left around the Crib hill and off by the east side of Bethlehem unperceived by anyone.<br>
<sup>5</sup>I saw them at midday resting at a spring that was roofed in and surrounded by seats. <br>
<sup>6</sup>A couple of women came out here to Mary, bringing to her little mugs and rolls.<br>
<sup>7</sup>The offering that the Holy Family had with them was hanging in a basket on the ass. <br>
<sup>8</sup>The basket had three compartments; two contained fruit, and in the third, which was of open wickerwork, were doves. <br>
<sup>9</sup>Toward evening, when about a quarter of an hour’s distance from Jerusalem, they turned and entered a small house that lay next a large inn. <br>
<sup>10</sup>The owners were a married couple without children, and by them the holy travelers were welcomed with extraordinary joy. <br>
<sup>11</sup>The house lay between the brook Cedron and the city. <br>
<sup>12</sup>I saw Anne’s man servant and the maid stopping with these people on their journey home, at which time also they engaged quarters for the Holy Family. <br>
<sup>13</sup>The husband was a gardener; he clipped the hedges and kept the road in order. <br>
<sup>14</sup>The wife was a relative of Johanna Chusa. <br>
<sup>15</sup>They appeared to me to be Essenians.<br>
<sup>16</sup>The whole of the next day, I still saw the Holy Family with the old people outside Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>17</sup>The Blessed Virgin was almost all the time alone in her room with the Child which lay upon a low, covered projection of the wall. <br>
<sup>18</sup>She was always in prayer, and appeared to be preparing herself for the sacrifice. <br>
<sup>19</sup>I received at that moment an interior instruction as to how we should prepare for the Holy Sacrifice. <br>
<sup>20</sup>I saw in her room myriads of angels adoring the Child Jesus. <br>
<sup>21</sup>Mary was wholly absorbed in her own interior. <br>
<sup>22</sup>The old people did out of pure love all they could for the Mother of God. <br>
<sup>23</sup>They must have had some presentiment of the Child’s holiness.<br>
<sup>24</sup>I had a vision also of the priest Simeon. <br>
<sup>25</sup>He was a very aged, emaciated man with a short beard. <br>
<sup>26</sup>He had a wife and three grown sons, the youngest of whom was already twenty years old. <br>
<sup>27</sup>Simeon dwelt at the Temple. <br>
<sup>28</sup>I saw him going through a narrow, dark passage in the wall of the Temple to a little cell which was built in the thick walls. <br>
<sup>29</sup>It had only one opening, from which he could look down into the Temple. <br>
<sup>30</sup>Here I saw the old man kneeling and praying in ecstasy. <br>
<sup>31</sup>The apparition of an angel appeared before him, telling him to notice particularly the first Child that would, early the next morning, be brought for presentation, for that It was the Messiah whom he had now awaited so long. <br>
<sup>32</sup>The angel added that, after seeing the Child, he would die. <br>
<sup>33</sup>Oh, what a beautiful sight that was to me! The little cell was so bright, and the old man radiant with joy! He went home full of gladness, announced to his wife the good tidings of the angel, and then returned to his prayer. <br>
<sup>34</sup>I have seen that the pious priests and Israelites of those times did not sway to and fro so much when at prayer as the Jews of our days; but I saw them scourging themselves. <br>
<sup>35</sup>Anna in her Temple cell was also rapt in prayer; and she, too, had a vision.<br>
<sup>36</sup>Early in the morning while it was still quite dark, I saw the Holy Family accompanied by the two old people going into the city and to the Temple. <br>
<sup>37</sup>The ass was laden as if for a journey, and they had with them the basket of offerings. <br>
<sup>38</sup>They first entered a court that was surrounded by a wall, and there the ass was tied under a shed. <br>
<sup>39</sup>The Blessed Virgin and Child were received by an old woman and conducted along a covered walk up to the Temple. <br>
<sup>40</sup>The old woman carried a light, for it was still dark. <br>
<sup>41</sup>Here in this passage came Simeon full of expectation to meet Mary. <br>
<sup>42</sup>He spoke a few joyous words with her, took the Child Jesus, pressed Him to his heart, and then hurried to another side of the Temple. <br>
<sup>43</sup>Since the preceding evening, when he had received the announcement of the angel, he had been consumed by desire. <br>
<sup>44</sup>He had taken his stand in the women’s passage to the Temple, hardly able to await the coming of Mary and her Child.<br>
<sup>45</sup>Mary was now led by the woman to a porch in that part of the Temple in which the ceremony of presentation was to take place. <br>
<sup>46</sup>Anna and another woman (Noemi, Mary’s former directress) received her. <br>
<sup>47</sup>Simeon came out to the porch and conducted Mary with the Child in her arms into the hall to the right of the women’s porch. <br>
<sup>48</sup>It was in this porch that the treasure box stood by which Jesus was sitting when the widow cast in her mite. <br>
<sup>49</sup>Old Anna, to whom Joseph had handed over the basket of fruit and doves, followed with Noemi, and Joseph retired to the standing place of the men.<br>
<sup>50</sup>It was understood at the Temple that several women were coming today to offer sacrifice, and preparations had been made accordingly. <br>
<sup>51</sup>Numerous pyramidal lamps were burning round the walls, the little flames rising out of a disk supported upon an arm in the form of an arch, which shone almost as brightly as the light itself. <br>
<sup>52</sup>On the disk hung extinguishers which, when struck together above the flame, put it out. <br>
<sup>53</sup>Before the altar, from whose corners projected horns, was placed a chest, the doors of which opened outward and afforded supports for a tolerably large slab, the whole forming a table. <br>
<sup>54</sup>This surface was covered first with a red cloth and over that a white transparent one, both of which fell to the floor. <br>
<sup>55</sup>On the four corners burned lamps with several branches; in the center of the table was a cradle-shaped basket, and near it two oval dishes and two small baskets. <br>
<sup>56</sup>All these objects, as also the priests’ vestments, which were lying on the horned altar, were kept in the chest whose open doors formed the table. <br>
<sup>57</sup>A railing enclosed the whole. <br>
<sup>58</sup>On both sides of this hall were rows of seats in tiers where priests were sitting in prayer.<br>
<sup>59</sup>Simeon conducted Mary through the altar rail and up to the table of sacrifice. <br>
<sup>60</sup>The Infant Jesus, wrapped in His sky-blue dress, was laid in the basket cradle. <br>
<sup>61</sup>Mary wore a sky-blue dress, a white veil, and a long, yellowish mantle. <br>
<sup>62</sup>When the Child had been placed in the cradle, Simeon led Mary out again to the standing place of the women. <br>
<sup>63</sup>He then proceeded to the altar proper, whereon lay the priestly vestments and at which, besides himself, three other priests were vesting. <br>
<sup>64</sup>And now one of them went behind, one before, and two on either side of the table, and prayed over the Child, while Anna approached Mary, gave her the doves and fruit in two little baskets, one on top of the other, and went with her to the altar rail. <br>
<sup>65</sup>Anna remained there while Mary, led again by Sim-eon, passed on through the railing and up to the altar. <br>
<sup>66</sup>There upon one of the dishes she deposited the fruit, and into the other laid some coins; the doves she placed upon the table in the basket. <br>
<sup>67</sup>Simeon stood before the table near Mary while the priest behind it took the Child from the cradle, raised It on high and toward the different parts of the Temple, praying all the while. <br>
<sup>68</sup>Simeon next received the Child from him, laid It in Mary’s arms, and, from a roll of parchment that lay near him on a desk, prayed over her and the Child.<br>
<sup>69</sup>After that Simeon again led Mary to the railing, whence Anna accompanied her to the place set apart for the women. <br>
<sup>70</sup>In the meantime, about twenty mothers with their firstborn had arrived. <br>
<sup>71</sup>Joseph and several others were standing back in the place assigned to the men.<br>
<sup>72</sup>Then two priests at the altar proper began a religious service accompanied by incense and prayers, while those in the rows of seats swayed to and fro a little, but not like the Jews of the present day.<br>
<sup>73</sup>When these ceremonies were ended, Simeon went to where Mary was standing, took the Child into his arms and, entranced with joy, spoke long and loud. <br>
<sup>74</sup>When he ceased, Anna also filled with the Spirit, spoke a long time. <br>
<sup>75</sup>I saw that the people around heard them indeed, but it caused no interruption to the other ceremonies. <br>
<sup>76</sup>Such praying aloud appeared not to be unusual. <br>
<sup>77</sup>But all were deeply impressed, and regarded Mary and the Child with great reverence. <br>
<sup>78</sup>Mary shone like a rose. <br>
<sup>79</sup>Her public offerings were indeed the poorest; but Joseph in private gave to Simeon and to Anna many little, yellow, triangular pieces to be employed for the use of the Temple, and chiefly for the maidens belonging to it who were too poor to meet their own expenses. <br>
<sup>80</sup>It was not everyone that could have his children reared in the Temple. <br>
<sup>81</sup>Once I saw a boy in Anna’s care. <br>
<sup>82</sup>I think he was the son of a prince, or king, but I have forgotten his name.<br>
<sup>83</sup>I did not witness the purification ceremonies of the other mothers; but I had an interior conviction that all the children offered on that day would receive special grace, and that some of the martyred innocents were among them. <br>
<sup>84</sup>When the Most Holy Child Jesus was laid upon the altar in the basket cradle, an indescribable light filled the Temple. <br>
<sup>85</sup>I saw that God was in that light, and I saw the heavens open up as far as the Most Holy Trinity.<br>
<sup>86</sup>Mary was now led back into the court by Anna and Noemi. <br>
<sup>87</sup>Here she took leave of them, and was joined by Joseph and the old people with whom she and Joseph had lodged. <br>
<sup>88</sup>They went with the ass straight out of Jerusalem, and the good, old people accompanied them a part of the way. <br>
<sup>89</sup>They reached Bethoron the same day, and stayed overnight in the house which had been Mary’s last stopping place on her journey to the Temple thirteen years before. <br>
<sup>90</sup>Here some of Anne’s people were waiting to conduct them home.</p><br>




<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Feast Picture</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>I saw the festival of the Purification celebrated also in the spiritual church. <br>
<sup>2</sup>It was filled with angelic choirs and in the center above them, I saw the Most Holy Trinity and in It something like a void. <br>
<sup>3</sup>In the middle of the church stood an altar and on it a tree with broad, pendent leaves, similar to the trees in Paradise by which Adam fell.<br>
<sup>4</sup>I saw the Blessed Virgin with the Child Jesus in her arms floating up from the earth to the altar, while the tree on the same inclined low before her and began to wither. <br>
<sup>5</sup>A magnificent angel in priestly garments, a halo round his head, approached Mary. <br>
<sup>6</sup>She gave him the Child, and he laid It upon the altar. <br>
<sup>7</sup>At that instant I saw the Most Holy Trinity as ever before in Its fullness. <br>
<sup>8</sup>I saw the angel give to Mary a little shining ball whereon was the figure of a swathed Child, and I saw her with this gift hovering over the altar. <br>
<sup>9</sup>From all sides, I saw crowds of poor people approaching Mary with lights. <br>
<sup>10</sup>She reached those lights to the Child on the ball into which they seemed to pass, and then to reappear. <br>
<sup>11</sup>I saw that all these lights united into one, which spread over Mary and the Child, and illumined all things. <br>
<sup>12</sup>Mary had extended her wide mantle over the whole earth. <br>
<sup>13</sup>And now there was a festival.<br>
<sup>14</sup>I think that the withering of the Tree of Knowledge at Mary’s appearance and the offering of the Child to the Most Holy Trinity signified the reuniting of the human race with God, and through Mary those scattered lights became one light in the light of Jesus, and illumined all things.</p><br>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Death of Holy Simeon</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>I saw that Simeon, after prophesying in the Temple, returned home and fell sick. <br>
<sup>2</sup>I saw him on his couch giving his last advice to his wife and sons, and imparting to them his joy. <br>
<sup>3</sup>Then I saw him die. <br>
<sup>4</sup>There were several old Jews and priests praying around him.<br>
<sup>5</sup>When he had breathed his last, they carried the body into another room where, without stripping it, it was washed. <br>
<sup>6</sup>The body was laid on a board pierced with holes, under which was a copper basin to receive the water as it fell. <br>
<sup>7</sup>A large sheet was thrown over the corpse, and under that the washing was performed. <br>
<sup>8</sup>Green leaves and herbs were then strewn plentifully over it and a wide cloth bound firmly around it, as is done in the swathing of a child. <br>
<sup>9</sup>The corpse was so stiff and straight that I was tempted to think it was bound to a board. <br>
<sup>10</sup>The burial took place in the evening. <br>
<sup>11</sup>Six men with lights carried the corpse on a board with low, curved sides to the sepulcher hewn in a hill not far from the Temple. <br>
<sup>12</sup>It was entered through an oblique door; the interior walls were ornamented with stars and various figures like the Blessed Virgin’s cell at the Temple. <br>
<sup>13</sup>I noticed the same kind of ornamentation in St. <br>
<sup>14</sup>Benedict’s first cloister. <br>
<sup>15</sup>The corpse was deposited in the center of the little cave, the passage around it being left free; then some religious rites were solemnized. <br>
<sup>16</sup>They laid all kinds of things around the corpse: coins and little stones and leaves, I think. <br>
<sup>17</sup>I do not now remember all distinctly. <br>
<sup>18</sup>Simeon was related to Veronica and, through his father, with Zachary also. <br>
<sup>19</sup>His sons served in the Temple, and were always, though in secret, on terms of friendship with Jesus and His relatives. <br>
<sup>20</sup>Some of them before and some after the Ascension of Our Lord, joined the disciples. <br>
<sup>21</sup>At the time of the first persecution they did much for the Community.</p><br>





<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Return of the Holy Family to Nazareth</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>I saw the Holy Family returning to Nazareth by a much more direct route than that by which they had gone to Bethlehem. <br>
<sup>2</sup>On their first journey, they had shunned the inhabited districts and seldom put up at an inn; but now they took the straight route, which was much shorter.<br>
<sup>3</sup>Joseph had in his cloak pocket some little rolls of thin, yellow, shining leaves on which were letters. <br>
<sup>4</sup>He had received them from the Holy Kings. <br>
<sup>5</sup>The shekels of Judas were thicker, and in the form of a tongue.<br>
<sup>6</sup>I saw the Holy Family arrive at Anne’s, in Nazareth. <br>
<sup>7</sup>The eldest sister of Mary, Mary Heli, with her daughter Mary Cleophas, a woman from Elizabeth’s place, and that one of Anne’s maids who had been with Mary in Bethlehem were there. <br>
<sup>8</sup>A feast was held such as had been celebrated at the departure of the child Mary for the Temple. <br>
<sup>9</sup>Lamps burned above the table, and there were some old priests present. <br>
<sup>10</sup>Things went on quietly. <br>
<sup>11</sup>Though there was great joy over the Child Jesus, yet it was a calm, inward joy. <br>
<sup>12</sup>I have never seen much excitement among those holy souls. <br>
<sup>13</sup>They partook of a slight repast, the women as usual eating apart from the men. <br>
<sup>14</sup>I can remember no more of this vision, although I must have been present in a very real way, for I had to accomplish in it a work of prayer.<br>
<sup>15</sup>The early Christians. <br>
<sup>16</sup>In Anne’s garden, notwithstanding the season, I saw numbers of pears, plums, and other fruits still on the trees, although the leaves had already fallen.<br>
<sup>17</sup>I have always forgotten to say a word about the weather in Palestine during the winter season, because being so accustomed to it myself, I think that everyone else knows it, too. <br>
<sup>18</sup>I often see rain and fog, and sometimes snow, but it soon melts away, and I see many trees upon which fruit is still hanging. <br>
<sup>19</sup>There are in the year several harvests, the first in what corresponds to our spring. <br>
<sup>20</sup>In the present season, winter, I see the people on the roads wrapped up in mantles which are thrown over the head also. <br>
<sup>21</sup>On the sacred night of Christmas, I always see everything green, blossoming, and full of flowers, the animals frolicsome, the vineyards laden with luscious grapes, and I hear the sweet caroling of birds; but immediately after, it is again quiet and just as it usually is there at this season. <br>
<sup>22</sup>The tree outside of Bethlehem and under which Mary stood while Joseph was seeking an inn was, as long as she remained under it, quite green. <br>
<sup>23</sup>It afforded ample shelter. <br>
<sup>24</sup>But when she left it, it resumed its wintry nakedness. <br>
<sup>25</sup>This was perhaps only a mark of reverence; but the Blessed Virgin was fully conscious of it. <br>
<sup>26</sup>The shepherd field was, however, already green at this season, for they watered it.<br>
<sup>27</sup>The road from Anne’s house to Joseph’s in Nazareth was about one half-hour’s distance, and ran between gardens and hills. <br>
<sup>28</sup>I saw Joseph at Anne’s loading two asses with many different things, and going on before with Anne’s maid to Nazareth. <br>
<sup>29</sup>Mary followed with Anne, who carried the Child Jesus.<br>
<sup>30</sup>Mary and Joseph had no care of the housekeeping. <br>
<sup>31</sup>They were provided with all things by Anne, who often went to see them. <br>
<sup>32</sup>I saw her maid carrying provisions to them in two baskets, one on her head, the other in her hand.<br>
<sup>33</sup>I saw the Blessed Virgin knitting, or crocheting little robes. <br>
<sup>34</sup>To her right side was fastened a ball of wool and she had in her hands two short needles of bone, I think, with little hooks at the end; one was about half an ell long, the other shorter. <br>
<sup>35</sup>The stitches were arranged on the needles above the hooks, over which in doing the work the thread was thrown, and the stitch thus formed. <br>
<sup>36</sup>The finished web hung between the two needles. <br>
<sup>37</sup>I saw Mary thus working, either standing or sitting by the Child Jesus, who lay in His little basket cradle.<br>
<sup>38</sup>I saw St. Joseph, out of long strips of bark—yellow, brown, and green—platting screens, large sur-faces, and covers for ceilings. <br>
<sup>39</sup>He had a stock of this woven board-like work piled under a shed near the house. <br>
<sup>40</sup>He wove into them all kinds of patterns, stars, hearts, etc. <br>
<sup>41</sup>I thought as I looked at them that he had no idea how soon he would have to leave all.<br>
<sup>42</sup>I saw the Holy Family while at Nazareth visited also by Mary Heli. <br>
<sup>43</sup>She came with St. <br>
<sup>44</sup>Anne, bring-ing with her her grandson, a boy of about four years, the child of her daughter Mary Cleophas. <br>
<sup>45</sup>I saw the holy women sitting together, caressing the Child Jesus, and laying It in the little boy’s arms; they acted just as people do nowadays. <br>
<sup>46</sup>Mary Heli lived in a little town about three hours east of Nazareth. <br>
<sup>47</sup>She had a house almost as large as her mother’s. <br>
<sup>48</sup>It had a courtyard surrounded by a wall, and in it a well with a pump. <br>
<sup>49</sup>On pressing with the foot at the base of the pump, the water flowed out into a stone basin before it. <br>
<sup>50</sup>Mary Heli’s husband was named Cleophas. <br>
<sup>51</sup>Their daughter Mary Cleophas, who had married Alpheus, lived at the other end of the town.<br>
<sup>52</sup>That evening I saw the holy women praying together. <br>
<sup>53</sup>They were standing in front of a little table, which was fastened to the wall and covered with red and white. <br>
<sup>54</sup>On it lay a roll which Mary unfolded and hung up on the wall. <br>
<sup>55</sup>A figure was embroidered on it in pale colors; it was like a corpse entirely enveloped in a long, white mantle. <br>
<sup>56</sup>It had something in its arms. <br>
<sup>57</sup>I saw a picture like it at Anne’s during the festival before Mary’s departure for her Presentation in the Temple. <br>
<sup>58</sup>A lamp was burning during their prayer. <br>
<sup>59</sup>Mary stood a little in front of the table with Anne and Mary Heli on either side. <br>
<sup>60</sup>At certain times, they crossed their hands upon their breast, folded them together, or stretched them forth. <br>
<sup>61</sup>Mary read out of a roll that lay before her. <br>
<sup>62</sup>They prayed in measured and steady tones; it reminded me of choir chanting.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Flight into Egypt</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup>When Herod saw that the Kings did not return, he thought they had failed to find Jesus, and the whole affair seemed to be dying out. <br>
<sup>2</sup>But after Mary’s return to Nazareth, Herod heard of Simeon’s and Anna’s prophecies at the Presentation of the Child in the Temple, and his fears were reawakened. <br>
<sup>3</sup>I saw him in as great disquietude as at the time of the Kings’ stay in Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>4</sup>He was conferring with some aged Jews who read to him from long rolls of writings mounted on rods. <br>
<sup>5</sup>He had given orders for a number of men to be gathered together in a large court, and there provided with weapons and uniforms. <br>
<sup>6</sup>Things went on as they do with us when soldiers are recruited. <br>
<sup>7</sup>I saw that he sent these troops to various places around Jerusalem, from which the mothers were to be summoned to the Holy City. <br>
<sup>8</sup>He caused their numbers to be everywhere ascertained. <br>
<sup>9</sup>He took these precautions in order to prevent the tumult that would necessarily follow if the news of the projected slaughter of the children was spread. <br>
<sup>10</sup>I saw those soldiers in three different places, in Bethlehem, in Gilgal, and in Hebron. <br>
<sup>11</sup>The inhabitants were in great consternation, because not able to divine why a garrison was placed in their towns. <br>
<sup>12</sup>The soldiers remained about nine months in those places, and the murder of the little ones began when John was about two years old.<br>
<sup>13</sup>Anne and Mary Heli were still at the home of the Holy Family in Nazareth. <br>
<sup>14</sup>Mary, with her Child, slept in the apartment to the right behind the fireplace; Anne, to the left; and between hers and that of St. <br>
<sup>15</sup>Joseph, Mary Heli. <br>
<sup>16</sup>These rooms were not so high as the house itself, and were cut off from one another only by wicker partitions. <br>
<sup>17</sup>The ceiling also was of wickerwork. <br>
<sup>18</sup>Mary’s couch was surrounded by a curtain, or screen. <br>
<sup>19</sup>At her feet, in His own little bed, lay the Infant Jesus within Mary’s reach when she sat upright. <br>
<sup>20</sup>I saw a radiant youth standing at the side of Joseph’s couch and speaking to him. <br>
<sup>21</sup>Joseph sat up, but overcome by sleep, again lay down. <br>
<sup>22</sup>Then the youth caught him by the hand and raised him up. <br>
<sup>23</sup>Joseph, now thoroughly aroused, stood up and the youth vanished. <br>
<sup>24</sup>Then I saw Joseph going to the lamp that burned in the center of the house, and getting a light. <br>
<sup>25</sup>He proceeded to Mary’s chamber, knocked, and asked permission to enter. <br>
<sup>26</sup>I saw him going in and speaking to Mary who, however, did not open her screen. <br>
<sup>27</sup>After this he went out to the stable for the ass, and returning, went into a room wherein were stored all kinds of household goods. <br>
<sup>28</sup>He was getting things ready for a journey. <br>
<sup>29</sup>Mary arose, quickly clothed herself for travelling, and went to arouse Anne, who got up at once along with Mary Heli and the little boy. <br>
<sup>30</sup>I cannot express how touching was the trouble of Anne and the sister. <br>
<sup>31</sup>Anne embraced Mary over and over again with many tears, clasping her to her heart as if she were never again to see her. <br>
<sup>32</sup>The sister threw herself flat on the floor, and wept. <br>
<sup>33</sup>Only just before setting out, did they take the Infant Jesus from His little bed. <br>
<sup>34</sup>They all pressed the Child to their heart, and It was given to the little boy to embrace. <br>
<sup>35</sup>Mary then took the Child upon her breast, resting It in a strip of stuff that fastened over her shoulders. <br>
<sup>36</sup>A long mantle enveloped both Mother and Child, and Mary wore over her head a large veil, which hung down on both sides of her face. <br>
<sup>37</sup>She made but few preparations for the journey, and all she did was done quietly and quickly. <br>
<sup>38</sup>I did not see her even swathing the Child afresh. <br>
<sup>39</sup>The holy travelers took only a few things with them, far fewer than they had brought from Bethlehem, only a little bundle and some coverings. <br>
<sup>40</sup>Joseph had a leathern bottle filled with water and a basket with compartments in it, in which were loaves, little jugs, and live birds. <br>
<sup>41</sup>There was a cross seat for Mary and the Child on the ass, also a little footboard. <br>
<sup>42</sup>They went forward a short distance with Anne, for they took the road in the direction to her house, only somewhat more to the left. <br>
<sup>43</sup>When Joseph approached with the ass, Anne again embraced and blessed Mary, who then mounted and rode off. <br>
<sup>44</sup>It was not yet midnight when they left the house. <br>
<sup>45</sup>The Child Jesus was twelve weeks old. <br>
<sup>46</sup>I had seen three times four weeks.<br>
<sup>47</sup>I saw Mary Heli going to her mother’s house in order to send Eliud with a servant to Nazareth, after which she returned with the boy to her own home. <br>
<sup>48</sup>I next saw Anne in Joseph’s house packing everything up for Eliud and the servant to remove to her own house.<br>
<sup>49</sup>The Holy Family passed by many places that night, and not till morning did I see them resting under a shed and taking a little refreshment.<br>
<sup>50</sup>I saw them taking their first night’s lodgings in the little village of Nazara, between Legio and Mas-saloth. <br>
<sup>51</sup>The poor, oppressed people of this place who lodged the Holy Family were not, properly speaking, Jews. <br>
<sup>52</sup>They had to go far over a mountainous road to Samaria to worship, for their temple was on Mt. <br>
<sup>53</sup>Garizim, and they always had to work like slaves on the Temple of Jerusalem and other public buildings. <br>
<sup>54</sup>The Holy Family could go no further. <br>
<sup>55</sup>They were well received by these outcasts with whom they remained the whole of the following day. <br>
<sup>56</sup>On their return from Egypt, they again visited those poor people. <br>
<sup>57</sup>They did the same both going and returning from the Temple the first time that the Child Jesus made the journey to it. <br>
<sup>58</sup>The whole family at a later period was baptized by John, and they afterward joined the disciples of Jesus.<br>
<sup>59</sup>The Holy Family on their flight met only three inns at which to spend the night: here, at Nazara; again at Anim, or Engannim, among the camel dealers; and lastly, among the robbers. <br>
<sup>60</sup>At other times, they rested during their tiresome wanderings in valleys and caves and the most out-of-the-way places. <br>
<sup>61</sup>Further on from Nazara, I saw them hidden under the great pine tree near which Mary, on her journey to Bethlehem, had been so cold. <br>
<sup>62</sup>The persecution of Herod was known in these parts and it was, consequently, unsafe for them. <br>
<sup>63</sup>The Ark of the Covenant had once rested under this tree, when Joshua assembled the people and made them renounce their idols.<br>
<sup>64</sup>Later, I saw the Holy Family by a well and balsam bush resting and refreshing themselves. <br>
<sup>65</sup>The branches of the bush were notched, and out of them oozed the balsam in drops. <br>
<sup>66</sup>The Child Jesus lay on Mary’s lap, His little feet bare. <br>
<sup>67</sup>To the left behind them, lay Jerusalem far up above the level of the country in which they then were.<br>
<sup>68</sup>When the Holy Family had passed the walls of Gaza, I saw them in the wilderness. <br>
<sup>69</sup>No words can depict the difficulties of this journey. <br>
<sup>70</sup>They always travelled a mile eastward of the ordinary highway and, as they shunned the public inns, they suffered the want of all necessaries. <br>
<sup>71</sup>I saw them quite exhausted with not a drop of water (the little jug was empty) drawing near to a low bush some distance from the road. <br>
<sup>72</sup>The Blessed Virgin alighted from the ass and sat down upon the dry grass. <br>
<sup>73</sup>Suddenly there jetted high before them a spring of water, which spread over the plain. <br>
<sup>74</sup>I witnessed their joy. <br>
<sup>75</sup>Joseph dug a hole at a little distance, and led the ass to it. <br>
<sup>76</sup>The poor beast gladly drank from it as it filled. <br>
<sup>77</sup>Mary bathed the Child in the spring, and refreshed herself. <br>
<sup>78</sup>The sun shone out beautifully for a short time, and the weary travelers were strengthened and full of grateful emotion. <br>
<sup>79</sup>They tarried here for two or three hours. <br>
<sup>80</sup>On the sixth night, I saw them in a cave near the mount and city of Ephraim. <br>
<sup>81</sup>The cave was in a wild ravine, about one hour’s distance from the grove of Mambre. <br>
<sup>82</sup>I saw the Holy Family arrive, worn-out and dejected. <br>
<sup>83</sup>Mary was very sad; she wept, for they were in want of everything. <br>
<sup>84</sup>They rested here a whole day and many wonders were vouchsafed them for their refreshment. <br>
<sup>85</sup>A spring gushed forth in the cave, a wild goat came running to them and allowed itself to be milked, and they were visibly consoled by an angel. <br>
<sup>86</sup>One of the Prophets had often prayed in this cave. <br>
<sup>87</sup>Samuel had once sojourned in it, David had guarded his father’s sheep around it, and to it had often retired to pray. <br>
<sup>88</sup>He had in this cave, received through angels, the divine commands, among them that to slay Goliath.<br>
<sup>89</sup>The last stopping place of the Holy Family in Herod’s dominion was near its confines. <br>
<sup>90</sup>The innkeepers appeared to be camel dealers, for I saw a number of camels in an enclosed pasture ground. <br>
<sup>91</sup>The people were rude and wild, and they enriched themselves by thieving; still they received the Holy Family most graciously. <br>
<sup>92</sup>This place was distant a couple of hours from the Dead Sea.<br>
<sup>93</sup>Once I saw Mary sending a messenger to Elizabeth, who then brought her child to a very concealed place in the desert. <br>
<sup>94</sup>Zachary accompanied her only a part of the way. <br>
<sup>95</sup>When they reached a certain body of water, Elizabeth and the child crossed over on a raft, while Zachary went on to Nazareth by the same route taken by Mary on her visit to Elizabeth. <br>
<sup>96</sup>I saw him on his journey. <br>
<sup>97</sup>Perhaps he was going to make some inquiries, for there were some friends at Nazareth distressed at Mary’s departure.<br>
<sup>98</sup>On a starry night, I saw the Holy Family going through a sandy wilderness covered with low thick-ets. <br>
<sup>99</sup>The scene was as vivid before me, as if I were really crossing the desert with them. <br>
<sup>100</sup>Here and there under the copse wood, venomous snakes lay coiled. <br>
<sup>101</sup>With loud hissing, they approached the path and darted their heads angrily toward the Holy Family. <br>
<sup>102</sup>But they, shielded by the light that environed them, stepped securely along. <br>
<sup>103</sup>I saw other animals with immense fins like wings on their blackish body, with short feet, and a head like that of a fish. <br>
<sup>104</sup>They darted along, flying over the ground. <br>
<sup>105</sup>At last, the Holy Family came behind the bushes to a deep fissure in the ground, like the walls of a narrow defile, and here they rested.<br>
<sup>106</sup>The last place in Judea by which they passed, had a name that sounded like Mara. <br>
<sup>107</sup>I thought of Anne’s ancestral place, but it was not it. <br>
<sup>108</sup>The people were very rude and uncivilized, and the Holy Family could get nothing from them by way of refreshment.<br>
<sup>109</sup>Leaving this last place and scarcely knowing how to proceed, they pressed on through a desolate region. <br>
<sup>110</sup>They could find no road, and a dark, pathless mountain-height stretched out before them. <br>
<sup>111</sup>Mary was exhausted and very sad. <br>
<sup>112</sup>She knelt with Joseph, the Child in her arms, and cried to God. <br>
<sup>113</sup>And behold! Several large, wild beasts, like lions, came running around them, exhibiting friendly dispositions. <br>
<sup>114</sup>I understood that they had been sent to show the way. <br>
<sup>115</sup>They looked toward the mountain, ran thither and then turned back again, just like a dog that wants someone to follow it. <br>
<sup>116</sup>At last the Holy Family followed them and, after crossing the mountain, arrived at a very dismal region.</p><br>
