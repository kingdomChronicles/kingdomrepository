        <p class="chapterTitle">The crystal sea, God commands Adam, expelled from Eden, to live in the Cave of Treasures.</p>
              
                    <p><sup>1</sup> On the third day, God planted the garden in the east of the earth, on the border of the world eastward, beyond which, towards the sun-rising, one finds nothing but water, that encompasses the whole world, and reaches to the borders of heaven.</p>

                   
                 


                    CHAPTER VI.
                    After this, there began to issue a race from Naasson, who
                    was great among the sons of Judah; and from him began
                    a kingdom and a priesthood, and the Jews became celebrated
                    through him.
                    Then Naasson begat Salmon, and Salmon begat Boaz of
                    Rahab. And thou must know that from Boaz and Ruth the
                    Moabitess, began the kingdom whereby Lot, the son of
                    Abraham's brother, obtained a share [in the generations] of the kingdom [of Judah].
                    For God denied not seed to Lot, neither would He cut it short. For this Lot was righteous, and shared all Abraham's
                    troubles with him ; and received the angels of God in Sodomand Gomorrah.
                    Therefore did God give to Lot's children fellowship in the
                    kingdom, and that was [reckoned] for righteousness unto Lot
                    the righteous. For this reason also were [Lot's children]
                    mentioned among the genealogies of the kingdom of Abrahamand of Lot ; for Christ was born of their seed. Then, again, Obed, Ruth's son, was of Lot's seed, on his mother's [side] ; and Obed begat Jesse ; and Jesse begat
                    David the king. And king David begat Solomon ; all these
                    are of Ruth the Moabitess.
                    Again, Amnan,* the daughter of [Dan] , king of the Ammonites, was of Lot's seed ; and Solomon the king took this daughter of Dan to wifoj and had by her, Eehoboam, who
                    reigned after Solomon.
                    But king Solomon took to himself many wives, seven hundred daughters of kings, three hundred concubines, one
                    thousand in number.
                    But although Solomon took to himself these many wives,
                    they did not bare him a single male child, but Rehoboam, of
                    Amnan, the daughter of Dan, king of Ammon ; who was of a blessed race. Thus, again, God would not allow the seed of Canaanites to mingle with that of strange peoples, which God had made
                    strangers. And this shows that Christ came of the seed of
                    Abraham the blessed father, and of Lot his brother's son. And all the families of the children of Israel in the land of
                    Egypt, were Levi, Amram, Moses, Joshua, and Caleb, son of
                    Jephunneh ; all these were great chiefs over their peoples.


                    CHAPTER YII.
                    As to Moses, when they had thrown him into the river,
                    Sephurah, the daughter of Pharaoh, took him up thence, and
                    brought him up. She it is, whom the Hebrews call Mariam, the
                    mother of Moses.
                    And Moses abode forty years in Pharaoh's house ; and other
                    forty years in the land of Midian, ere God spake to him.
                    Then, again, when God spake to Moses from within the bush
                    his tongue faltered ; and [his] tongue wasâ€”as God said, " From
                    the time that I spake to My servant Moses, he was of a faltering
                    tongue.''
                    And Moses dwelt forty years in the land of Egypt, and forty
                    years in the land of Midian, with the priest Jethro, his father- in-law ; then forty years more in the wilderness ; when Moses
                    died, aged one hundred and twenty years. 
                    Then after him arose Joshua, the ton of Nun. He was twenty-seven years judge over the children of Israel, and
                    exorcised judgment over them ; he was prophet among them,
                    and kept them, and led them in the right way j and he entered
                    into rest and died, when sixty years old. Then after him arose Kusarat the judge, eight years, and he
                    died ; and after him Phutamiral, the son of Kaba, judged the
                    children of Israel forty years, and died. After him Naod, son of Phuru, judged the children of Israel eighty years. But in the twenty-fifth year of Naod, ended
                    four thousand years since Adam. Naod died, and Sikar judged
                    the children of Israel. But in his days a king of Canaan rose
                    against Sikar, wishing to make war against him. But God
                    gave Sikar victory over him, whom he defeated; and Sikar
                    judged forty years. After him Yarod was judge over the people of Israel, forty
                    years ; and after him Abimelec judged ten years, and died. And after him Banu, son of Yuorani, judged twenty-three
                    years, and died. After him Yar of Phila, judged twenty-two
                    years, and died. After him the son of Aminadab, judged fifty-eight years, and
                    died. And after him the daughter of Nasyamu judged seven
                    years, and died. After her, Ansyus judged seven years, and died ; and after him the Philistine judged forty years. But God gave him
                    into the hands of the champion Samson, who slew him.
                    Then the champion Samson arose and was judge over the
                    children of Israel twenty years, and then died. Then the children of Israel were left without a judge twelve
                    years, when Eli the priest began to judge ; and judged them
                    forty years, and then died. After him Samuel was judge over the children of Israel forty
                    years, and. died. Then after him, Saul reigned over them forty
                    years, and died. Then after him, David reigned over the children of Israel forty years, and then died. And after him, his son Solomon arose, who also reigned forty years over the children of Israel,
                    and then died. He wrought more wonders in the earth than all other kings,
                    who were before him. For he was the first whom God filled with wisdom. So that he made [and did] many things peculiar to him ; so far as to make a ship, and go in it to the city of
                    Saphir; [where] he wrought gold in ornaments, and brought
                    it to Jerusalem.
                    During his reign, there was great peace ; there was no
                    trouble ; but there was peace between him and Hiram king of Tyre ; who reigned five hundred years over the city of Tyre,
                    and whose kingdom lasted from the reign of Solomon, to that
                    of Zedekiah ; until, from the length of his days and of his years, and from the greatness of his kingdom, he exalted
                    himself and said, " I am God, and no man."'^
                    God was wroth against him because of his evil deed ; and
                    God looked down upon it, and delivered him into the hands of king Nebuchadnezzar who put him to death ; removed his army,
                    and took his spoil.

                    
                    CHAPTER VIII.
                    But we will inform thee of the things king Solomon'^ gave
                    every day in his house. On account of his many wives, they
                    made bread in his house of thirty cores of fine flour ; one hundred cores of wheat flour, which hardly sufiiced. And they
                    slaughtered in his house daily, ten bullocks well-fatted, and
                    twenty fat oxen, and one hundred sheep ; besides what they
                    slew of bufialoes, gazelles and wild deer, which they hunted
                    every day. And in Solomon's house they drank daily four
                    hundred basins of wine. And many other things did they.
                    And Solomon reigned over his large kingdom with the
                    greatest wisdom ever found. But he did not keep his soul
                    ;
                    but inclined his heart to the love of women, and forsook God who had created him, and who had given him this kingdom.
                    And he died in his denial of Him, and iu his sins. After him reigned Rehoboam, his son, seventeen years, and
                    did evil. He defiled Jerusalem with abominable sacrifices,
                    and sacrificed to Satan ; and adultery increased greatly in his days. Wherefore God cut off his kingdom swiftly ; and took
                    it from the house of David.
                    But in the fifth year of Rehoboam, a king whose name was Susakim came up against Jerusalem. He took all the spoil of the temple, and spoiled all Roboam had, and spoiled all the
                    house of David, and removed them and took them to his owncountry.
                    And he boasted, and said to the Jews, " The things I have
                    taken from you as spoil, are goods that belonged to my fathers,
                    of which your fathers spoiled them, when they came out of the
                    land of Egypt, and which they brought unto this place ; and
                    behold, I have taken them from you."
                    And Rehoboam died in his denial [of God] ; and after him, his son Abius, reigned twenty years over the children of Israel. But he, too, walked in his father's ways, by reason of Makia
                    his mother, the daughter of Absalom ; wherefore, did he manywicked things, and then died. After him arose Asaph his son, who reigned forty-one years over the children of Israel. He did what was right, just and
                    good before God ; he brake down the idols that were in his day, and removed their images from the face of the land
                    ;
                    and he took his wicked mother Anna, and threw her downfrom the roof [of her house] and she died, because of her
                    adulteries. After that, came Eleazar a black king, who was king of Endena, to fight Asaph. But God delivered him into the hands
                    of Asaph, who defeated him.
                    Then Asaph died ; and his son Jehoshaphat reigned in his stead. He also did that which is just and good before God, and
                    pleased God all his days, and then died. 


                    Then his son Aram reigned in his stead ; but he transgressed
                    the commandments of God, and forsook His law, and sacrificed unto idols. Then Zambri rose up against him, made war against him,
                    and he died in his denial [of God]
                    .
                    Then Yusia, his son, reigned [after him] ; but on account
                    of his transgressions, God delivered him into the hands of his enemies, who put him to death. But when he was dead, his mother rose up against all the royal children and put them to death, and said, " I will take the kingdom from the house of David."
                    Then Yusabet daughter of the king of Aram, arose, took
                    Agragarina, and slew him before the eyes of the royal children
                    that were left. But when she had put him to death, she feared,
                    and hid herself and those with her, under a bed. And Gotholia was queen over the children of Israel, and died. Then the whole people of Israel said, " Whom shall we make
                    king over us V
                    Then when Yuda the high priest heard they spake thus, he
                    gathered together the whole of the Jews within the Temple,
                    and waited until the messengers of thousands and the
                    messengers of hundreds came ; and then Yuda the high priest,
                    said to them, " What do you require of me, and who is he
                    whom ye will make king over the house of David ?" Then they said to him, " Thou hast authority."
                    Then Yuda rose and took Barsia, and brought him before
                    them, and said to them, " Does this one suit you for a king VThe people were pleased with him ; so Yuda brought him
                    into the house of God, and set him over the kingdom ; then
                    all the people rejoiced, and the whole country was quiet in
                    his days ; and he was king in Jerusalem forty years. But Barsia did not bear in mind all the good things Yuda
                    the priest had told him; but he took him and put him to death. After this, enemies rose up against Barsia and put
                    him also to death.

                    CHAPTER IX.
                    After him his son Araazias reigned twenty-nine years, and
                    put to death those who had killed his father; but he did not
                    put to death their children, so as to fulfil the law of Moses,
                    that says, " Ye shall not put to death children for the sins of
                    their fathers." Then Amazias died, and after him Ozia reigned fifty-two years, and in his reign exercised justice and judgment, and
                    right before God. Yet did he do one wicked act, and that was thatâ€”without due orders,* he offered sacrifices unto God,
                    and oblations that did not become hira. So he died. After him Yonathan his son, reigned sixteen years. But
                    during his reign, he did eyil before God, and angered his Creator, and forsook His commandment and His law ; and
                    burnt incense to idols, and sacrificed unto them. For this reason
                    did God deliver him to death, into the hands of Caran, king
                    of Elmosal.f
                    And when the king of Elmosal led him away [captive] , he
                    [Yonathan] took all the vessels he found in the house of God,
                    and sent them all to the great king of Elmosal ; and left nothing
                    in the house of God.
                    In the days of this king, did the children of Israel, go the
                    first time into captivity. He removed them to his own country,
                    and the land of Israel remained bare. Then the king of Elmosal, sent people to dwell in the
                    land and to till it, instead of the children of Israel who had
                    left it. But when those people came to dwell in that land, [wild]
                    beasts rent them asunder and devoured them, and prevailed
                    against them in all the borders of the land. Then they sent word to the king in their own tongue, and
                    asked him to send them Urias the priest, to give them the law, so that wild beasts should no longer come near them, and
                    hurt them.
                    When the king heard this he sent them Urias the priest,
                    and commanded him to give them a law, for them to keep, so
                    that the wild beasts hurt them not. Urias the priest came, and did as the king had commanded
                    him, and he gave the people the law of the Jews ; it was in
                    their hands, they recited it and ruled themselves after it. And
                    those were the Samar; whom the king, of whom we have
                    just spoken, had sent to till the land of Israel. Then Yunathan died, and after him reigned Akaz his son, who did well before God, and then died. After him reigned his son Hezkias, when he was twenty-five
                    years old ; and he reigned twenty-two years ; and did good,
                    and judgment, equity and justice ; and he pleased the Lord
                    ;
                    he kept His law and His commandments ; he brake down the
                    idols, and destroyed their houses.
                    But in the fourth year of his reign, came Sanakreb king of
                    Assarium, and took away captive all that were left and sent them to Babylon.
                    But Hezkias served the Lord God, and fulfilled His law, until he fell sick and became very weak, and was in great distress by reason of his sickness ; his heart suffered, and he said to himself, " Woe is me ! I shall die without a son to reign after me."
                    And in his sickness he wept before Grod and said, " Woe is me, Lord ! behold, I die without a son ; and behold the
                    promise Thou madest unto David, shall fail in me ; and the
                    kingdom shall pass from the house of David.''
                    Then God looked upon his sorrow of heart, and upon his sickness, for his sickness was sore. And God had pity on him
                    and gave him fifteen years over and above the rest of his days;
                    and he recovered from his sickness.
                    Then three years after he had recovered, and God had
                    raised him from his sickness, he begat Manasseh. And he died, rejoicing greatly at having a son born unto him, to sit upon his throne.


                    After him Manasseh his son reigned twelve years in Jerusalem. He did much evil, and made the people of
                    Jerusalem worship idols.^^ Then when he had thus transgressed the law of God, Isaias the prophet came to him and rebuked him for the wickednesses
                    he had wrought.
                    Then Manasseh was angry with him, and commanded valiant
                    and wicked men to take Isaias the prophet, and to saw himasunder with a saw of wood,* from his head down to his feet,
                    among the trees of the wilderness ; and then to cast him to the beasts [of the field] to devour him. And they did so to him.i*
                    Isaias was then one hundred and twenty years old. Hisraiment was of shaggy goat^s hair upon his body; and hefasted regularly every second day [of the week] all the days of
                    his life. Then Manasseh died ; and after him reigned his son Amots,who did evil before God ; for he offered sons and daughters
                    in sacrifice unto idols. Then Amots died; and after him reigned Yusias his son. He was twenty years old when he [began] to reign, andcontinued twenty-two years in his kingdom in the city of Jerusalem. He did justice and right before God; and keptthe Passover of the Lord, such as the children of Israel neverwere able to keep, except the one Moses kept for them in the
                    wilderness. This king purified Jerusalem of all wickedness.
                    But Pharhon the lame, king of Egypt, killed Yusias in Carmelos.

                    Then after him Akaz reigned three months. But Pharhon
                    bound Akaz in chains and sent him into the land of Egypt
                    ;
                    and he died in that place.
                    After his death Yuakem his brother reigned fourteen years
                    ;
                    but in the third year of his reign, Nabukadanatsor came to the
                    city of Jerusalem, and God delivered Yuakem into his hands ; and Yuakem was under his orders, bowed unto him, and paid
                    him tribute ; he then sickened and died. After him reigned his brother Yekonias three months ; then came Nabukadanatsor who took captive Yekonias and all his army, and sent them to Babylon.
                    On the way thither, Daniel's mother gave him birth. Anania,
                    Azaria, and Misael, sons of Yekonias, were also bom on the first transportation of Yuakem.
                    Then Yekonias died, and after him Zedekias reigned twelve
                    years. This was the end of kings that reigned over the
                    children of Israel, and all Judah; after them no king was
                    left to them.
                    And at the end of the fourteenth year of Zedekias, Nabukadanatsor came and transported all the people of Jerusalem, as
                    far as the west, and as far as the river Euphrates, and as far as the great river. He laid waste Tyre, and burnt Hiram king of
                    Tyre with fire, who had reigned five hundred years. Then after this Nabukadanatsor went into Egypt, and put to death Pharhon ; destroyed his army, and laid waste the land
                    of Egypt ; and then took the city of Jerusalem. And God
                    delivered Zedekias into his hands, whom he took, and brought
                    out before idols, and set him before the people, and slew his children before him, without pity. He then put out his eyes, bound his hands with chains and his feet with fetters; and sent him to Babylon, because of his folly, and of the evil he had
                    done to Irmias* the prophet, by casting him into springs of
                    water in a marsh."

                    After this Nabuzaradan captain of the king's array, destroyed
                    the walls of Jerusalem, burnt the House of God with fire ; and
                    did all manner of evil to Jerusalem.
                    But Simeon the priest, found favour and grace with the
                    captain of the king's army, and requested him to give him the
                    house* of records ; and he gave him a command accordingly.
                    Then Simeon the priest came in and gathered together the
                    ashes of the books, and laid them in a pot in a vault, and he
                    took a censer of brass, and put fire therein, and threw pure
                    incense upon it, and hung it in the vault over the place in which the ashes of the books lay.
                    But [Nebuzaradan] laid waste Jerusalem, like a wilderness.
                    And Jeremiah the prophet sat weeping and mourning over Jerusalem twenty years, after which this prophet Jeremiah
                    went into the land of Kgypt, and died there. But the writers and the interpreters destroyed the writings,
                    and the Hebrews changed the writings; and the Syrians and
                    the Greeks rejected many sections of those writings. So that
                    the children of the people could not ascertain [their kindred],
                    neither could men or women hear who were their fathers or
                    their mothers, except very few of them ; And this was because of the laying waste of Jerusalem ; so
                    that until this day, nothing certain is found among the
                    writings, except the chief writings alone, which writings had
                    been translated before the ruin of Jerusalem.
                    Then again since some of the writings were altered, people
                    could not ascertain how they were married, and could not
                    know who were their wives or daughters ; they did not know
                    their names or their kindred ; nor the order of generations
                    ;
                    neither did they know that of the priesthood.
                    And Jechonias remained twienty-seven years bound in prison
                    at Babylon. After that he was released by Marzuk king of Babylon, who gave him to wife, a woman called Dalilah daughter of Eliakim, by whom he had Salathiel in Babylon. But
                    Jechonias, Salathiel's father, died at Babylon.
                    Then Salathiel took to wife Hadast, daughter of Elkanah
                    ;
                    and had by her Zerubbabel. And Zerubbabel married a woman whose name was Malka, daughter of Ezra the scribe
                    ;
                    but he had no child by her in Babylon.
                    Then in the days of Zerubbabel, who was elder among
                    the children of Israel, a Persian king, called Cyrus, who
                    reigned over Babylon, took to wife a woman called Meshar,
                    sister of Zerubbabel, elder among the children of Israel ; and
                    he made her queen after the manner of the queens of Persia. And when she became queen, she found favour with the king,
                    and asked him to show mercy to the children of Israel, and
                    to send them back to the city of Jerusalem.

                    CHAPTER XI.
                    But Cyrus loved much Meshar, sister of Zerubbabel, [even] as his own soul. So he gave an urgent order that they should go about the
                    whole land of the Chaldaeans, and gather together the children
                    of Israel into Babylon, the house of the kingdom ; and they
                    gathered them according to the king's order. Then Cyrus said to Zerubbabel, his wife's brother, " Take
                    thy people and go to thy city Jerusalem ; and rebuild it as it was at first. Then when dutiful Cyrus had given this order concerning
                    the return of the children of Israel to Jerusalem, in the land of
                    the sanctuary
                    ;
                    God appeared unto him in a vision during sleep, and said
                    unto him, "Because thou hast done this, they shall call thee
                    Cyrus the Messiahnic; and this name, Messiahnic, shall be
                    given thee, because thou hast sent back strangers to their own city ; and because thou hast given commandment concerning
                    the rebuilding of Jerusalem."
                    Then the children of Israel returned from the captivity of
                    Babylon, Zerubbabel was elder over them; and Josiah, son
                    of Zadok, of the sons of Aaron, was high priest over them ; as the angel of God spake to the prophet Zachariah saying,
                    ''Those two sons that stand before the Lord of the whole
                    earth shall minister unto them, as becomes their service."
                    Cyrus had assumed the kingdom two years, when the
                    captivity returned from Babylon ; and at the end of that year, the five thousand years [spoken ofj to Adam were fulfilled. But when the children of Israel returned from Babylon they
                    had not the law, neither was there a book in their hands
                    ;
                    .inasmuch as the voices of the prophets had departed from
                    among them.
                    So, when they came to Jerusalem and were settled in it, Ezra the scribe came to the vault in which were the ashes of
                    the books, which Simeon the priest, had gathered together.
                    And Ezra found the censer that was full of fire, hanging
                    with [smoke of] incense rising from it on high.
                    Then Ezra prayed to God, wept abundantly, and spread his hand towards the ashes of the books of the law and of the
                    prophets, and all of them three times.*
                    Then came the Spirit of God upon him, and the [same]
                    Spirit spake through him that had spoken through the
                    prophets. And he wrote the law and the prophets, andmade them new a second time.
                    And the fire which he found in the censer, is the divine fire that was all the time in the House of God.
                    Then Zerubbabel settled in Jerusalem as king over the
                    children of Israel, and Josiah son of Zadok as high priest, withEzra the scribe of the law and the prophets also, as chief overthe children of Israel. 
                    And the children of Israel kept a solemn Passover unto the
                    Lord, when they returned from their captivity at Babylon.
                    These were the three great, full and solemn feasts of the
                    Passover, which the children of Israel kept during their existence. The first Passover was in Egypt, in the days of
                    Moses ; the second Passover was in the days of king Josiah
                    ;
                    and the third Passover was when they returned from their captivity in Babylon.


                    CHAPTER XII.
                    From the first transportation to Babylon, when they carried
                    away Daniel's mother, and she brought him forth, unto the
                    second year of Cyrus the Persian, are seventy years, during
                    which the children of Israel were captive, according to the
                    prophecy of holy* Jeremiah the prophet.
                    And the children of Israel began to build the House of God,
                    in the days of Zerubbabel, of Josiah the son of Zadok, and of
                    Ezra the scribe. And they were forty-six years building it, until it was finished, as it is written in the holy Gospelâ€”that
                    they were forty-six years building it. Moreover, scribes arranged tables of genealogy, and recorded
                    the names of the men ; but they could not record the names of the women because they knew them not, except very few.
                    But, my brethren, I have watched much, and I have
                    searched long in the books of the Greeks and of the ancient
                    Hebrews, and I have found the name of the women written in them.
                    For I found that when the children of Israel came from
                    Babylon, that Zerubbabel begat Abiud of Maukabf the daughter
                    of Ezra the scribe ; and that Abiud took to wife Tsamita the
                    daughter of Zadok the high priest, and she bare Eliakim.

                    And Eliakim married Hasbia, the daughter of Aram, and
                    brought forth Azar. And Azar begat Zadok of Lebaida.
                    And Zadok took to wife Kalem, the daughter of Waikam, whogave birth to Akim.
                    And Akim married Asbaidi, who gave birth to Eliud. AndEliud married Awad, the daughter of Gasulius, who gave birth
                    to Azar.
                    And Azar married Hayat, daughter of Walha, who brought
                    forth Mattan ; and Mattan married Sabartyal the daughter of Phulius, who brought forth twins, namely, Jacob and Joachim.
                    And Jacob married Gadat, the daughter of Eleazar, whogave birth to Joseph the betrothed of Mary. And Joachim,
                    the brother of Jacob, married Hannah the daughter of Makah
                    ;
                    and she brought forth the pure Virgin Mary ; and of her wasborn Christ. The former scribes, however, could not find a good lineage
                    for the Virgin and her father, or kindred; wherefore did the
                    Jews crucify Christ, and taunt Him, and mock Him, and say to Him, " Show us the fathers of Mary the Virgin and her people,
                    and what is her genealogy.'* Therefore did they blaspheme
                    her and Christ. But henceforth shall the mouth of those unbelieving Jews beclosed ; and they shall know that Mary is of the seed of David
                    the king, and of that of the patriarch Abraham.
                    Moreover, the unbelieving Jews had no registers to guide
                    them aright, neither did they know, how the lines of kindred
                    ran at first, inasmuch as the law and the prophets were three
                    times burnt [out] from them.
                    The first time in the days of Antiochus, who burnt down the
                    whole House [of God] ; The second time they burnt those
                    books in the days of Qablar the great king of Mosul ; And the
                    third time* they burnt the books was at the transportation byking Nabukadanatsor when Abumirdan came and burnt the House of God, and destroyed the walls of Jerusalem; when
                    Simeon the priest asked of him the store of books, and he gave
                    them to him. 


                    CHAPTER XIII.
                    But we will make known to you all the genealogies in detail. Judah begat Pharez, and Pharez married Barayah, the daughter
                    of Levi, and begat Esrom.

                    he begat Naasson. And Naasson married Simar, the daughter
                    of Yuhanas, and he begat Salmon; and Salmon married
                    Saphila, the daughter of Aminadab, by whom he had Booz.
                    And Booz married Ruth the Moabitess, of the seed of Mot,
                    and begat Obed; and Obed married Abalit, the daughter of

                    And king David took to wife Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah,
                    and begat Solomon. And Solomon married Nan, the same as Makiya, the daughter of Dan king of Ammon, of the seed of
                    Lot, and begat Rehoboam.

                    daughter of Habralias, and begat Jotham.
                    And Jotham married Hadast, the daughter of Elkanah, and begat Ahaz. And Ahaz married Bikaz^ the daughter of
                    Zachariah, and begat Hezekiah ; and Hezekiah married

                    Amos married Nadyas, and begat Josias. And Josias married
                    Dalilah, the daughter of Kermias, and begat Joachim.
                    And Joachim married Phurdia, the daughter of Phulek,
                    and begat Jechonias and his brother during the captivity of Babylon.
                    And Marsas who reigned over Babylon, released Jechonias
                    from prison, and gave him to wife, a woman whose name was
                    Dalilah, the daughter of Eliakim, by whom he had Salathiel. But Jechonias died at Babylon ; where Salathiel continued
                    forty-nine years after him, and married Hadast, the daughter
                    of Elkauah, and begat Zerubbabel. And Zerubbabel married
                    Maukab, the daughter of Esdras the scribe, and had by her
                    Abiud.
                    And Abiud married Hadast, the daughter of Zadok the high

                    And Jacob married Gadat, the daughter of Eleazar, andbegat Joseph the betrothed [husband] of Mary.
                    But Joachim married Hannah, the daughter of Makah, andbegat the pure Mary ; Here ends the genealogy of pure
                    Mary. 



                    CHAPTER XIV.
                    And here, O my brother, behold, I have settled for thee
                    that which is true, and I have revealed unto thee the genealpgy,
                    and laid for thee the firm foundation, which not one of the
                    writers and of the wise men, could make known.
                    But, O my brother, give me thy heart and make it clean,
                    that I may tell thee what things remain, and how the reckoning
                    of generations come all round to reach unto and to stand firm
                    by the birth of Christ. But after the birth of Christ there remained no more
                    trustworthy reckoning [of kindred] to the Jews. For Christ was the end of the generations ; He took it and gave it to us. But let me tell thee, O my brother, that the five thousand
                    years from [the creation of] Adam, did not end before
                    the days of Cyrus, king of Persia. Then from Cyrus to the
                    sufferings of our Saviour Jesus Christ, even as the faithful Daniel prophesied, saying, " After seven weeks Christ shall come, and shall be put to death."
                    Now seven weeks are four hundred and ninety years ; for a great week is of seventy years. But in that the prophet said,
                    "After seven years," he pointed to the ten years [that
                    remained] ; for he did not say, " Christ shall come at the end
                    of the seven weeks,'^ but he said, " After seven weeks [He
                    shall come] and be put to death."
                    But the meaning here of '' after," isâ€”those ten years, that
                    make up the five hundred years. And that is the fulfilment of
                    the promise that God made to Adam, that He would save him
                    at the end [of that time] .^^ Henceforth are the mouths of the Jews struck dumb, and to them belongs shame, because they blaspheme and say that
                    Christ is not yet come. But while they say so, they, of necessity, believe the first statement [of the prophets] to be true and the last to be a lie. If they say " Christ came/^ believing, as they do, the prophecyof the prophet Daniel, they now see that the prophecy of Daniel is fulfilled, and that the House of God is laid waste[and taken] from them ; that the priesthood is abolished, andthat the seven weeks were fulfilled, and that Christ came, andwas put to death ; and that the Holy City was laid waste byking Vespasian and his son Titus. " But let me also tell thee, my brother, that in the thirtysecond year of the reign of Augustus Caesar, Christ was bomin Bethlehem of Judah, as it is written in the Gospel. And,behold, it is made plain to us, that Christ came when the
                    prophecy was fulfilled. As Micah the prophet said, " But thou, O Bethlehem, [in
                    the] land of Judah, thou art not lower than the kings of Judah
                    ;
                    for from thee shall come a king, that shall feed my people
                    Israel." Let the Jews now feel ashamed of themselves ; for if they
                    make Daniel a liar, they cannot again make the prophet Micaha liar; yet if they will make them liars still, behold, Christ was bom in Bethlehem [in] the land of Judah.
                    And when He was born at Bethlehem [in] the land of
                    Judah, a star in the East made it known, and was seen byMagi. That star shone in heaven, amid all the other stars
                    ;
                    it flashed and was like the face of a woman, a young virgin,
                    sitting among the stars, flashing, as it were carrying a little child of a beautiful countenance. From the beauty of His looks, both heaven and earth shone,
                    and were filled with His beauty and light above and below;
                    and that child was on the virgin woman's arms ; and there was
                    a cloud of light around the child's head, like a crown. But it was a custom of the Chaldaeans to observe the stars of heaven ; to take counsel from them ; and they were numbered by them.
                    So when they saw the star of the figure we have just mentioned, they were greatly troubled, and said among themselves, '* Surely the king of the Helonseans is putting himself
                    in battle array against us
                    !
                    
                    And they inquired among soothsayers and philosophers,
                    until they ascertained the fact and discovered that the king of
                    the children of Israel was born.
                    As to this matter of the stars, the ChaldaBans used to work
                    it out, and to take counsel from the power* of the stars ; so
                    that they knew every event that should be, ere it happened.
                    Likewise the captains of large ships, wh^n they went on a voyage upon the seas, [knew beforehand] the signs of winds,
                    of whirlwind, of gloom, and of thick darkness.
                    Thus the Magi when they read in their books, knew from
                    them, that Christ should be born in the land of Judah.
                    So they went upon a high mountain in the east, while
                    coming westward ; and they took with them the presents they
                    had prepared ere they set off on their journey ; that is, gold,
                    frankincense and myrrhâ€”that had been with Adam in the Cave
                    of Treasures. Gold, namely as unto a king ; frankincense, as unto God; and myrrh, as for His death. 


                    CHAPTER XV.
                    But when Hor, king of Persia, heard who it was they called King of kings, he prepared his chariot and mounted it. Basantar also, king of Saba, came out ; and Karsundas, king
                    of the East, got himself ready and came out also. They were all in great tribulation, and also all other kings
                    in the borders of the West trembled with them, and every
                    country in the East was in great alarm at the sight of that
                    glory. Then the Magi while on their journey said, " This star hasnot risen but for some great event/' And they went on their way until they came to Jerusalem.^''' But when Herod heard of it, he was troubled, and called theMagi to him, and communed with them ; and they rehearsedunto him the [whole] thing.
                    Then he and all his hosts trembled ; and he said to theMagi, " Go ye, and inquire diligently concerning this Child
                    ;
                    and when ye have found Him, come and tell me, that I also may go and worship Him.
                    Then the Magi went forthwith to Bethlehem, and foundChrist, and offered Him their gifts. But they did not returnto Herod ; they went back to their own country.
                    But after they were gone, Herod was wroth, and com-manded all children of two years and under, to be put to death.
                    Then an angel of the Lord appeared unto Joseph, and said
                    to him, " Arise, and take the Child and His mother, and go to the land of Egypt j and abide there until I tell thee." AndJoseph weut into the land of Egypt.
                    Then Herod began to slay all children, until he had not left one. And he died of an evil death. After his death an angel of the Lord appeared unto Josephin the land of Egypt. And Joseph came up out of Egypt,and dwelt at Nazareth, he, the child, and Mary His mother.
                    And they abode at Jerusalem until Christ was thirty years of
                    age, and was baptized by John.
                    This John lived all his days in the wilderness, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
                    And in the nineteenth year of Tiberius, our Lord Christ wascrucified. He died in the body, and was buried, and rose again from among the dead on the third day ; as it is written.
                    And He went down into hell, and saved Adam and Eve, andall their righteous seed, according to His first and firm promise.

                    And thus He fulfilled all tliat the prophets had prophesied
                    concerning Him.
                    He then went up into heaven; whence He will come
                    again with His holy angels, to judge the quick and dead.
                    Unto Him be glory, and thanksgiving, and honour, and
                    power and worship for ever. Amen.
