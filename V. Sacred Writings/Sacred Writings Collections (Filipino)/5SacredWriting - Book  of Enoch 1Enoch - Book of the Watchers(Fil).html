        <!-------------------------------START OF LESSON 1  ------------------------------->
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        
              
                    <p><sup>1</sup> Ang mga salita ng pagpapala ni Enoc, kung saan pinagpala niya ang mga hinirang at matuwid, na mabubuhay sa araw ng kapighatian, kapag ang lahat ng masasama at walang takot sa Diyos ay aalisin.</p>

                    <p><sup>2</sup> At kanyang sinimulan ang kanyang talinghaga at sinabi - Enoc, isang matuwid na tao, na ang mga mata ay binuksan ng Diyos, nakita ang pangitain ng Nag-iisang Banal sa mga kalangitan, na ipinakita sa akin ng mga anghel, at mula sa kanila ay narinig ko ang lahat, at mula sa kanila ay aking naunawaan habang ako ay nakatingin, ngunit hindi para sa henerasyong ito, kundi para sa isang malayong henerasyong darating.</p>

                    <p><sup>3</sup> Patungkol sa mga hinirang ay sinabi ko, at sinimulan ang aking talinghaga patungkol sa kanila:</p>
                         
                    
                    <p> Ang Nag-iisang Dakilang Banal ay lalabas mula sa Kanyang tirahan,
                    </p> <br>

                    <p><sup>4</sup> At ang walang hanggang Diyos ay bababa sa lupa, (maging) sa Bundok ng Sinai, <br>
                    [At magpapakita mula sa Kanyang kampo] <br>
                    At magpapakita sa kapangyarihan ng Kanyang lakas mula sa kalangitan ng mga kalangitan.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>5</sup> At lahat ay masisindak sa takot <br>
                    At ang mga Tagapagbantay(Watchers) ay mangangatog, <br>
                    At ang malaking takot at panginginig ay sasakop sa kanila hanggang sa mga dulo ng lupa.</p>
             
                    
                    <p><sup>6</sup>  At ang matataas na bundok ay mayayanig, <br>
                    At ang matataas na burol ay ibababa, <br>
                    At matutunaw na parang waks sa harap ng apoy.</p>
             
                    
                    <p><sup>7</sup> At ang lupa ay ganap na mahahati, <br>
                    At lahat ng nasa ibabaw ng lupa ay mamamatay, <br>
                    At magkakaroon ng paghuhukom sa lahat ng tao.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>8</sup> Ngunit makikipagkasundo Siya sa mga matuwid.</p>
                    
                    <p> At poprotektahan Niya ang mga hinirang, <br>
                    At ang awa Niya ay mapapasakanila.</p>
                    
                    <p> At silang lahat ay magiging sa Diyos, <br>
                    At sila ay magtatagumpay, <br>
                    At silang lahat ay pagpapalain.</p>
                    
                    <p>At tutulungan Niya silang lahat, <br>
                    At ang liwanag ay lilitaw sa kanila, <br>
                    At maghahari ang kapayapaan sa kanila.</p>
                 
                    
                    <p><sup>9</sup> At narito! Siya ay dumarating na kasama ang sampung libo ng Kanyang mga banal <br>
                    Upang ipatupad ang paghuhukom sa lahat, <br>
                    At upang lipulin ang lahat ng walang takot sa Diyos:</p>
                    
                    <p>At upang husgahan ang lahat ng laman <br>
                    Sa lahat ng mga gawa ng kanilang kasamaan na kanilang masamang isinakatuparan, <br>
                    At sa lahat ng masasakit na salitang binitawan laban sa Kanya ng mga makasalanang walang takot sa Diyos. </p>

                    

                    <p class="note"><i>v. 3-9 Ito ay isang salaysay mula sa mga pangyayari sa Bundok Sinai na kinasasangkutan ng mga Israelita, Moises, at Diyos, hanggang sa panahon ng paghuhukom, kung saan ihihiwalay ang mga matuwid at mga hinirang upang dalhin sa walang hanggang kapayapaan sa tahanan ng Diyos, samantalang parurusahan ang mga masasama na sumuway sa Diyos.</i> </p>

                    <p class="note"><i>v. 5 Watchers o Tagapagbantay - sila ay mga anghel na itinalaga ng Diyos upang mangasiwa sa mga gawain ng sangkatauhan.</i></p>

                             
        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> Obserbahan ninyo ang lahat ng nagaganap sa kalangitan, kung paano hindi nagbabago ang kanilang mga galaw, at ang mga tala at bituin sa kalangitan, kung paanong sila ay sumisikat at lumulubog nang may kaayusan, bawat isa sa takdang panahon, at hindi sila sumusuway sa itinakdang pagkakasunod-sunod.</p>

                    <p><sup>2</sup> Masdan ninyo ang lupa, at bigyang pansin ang mga kaganapan mula sa simula hanggang wakas, kung gaano sila katatag, kung paanong wala ni isa sa mga bagay sa lupa ang nagbabago, kundi lahat ng gawa ng Diyos ay nahahayag sa inyo.</p> 

                    <p><sup>3</sup> Masdan ninyo ang tag-init at taglamig, kung paanong ang buong lupa ay napupuno ng tubig, at ang mga ulap, hamog, at ulan ay bumabalot dito.</p>
                    
                    
        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> Obserbahan at tingnan kung paano sa taglamig, ang lahat ng mga puno ay tila nalalanta at nalalagasan ng dahon, maliban sa labing-apat na puno na hindi nawawalan ng mga dahon, kundi pinananatili ang mga lumang dahon sa loob ng dalawa hanggang tatlong taon hanggang dumating ang mga bago.</p>
                    
                    
        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> Muli, obserbahan ninyo ang mga araw ng tag-init, kung paanong ang araw ay nasa itaas at matinding sumisinag sa lupa.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> Hinahanap ninyo ang lilim at kanlungan dahil sa tindi ng init ng araw, at pati ang lupa ay nasusunog dahil sa matinding init, kaya’t hindi ninyo matapakan ang lupa o ang bato dahil sa tindi ng init nito.
                    </p>
                    
        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> Obserbahan ninyo kung paano ang mga puno ay nababalot ng mga berdeng dahon at nagbubunga; kaya’t bigyang-pansin ninyo at kilalanin ang lahat ng Kanyang mga gawa, at kilalanin na ang Nabubuhay magpakailanman ang lumikha ng mga ito.</p> 

                    <p><sup>2</sup> At lahat ng Kanyang mga gawa ay nagpapatuloy taon-taon hanggang magpakailanman, at lahat ng mga gawain na kanilang natatapos para sa Kanya, ay hindi nagbabago; ayon sa itinakda ng Diyos, ganoon ito nagaganap.</p>

                    <p><sup>3</sup> Masdan ninyo kung paanong ang dagat at mga ilog ay tumutupad ng kanilang mga gawain ayon sa Kanyang mga utos at hindi sila nagbabago.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>4</sup> Ngunit kayo—hindi kayo naging matatag, ni sumunod sa mga kautusan ng Panginoon. <br>
                    Sa halip, kayo'y tumalikod at nagsalita ng may pagmamataas at masasakit na salita <br>
                    gamit ang inyong mga maruruming bibig laban sa Kanyang kadakilaan. <br>
                    O kayong mga matitigas ang puso, hindi kayo makakasumpong ng kapayapaan.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>5</sup> Kaya’t susumpain ninyo ang inyong mga araw, <br>
                    at ang mga taon ng inyong buhay ay mawawala, <br>
                    at ang mga taon ng inyong pagkawasak ay lalong titindi sa walang hanggang sumpa, <br>
                    at hindi kayo makakasumpong ng Aking awa.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>6</sup>  Sa mga araw na iyon, ang inyong mga pangalan ay magiging walang hanggang sumpa sa lahat ng mga matuwid, <br>
                    at sa pamamagitan ninyo, isusumpa ng lahat ng sumusumpa, <br>
                    at ang lahat ng makasalanan at walang Diyos ay magsusumpa laban sa inyo, <br>
                    at para sa inyo, ang walang Diyos ay magkakaroon ng sumpa.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>7</sup> At ang lahat ng mga... ay magagalak, <br>
                    at magkakaroon ng kapatawaran ng mga kasalanan, <br>
                    at bawat awa, kapayapaan, at pagtitiis: <br>
                    magkakaroon ng kaligtasan para sa kanila, isang maningning na liwanag.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p> At para sa inyong mga makasalanan, wala kayong matatamong kaligtasan, <br>
                    ngunit sa inyo ay mananatili ang sumpa. <br>
                    Ngunit para sa mga hinirang, magkakaroon ng liwanag, kagalakan, at kapayapaan <br>
                    at mamanahin nila ang lupa.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>8</sup> At sa mga hinirang ay ipagkakaloob ang karunungan, at sila'y mabubuhay at hindi na muling magkakasala,  <br>
                    maging sa kawalang-Diyos o pagmamataas: <br>
                    ngunit ang mga marurunong ay magiging mapagpakumbaba.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>9</sup> At hindi na sila muling susuway, <br>
                    ni magkakasala sa lahat ng mga araw ng kanilang buhay, <br>
                    ni mamamatay sa (banal na) galit o poot, <br>
                    ngunit tatapusin nila ang bilang ng mga araw ng kanilang buhay.</p>
                    
                    <p>At ang kanilang mga buhay ay madaragdagan sa kapayapaan, <br>
                    at ang mga taon ng kanilang kagalakan ay dadami, <br>
                    sa walang hanggang kagalakan at kapayapaan, <br>
                    sa lahat ng mga araw ng kanilang buhay.</p>

                    <p class="note"><i>v. 7-9 Ang kaligtasang tinutukoy dito ay ang kabuuang kaligtasan ng mga banal at matutuwid, na kasama ng Diyos sa Kanyang Paraiso, kung saan nariyan ang Kanyang liwanag. Sa kabilang banda, ang mga makasalanan ay itatapon sa dagat-dagatang apoy. <br>

                    Binanggit din na ang mga banal at matutuwid ay mamanahin ang lupa, na nangangahulugang itinatama ng sulat ni Enoch ang karaniwang turo o maling pananaw, na ang mga Kristiyano ay maninirahan sa langit. Ayon sa Pahayag, ang templo ng Diyos, na siyang Bagong Jerusalem, ay bumababa mula sa langit, at ang Diyos ay makakasama ng mga tao sa kanilang kalagitnaan, at ang mga matutuwid ay hindi na muling tatalikod o magkakasala man.

         <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
                    
                    
                <p><sup>1</sup> Nangyari nga, nang dumami ang mga anak ng tao, na sa mga araw na iyon ay ipinanganak sa kanila ang magaganda at kaakit-akit na mga anak na babae.</p> 

                <p><sup>2</sup> At nakita sila ng mga anghel, ang mga anak ng kalangitan, at pinagnasaan nila ang mga ito, at sinabi nila sa isa’t isa: "Halikayo, pumili tayo ng mga asawa mula sa mga anak ng tao at magkaanak tayo."</p> 

                <p><sup>3</sup> At sinabi sa kanila ni Semjaza, ang kanilang pinuno: "Natatakot ako na hindi ninyo pag-isahan na gawin ang gawaing ito, at ako lamang ang mananagot para sa malaking kasalanan na gagawin."</p> 

                <p><sup>4</sup> At lahat sila’y sumagot sa kanya at nagsabi: "Tayo ay manumpa, at magbigkis ng sumpa sa isa’t isa na huwag talikuran ang balak na ito, kundi gawin natin ito."</p>

                <p><sup>5</sup> Kaya’t silang lahat ay nanumpa at nagbigkis ng sumpa sa isa’t isa.</p>

                <p><sup>6</sup> Sila'y lahat dalawang daan na bumaba sa mga araw ni Jared sa tuktok ng Bundok Hermon, at tinawag nila itong Bundok Hermon, sapagkat sila’y nanumpa at nagbigkis ng sumpa sa isa’t isa dito.</p> 

                <p><sup>7</sup> At ito ang mga pangalan ng kanilang mga pinuno: Samlazaz, ang kanilang pinuno, Araklba, Rameel, Kokablel, Tamlel, Ramlel, Danel, Ezeqeel, Baraqijal, Asael, Armaros, Batarel, Ananel, Zaqiel, Samsapeel, Satarel, Turel, Jomjael, Sariel. Ito ang kanilang mga pinuno ng bawat sampu.</p>


                <p>v. 1-2 tignan to Genesis 6:1-2, 4 MBBTAG12 <br><br>
                
                <sup>1</sup> Napakarami na ng mga tao sa daigdig nang panahong iyon. Nagkaroon sila ng mga anak na babae. 
                <sup>2</sup> Nang makita ng mga anak ng Diyos na ang mga babaing anak ng tao ay magaganda, ang mga ito'y pumili sa kanila ng kanya-kanyang asawa. 
                <sup>4</sup> Nang panahong iyon, may mga higante sa ibabaw ng lupa. Sila ang naging bunga ng pakikipagtalik ng mga anak ng Diyos sa mga anak ng tao. Ang mga higanteng iyon ay tinanghal na mga dakilang bayani at tanyag na tao noong unang panahon.
                    </p>

                <p class="note"><i>v. 6 Ang Bundok Hermon, na ang paanan ay kilala noong panahon ng Panginoong Hesus bilang Cesarea Filipos, ay kung saan sinabi ng Panginoon, "Sa batong ito ay itatayo ko ang aking Iglesia, at ang kapangyarihan ng Impiyerno ay hindi magtatagumpay laban dito." (Tingnan ang Mateo 16:13-20). Ang Bundok Hermon din ang lugar kung saan unang bumaba ang mga nagkasalang anghel na tumalikod sa Diyos at nagturo ng mga kasuklam-suklam na gawain sa sangkatauhan noong panahon ni Jared, na naging dahilan upang wasakin ng Diyos ang mundo sa pamamagitan ng malaking baha. Bukod dito, ang Bundok Hermon ay naging sentro ng pagsamba sa mga diyus-diyosan mula sa pagtalikod ng Israel hanggang sa panahon ng Panginoon. Kaya’t ang pahayag ng Panginoon sa lugar na ito ay isang tuwirang pagdedeklara ng labanan sa pagitan ng katuwiran, sa ilalim ng Kanyang pamumuno, at ng mga puwersa ng kasamaan, na Kanyang binigkas mismo sa paanan ng Bundok Hermon kung saan kinikilala din na bukana ng Impiyerno. </i></p>

                <p><sup>1</sup> At ang lahat ng iba pang kasama nila ay kumuha ng mga asawa para sa kanilang sarili, at bawat isa ay pumili ng isa, at sinimulan nilang makisama sa kanila at lapastanganin ang kanilang sarili sa kanila, at tinuruan nila sila ng mga panggayuma at mahika, at ang pagputol ng mga ugat, at pinakilala sa kanila ang mga halaman.</p>

                <p><sup>2</sup>  At sila’y nabuntis, at nanganak ng malalaking higante, na ang taas ay tatlong libong siko, na kumonsumo ng lahat ng tinipon ng mga tao.</p>

                <p><sup>3</sup> At nang hindi na kayang suportahan sila ng mga tao, ang mga higante ay bumaling laban sa kanila at kinain ang sangkatauhan. Sila ay nagsimulang magkasala laban sa mga ibon, mga hayop, mga reptilya, at mga isda, at nagsimulang kainin ang laman ng isa’t isa at inumin ang dugo.</p> 

                <p><sup>4</sup> Pagkatapos ay nag-akusa ang lupa laban sa mga gawain ng mga suwail.</p>

                <p class="note"><i>v. 1 Ibig sabihin, tinuruan nila ang kanilang mga asawa ng iba't ibang uri ng itim na mahika, pangkukulam, at iba pang mga gawain na kasuklam-suklam sa paningin ng Diyos.</i></p>

                <p class="note"><i>v. 2 Mga Higante o Nephilim: Kung ang mga higante noong panahon ng mga Israelita, nang sakupin nila ang Canaan, ay katulad ng mga inilalarawan sa larawan sa ibaba, ang mga higante bago ang baha ay mas malalaki kumpara sa mga higante pagkatapos ng baha. Kung ang mga higante noong panahon ng mga Israelita ay umaabot sa taas na 11 o 12 metro (mga 36 na talampakan), mas maliit pa rin sila kumpara sa mga higante bago ang baha. Ayon sa mga sukat na ibinigay sa Aklat ni Enoc, ang taas nila ay umaabot sa 3,429 metro o 3,000 siko. Ang pinakamataas na bundok sa mundo, ang Mount Everest, ay may taas na 8,849 metro, habang ang lalim ng Baha ni Noah ay umabot ng humigit-kumulang 8,856 metro basehan sa higit sa 7 metro mula sa pinakamataas na bundok. Ang napakalaking lalim na ito ay kinakailangan upang matiyak na pati ang mga higante noong panahon ni Noah ay malulunod at mamamatay. </i></p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> At si Azazel ay nagturo sa mga tao kung paano gumawa ng mga espada, mga kutsilyo, mga kalasag, at mga baluti, at ipinakilala sa kanila ang mga metal ng lupa at ang sining ng pagproseso nito, at mga pulseras, at mga palamuti, at ang paggamit ng antimonyo, at ang pagpapaganda ng mga talukap ng mata, at lahat ng uri ng mamahaling bato, at lahat ng kulay ng mga pangkulay.</p>

		                <p><sup>2</sup> At lumaganap ang matinding kawalang-Diyos, at sila’y nagkasala ng pakikiapid, at sila’y nailigaw, at naging tiwali sa lahat ng kanilang mga gawa.</p>
                   
		                <p><sup>3</sup> Si Semjaza ay nagturo ng panggagaway at pagputol ng mga ugat, si Armaros ng paggawa ng mga panggagaway, si Baraqijal ng astrologiya, si Kokabel ng mga konstelasyon, si Ezeqeel ng kaalaman sa mga ulap, si Araqiel ng mga tanda sa lupa, si Shamsiel ng mga tanda ng araw, at si Sariel ng galaw ng buwan.</p>

		                <p><sup>4</sup> At habang ang ibang mga tao ay namamatay, sila ay sumigaw, at ang kanilang iyak ay umabot sa kalangitan.</p>

                    <p><sup>4</sup> At sinabi nila sa Panginoon ng mga panahon: "Panginoon ng mga panginoon, Diyos ng mga diyos, Hari ng mga hari, at Diyos ng mga panahon, ang trono ng Inyong kaluwalhatian ay nananatili sa lahat ng henerasyon ng mga kapanahunan, at ang Inyong pangalan ay banal, maluwalhati, at pinagpala sa lahat ng panahon!</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> Then said the Most High, the Holy and Great One spake, and sent Uriel to the son of Lamech, and said to him: Go to Noah and tell him in my name &quot;Hide thyself!&quot; and reveal to him the end that is approaching: that the whole earth will be destroyed, and a deluge is about to come upon the whole earth, and will destroy all that is on it.</p> 

		                <p><sup>2</sup> And now instruct him that he may escape and his seed may be preserved for all the generations of the world.</p> 

		                <p><sup>3</sup> And again the Lord said to Raphael: Bind Azazel hand and foot, and cast him into the darkness: and make an opening in the desert, which is in Dudael, and cast him therein.</p> 

		                <p><sup>4</sup> And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there for ever, and cover his face that he may,not see light.  And on the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the fire.</p>

		                <p><sup>5</sup> And heal the earth which the angels have corrupted, and proclaim the healing of the earth, that they may heal the plague, and that all the children of men may not perish through all the secret things that the Watchers
                    have disclosed and have taught their sons.</p>

		                <p><sup>6</sup> And the whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azazel: to him ascribe all sin.</p>

		                <p><sup>7</sup> And to Gabriel said the Lord: Proceed against the bastards and the reprobates, and against the children of fornication: and destroy [the children of fornication and] the children of the Watchers from amongst men [and cause them to go forth]: send them one against the other that they may destroy each other in battle: for length of days shall they not have.</p> 

		                <p><sup>8</sup> And no request that they (i.e. their fathers) make of thee shall be granted unto their fathers on
                    their behalf; for they hope to live an eternal life, and that each one of them will live five hundred years.</p>

		                <p><sup>9</sup> And the Lord said unto Michael: Go, bind Semjaza and his associates who have united themselves with women so as to have defiled themselves with them in all their uncleanness.</p> 

		                <p><sup>10</sup> And when their sons have slain one another, and they have seen the destruction of their beloved ones, bind them fast for seventy generations in the valleys of the earth, till the day of their judgement and of their consummation, till the judgement that is for ever and ever is consummated.</p> 

		                <p><sup>11</sup> In those days they shall be led off to the abyss of fire: and to the torment and the prison in which they shall be confined for ever.</p> 

		                <p><sup>12</sup> And whosoever shall be condemned and destroyed will from thenceforth be bound together with them to the end of all generations.</p>  

		                <p><sup>13</sup> And destroy all the spirits of the reprobate and the children of the Watchers, because they have wronged mankind.</p>

                    <p><sup>14</sup> Destroy all wrong from the face of the earth and let every evil work come to an end: and let the plant of righteousness and truth appear: and it shall prove a blessing; the works of righteousness and truth shall be planted in truth and joy for evermore.</p>
                    
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And then shall all the righteous escape, <br>
                    And shall live till they beget thousands of children, <br>
                    And all the days of their youth and their old age <br>
                    Shall they complete in peace.</p>

                    <p><sup>17</sup></p> And all desirable trees shall be planted on it, and they shall plant vines on it: and the vine which they plant thereon shall yield wine in abundance, and as for all the seed which is sown thereon each measure (of it) shall bear a thousand, and each measure of olives shall yield ten presses of oil.</p>
		    
                    <p><sup>18</sup> And cleanse thou the earth from all oppression, and from all unrighteousness, and from all sin, and from all godlessness: and all the uncleanness that is wrought upon the earth destroy from off the earth. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>19</sup></p> And all the children of men shall become righteous, and all nations shall offer adoration and shall praise Me, and all shall worship Me.</p>

		                <p><sup>20</sup> And the earth shall be cleansed from all defilement, and from all sin, and from all punishment, and from all torment, and I will never again send (them) upon it from generation to generation and for ever.</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> Before these things Enoch was hidden, and no one of the children of men knew where he was hidden, and where he abode, and what had become of him. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And his activities had to do with the Watchers, and his days were with the holy ones.</p> 
		
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And I Enoch was blessing the Lord of majesty and the King of the ages, and lo! the Watchers called me -Enoch the scribe- and said to me: 'Enoch, thou scribe of righteousness, go, declare to the Watchers of the heaven who have left the high heaven, the holy eternal place, and have defiled themselves with women, and have done as the children of earth do, and have taken unto themselves wives: &quot;Ye have wrought great destruction on the earth: And ye shall have no peace nor forgiveness of sin: and inasmuch as they delight themselves in their children, The murder of their beloved ones shall they see, and over the destruction of their children shall they lament, and shall make supplication unto eternity, but mercy and peace shall ye not attain.&quot;</p>
                    
                    
        <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And Enoch went and said: Azazel, thou shalt have no peace: a severe sentence has gone forth against thee to put thee in bonds: And thou shalt not have toleration nor request granted to thee, because of the  unrighteousness which thou hast taught, and because of all the works of godlessness and unrighteousness and sin which thou hast shown to men.</p> 

		                <p><sup>2</sup> Then I went and spoke to them all together, and they were all afraid, and fear and trembling seized them. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>3</sup>
                    And they besought me to draw up a petition for them that they might find forgiveness, and to read their petition in the presence of the Lord of heaven.</p>

                    <p><sup>4</sup> For from thenceforward they could not speak (with Him) nor lift up their eyes to heaven for shame of their sins for which they had been condemned.</p> 

		                <p><sup>5</sup> Then I wrote out their petition, and the prayer in regard to their spirits and their deeds  individually and in regard to their requests that they should have forgiveness and length.</p>

		                <p><sup>6</sup> And I went off and sat down at the waters of Dan, in the land of Dan, to the south of the west of Hermon: I read their petition till I fell asleep.</p>

		                <p><sup>7</sup> And behold a dream came to me, and visions fell down upon me, and I saw visions of chastisement, and a voice came bidding (me) I to tell it to the sons of heaven, and reprimand them.</p>

		                <p><sup>8</sup> And when I awaked, I came unto them, and they were all sitting gathered together, weeping in Abelsjail, which is between Lebanon and Seneser, with their faces covered.</p>

		                <p><sup>9</sup> And I recounted before them all the visions which I had seen in sleep, and I began to speak the words of righteousness, and to reprimand the heavenly Watchers.</p>
                    
                    
         <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> The book of the words of righteousness, and of the reprimand of the eternal Watchers in accordance with the command of the Holy Great One in that vision. </p>
                     
                    <p><sup>2</sup> I saw in my sleep what I will now say with a tongue of flesh and with the breath of my mouth: which the
                    Great One has given to men to converse therewith and understand with the heart.</p> 

                    <p><sup>3</sup> As He has created and given to man the power of understanding the word of wisdom, so hath He created me also and given me the power of reprimanding the Watchers, the children of heaven.</p> 

		                <p><sup>4</sup> I wrote out your petition, and in my vision it appeared thus, that your petition will not be granted unto you throughout all the days of eternity, and that judgement has been finally passed upon you: yea (your petition) will not be granted unto you.</p>
 
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And from henceforth you shall not ascend into heaven unto all eternity, and in bonds of the earth the decree has gone forth to bind you for all the days of the world.</p> 
                    
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And (that) previously you shall have seen the destruction of your beloved sons and ye shall have no
                    pleasure in them, but they shall fall before you by the sword.</p>
 
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And your petition on their behalf shall not be granted, nor yet on your own: even though you weep and pray and speak all the words contained in the writing which I have written.</p>
 
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And the vision was shown to me thus: Behold, in the vision clouds invited me and a mist summoned me,  and the course of the stars and the lightnings sped and hastened me, and the winds in the vision caused me to fly and lifted me upward, and bore me into heaven.</p> 
		 
		                <p><sup>9</sup> And I went in till I drew nigh to a wall which is built of crystals and surrounded by tongues of fire: and it began to affright me.</p> 

		                <p><sup>10</sup> And I went into the tongues of fire and drew nigh to a large house which was built of crystals: and the walls of the house were like a tesselated floor (made) of crystals, and its groundwork was of crystal.</p>
		
		                <p><sup>11</sup> Its ceiling was like the path of the stars and the lightnings, and between them were fiery cherubim, and their heaven was (clear as) water. A flaming fire surrounded the walls, and its portals blazed with fire.</p> 
		
		                <p><sup>12</sup> And I entered into that house, and it was hot as fire and cold as ice: there were no delights of life therein: fear covered me, and trembling got hold upon me. And as I quaked and trembled, I fell upon my face.</p> 

		                <p><sup>13</sup> And I beheld a vision, And lo! there was a second house, greater than the former, and the entire portal stood open before me, and it was built of flames of fire.</p>

		                <p><sup>14</sup> And in every respect it so excelled in splendour and magnificence and extent that I cannot describe to you its splendour and its extent.</p> 
                    
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And its floor was of fire, and above it were lightnings and the path of the stars, and its ceiling also was flaming fire.</p> 

		                <p><sup>16</sup> And I looked and saw therein a lofty throne: its appearance was as crystal, and the wheels thereof as the shining sun, and there was the vision of cherubim.</p> 

		                <p><sup>17</sup> And from underneath the throne came streams of flaming fire so that I could not look thereon. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>18</sup> And the Great Glory sat thereon, and His raiment shone more brightly than the sun and was whiter than any snow.</p> 

		                <p><sup>19</sup> None of the angels could enter and could behold His face by reason of the magnificence and glory and no flesh could behold Him. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>20</sup> The flaming fire was round about Him, and a great fire stood before Him, and none around could draw nigh Him: ten thousand times ten thousand (stood) before Him, yet He needed no counselor.</p> 

		                <p><sup>21</sup> And the most holy ones who were nigh to Him did not leave by night nor depart from Him.</p> 
                    
                    <p><sup>22</sup> And until then I had been prostrate on my face, trembling: and the Lord called me with His own mouth, and said to me: ' Come hither, Enoch, and hear my word.'</p> 
                      
                    <p><sup>23</sup> And one of the holy ones came to me and waked me, and He made me rise up and approach the
                    door: and I bowed my face downwards.</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And He answered and said to me, and I heard His voice: 'Fear not, Enoch, thou righteous man and scribe of righteousness: approach hither and hear my voice. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And go, say to the Watchers of heaven, who have sent thee to intercede for them: &quot;You should
                    intercede&quot; for men, and not men for you: </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>3</sup> Wherefore have ye left the high, holy, and eternal heaven, and lain with women, and defiled yourselves with the daughters of men and taken to yourselves wives, and done like the children of earth, and begotten giants (as
                    your) sons? And though ye were holy, spiritual, living the eternal life, you have defiled yourselves with the blood of women, and have begotten (children) with the blood of flesh, and, as the children of men, have lusted after flesh and blood as those also do who die and perish.</p> 

		                <p><sup>4</sup> Therefore have I given them wives also that they might impregnate them, and beget children by them, that thus nothing might be wanting to them on earth.</p>
 
                    <p><sup>5</sup> But you were formerly spiritual, living the eternal life, and immortal for all generations of the world. And therefore I have not appointed wives for you; for as for the spiritual ones of the heaven, in heaven is their dwelling.</p>

 		                <p><sup>6</sup> And now, the giants, who are produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling.</p> 

		                <p><sup>7</sup> Evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from men and from the holy Watchers is their beginning and primal origin; they shall be evil spirits on earth, and evil spirits shall they be called.</p> 


                    <p><sup>8</sup> [As for the spirits of heaven, in heaven shall be their dwelling, but as for the spirits of the earth which were born upon the earth, on the earth shall be their dwelling.]</p>

		                <p><sup>4</sup> I saw the winds of heaven which turn and bring the circumference of the sun and all the stars to their setting. </p>

                    <p><sup>10</sup> And beyond these mountains is a region the end of the great earth: there the heavens were completed.</p>

                    <p><sup>11</sup> And I saw a deep abyss, with columns of heavenly fire, and among them I saw columns of fire fall, which were beyond measure alike towards the height and towards the depth. </p>

                    <p><sup>6</sup> Saraqael, one of the holy angels, who is set over the spirits, who sin in the spirit.</p> 

		                <p><sup>7</sup> Gabriel, one of the holy angels, who is over Paradise and the serpents and the Cherubim.</p> 

		                <p><sup>8</sup> Remiel, one of the holy angels, whom God set over those who rise.</p>

                    <p><sup>2</sup> And I saw there something horrible: I saw neither a heaven above nor a firmly founded earth, but a place chaotic and horrible.</p>

                    <p><sup>3</sup> And there I saw seven stars of the heaven bound together in it, like great mountains and burning with fire.</p>
                    
                    <p><sup>4</sup> Then I said: 'For what sin are they bound, and on what account have they been cast in hither?' </p>

		                <p><sup>5</sup> Then said Uriel, one of the holy angels, who was with me, and was chief over them, and said: </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>6</sup> 'Enoch, why dost thou ask, and why art thou eager for the truth? </p>

                    <p><sup>9</sup> and I saw a horrible thing: a great fire there which burnt and blazed, and the place was cleft as far as the abyss, being full of great descending columns of fire: neither its extent or magnitude could I see, nor could I conjecture.</p>

                    <p><sup>10</sup> Then I said: 'How fearful is the place and how terrible to look upon!'</p> 
                    
                    <p><sup>11</sup> Then Uriel answered me, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said unto me: 'Enoch, why hast
                    thou such fear and affright?'</p> 

		                <p><sup>12</sup> And I answered: 'Because of this fearful place, and because of the spectacle of the pain.' And he said unto me: </p>

                    <p><sup>2</sup> And there was in it four hollow places, deep and wide and very smooth. How smooth are the hollow places and deep and dark to look at.</p> 

		                <p><sup>3</sup> Then Raphael answered, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said unto me: </p>

                    'These hollow places have been created for this very purpose, that the spirits of the souls of the dead should assemble therein, yea that all the souls of the children of men should assemble here. </p>

		                <p><sup>6</sup> I saw (the spirit of) a dead man making suit, and his voice went forth to heaven and made suit. And I asked Raphael the angel who was with me, and I said unto him:</p> 
                    
                    <p><sup>7</sup> 'This spirit which maketh suit, whose is it, whose voice goeth forth and maketh suit to heaven ?'</p> 
 
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And he answered me saying: 'This is the spirit which went forth from Abel, whom his brother Cain slew, and he makes his suit against him till his seed is destroyed from the face of the earth, and his seed is annihilated from amongst the seed of men.'</p> 

		                <p><sup>9</sup> Then I asked regarding it, and regarding all the hollow places: 'Why is one separated from the other?'</p> 

                    <p><sup>10</sup> And he answered me and said unto me: 'These three have been made that the spirits of the dead might be
                    separated.</p>

		                <p><sup>14</sup> And such a division has been made for the spirits of those who make their suit, who make disclosures concerning their destruction, when they were slain in the days of the sinners.</p> 

		                <p><sup>15</sup> Such has been made for the spirits of men who were not righteous but sinners, who were complete in transgression, and of the transgressors they shall be companions: but their spirits shall not be slain in the day of

                    but (ran) regularly.</p> 

		                <p><sup>3</sup> And I asked saying: 'What is this which rests not?' Then Raguel, one of the holy angels who was with me, answered me and said unto me: </p>

		                <p><sup>2</sup> And I went beyond it and saw seven magnificent mountains all differing each from the other, and the stones (thereof) were magnificent and beautiful, magnificent as a whole, of glorious appearance and fair exterior: </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>3</sup> three towards the east, one founded on the other, and three towards the south, one upon the other, and
                    deep rough ravines, no one of which joined with any other.</p>

         <h2>Chapter 28</h2>
                   
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And thence I went towards the east, into the midst of the mountain range of the desert, and I saw a wilderness and it was solitary, full of trees and plants.</p>
 
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And water gushed forth from above. Rushing like a copious watercourse [which flowed] towards the
                    north-west it caused clouds and dew to ascend on every side.</p>
                   
                    
         <h2>Chapter 29</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And thence I went to another place in the desert, and approached to the east of this mountain range. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And there I saw aromatic trees exhaling the fragrance of frankincense and myrrh, and the trees also were similar to the almond tree.</p>
                 
                    
         <h2>Chapter 30</h2>
                   
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And beyond these, I went afar to the east, and I saw another place, a valley (full) of water. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And therein there was a tree, the colour of fragrant trees such as the mastic.</p> 
                    
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And on the sides of those valleys I saw fragrant cinnamon. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And beyond these I proceeded to the east.</p>
                  
                    
         <h2>Chapter 31</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And I saw other mountains, and amongst them were groves of trees, and there flowed forth from them nectar, which is named sarara and galbanum. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And beyond these mountains I saw another mountain to the east of the ends of the earth, whereon were aloe-trees, and all the trees were full of stacte, being like almond-trees. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And when one burnt it, it smelt sweeter than any fragrant odour.</p>
             
                    
         <h2>Chapter 32</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And after these fragrant odours, as I looked towards the north over the mountains I saw seven mountains full of choice nard and fragrant trees and cinnamon and pepper. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And thence I went over the summits of all these mountains, far towards the east of the earth,
                    and passed above the Erythraean sea and went far from it, and passed over the angel Zotiel.</p> 

		                <p><sup>3</sup> And I came to the Garden of Righteousness, I and from afar off trees more numerous than I these trees and great-two trees there, very great, beautiful, and glorious, and magnificent, and the tree of knowledge, whose holy fruit they eat and know great wisdom.</p> 

		                <p><sup>4</sup> That tree is in height like the fir, and its leaves are like (those of) the Carob tree: and its fruit is like the clusters of the vine, very beautiful: and the fragrance of the tree penetrates afar.</p> 

		                <p><sup>5</sup> Then I said: 'How beautiful is the tree, and how attractive is its look!'</p> 

		                <p><sup>6</sup> Then Raphael the holy angel, who was with me, answered me and said: </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>7</sup>
                    'This is the tree of wisdom, of which thy father old (in years) and thy aged mother, who were before thee, have eaten, and they learnt wisdom and their eyes were opened, and they knew that they were naked and they were driven out of the garden.'</p>
                   
                    
         <h2>Chapter 33</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And from thence I went to the ends of the earth and saw there great beasts, and each differed from the other; and (I saw) birds also differing in appearance and beauty and voice, the one differing from the other. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And to the east of those beasts I saw the ends of the earth whereon the heaven rests, and the portals of the heaven open.</p>

                    <p><sup>3</sup> And I saw how the stars of heaven come forth, and I counted the portals out of which they proceed, and wrote down all their outlets, of each individual star by itself, according to their number and their names, their courses and their positions, and their times and their months, as Uriel the holy angel who was with me showed me.</p>
 
                    <p><sup>4</sup> He showed all things to me and wrote them down for me: also their names he wrote for me, and their laws
                    and their companies.</p>
                  
                    
         <h2>Chapter 34</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And from thence I went towards the north to the ends of the earth, and there I saw a great and glorious device at the ends of the whole earth. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And here I saw three portals of heaven open in the heaven: through each of them proceed north winds: when they blow there is cold, hail, frost, snow, dew, and rain. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And out of one portal they blow for good: but when they blow through the other two portals, it is with violence and affliction on the earth, and they blow with violence.</p>
                  
                    
         <h2>Chapter 35</h2>
                  
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And from thence I went towards the west to the ends of the earth, and saw there three portals of the heaven open such as I had seen in the east, the same number of portals, and the same number of outlets.</p>
                    
                    
         <h2>Chapter 36</h2>
                   
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And from thence I went to the south to the ends of the earth, and saw there three open portals of the heaven: and thence there come dew, rain, and wind. </p>
                    
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And from thence I went to the east to the ends of the heaven, and saw here the three eastern
                    portals of heaven open and small portals above them.</p>
			
		                <p><sup>3</sup> Through each of these small portals pass the stars of heaven and run their course to the west on the path which is shown to them.</p> 

		                <p><sup>4</sup> And as often as I saw I blessed always the Lord of Glory, and I continued to bless the Lord of Glory who has wrought great and glorious wonders, to show the greatness of His work to the angels and to spirits and to men, that they might praise His work and all His creation: that they might see the work of His might and praise the great
                    work of His hands and bless Him for ever.</p>
