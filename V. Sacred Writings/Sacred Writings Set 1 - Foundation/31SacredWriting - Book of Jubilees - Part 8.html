<p class="chapterTitle">How to compute Jubilee years</p>
<p>
1 Jubilee  = 7 weeks <br>
1 Week     = 7 years <br>
1 Jubilee  = 49 years
</p>
<p>Sample Computation:</p>
<p>There are 49 Jubilees, 2 weeks and 2 years from Adam to the 40 days of Moses on Mt. Sinai.</p>
<p>
49 jubilees x 49 years / jubilee =    2401 years <br>
7 weeks x 7 years / week ----- =    49 years <br>
2 years------------------------- =     2  years 
</p>

<p>2,401 years + 49 years + 2 years = 2410 years from Adam to Mt Sinai when the Law was given to Moses </p>

    <H2>Chapter 1</H2>

          <p class="chapterTitle"> Expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael, 1-14. Mast&ecirc;m&acirc; proposes that God should require Abraham to sacrifice Isaac in order to test his love and obedience: Abraham's ten trials, 15-18. (Cf. Gen.xxi.8-21.)</p>
                                                                        
                

                  
                <p><sup>1</sup>And in the first year of the fifth week Isaac was weaned in this jubilee, [1982 A.M.] and Abraham made a great banquet in the third month, on the day his son Isaac was weaned.</p> 
                <p><sup>2</sup>And Ishmael, the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, was before the face of Abraham, his father, in his place, and Abraham rejoiced and blessed God because he had seen his sons and had not died childless.</p> 
                <p><sup>3</sup>And he remembered the words which He had spoken to him on the day on which Lot had parted from him, and he rejoiced because the Lord had given him seed upon the earth to inherit the earth, and he blessed with all his mouth the Creator of all things.</p> 
                <p><sup>4</sup>And Sarah saw Ishmael playing and dancing, and Abraham rejoicing with great joy, and she became jealous of Ishmael and said to Abraham, 'Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman will not be heir with my son, Isaac.'</p> 
                <p><sup>5</sup>And the thing was grievous in Abraham's sight, because of his maidservant and because of his son, that he should drive them from him.</p> 
                <p><sup>6</sup>And God said to Abraham 'Let it not be grievous in thy sight, because of the child and because of the bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, harken to her words and do (them); for in Isaac shall thy name and seed be called.</p> 
                <p><sup>7</sup>But as for the son of this bondwoman I will make him a great nation, because he is of thy seed.'</p> 
                <p><sup>8</sup>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and placed them on the shoulders of Hagar and the child, and sent her away.</p> 
                <p><sup>9</sup> And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba, and the water in the bottle was spent, and the child thirsted, and was not able to go on, and fell down.</p> 
                <p><sup>10</sup>And his mother took him and cast him under an olive tree, and went and sat her down over against him, at the distance of a bow-shot; for she said, 'Let me not see the death of my child,' and as she sat she wept.</p> 
                <p><sup>11</sup>And an angel of God, one of the holy ones, said unto her, 'Why weepest thou, Hagar?  Arise take the child, and hold him in thine hand; for God hath heard thy voice, and hath seen the child.'</p> 
                <p><sup>12</sup>And she opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water, and she went and filled her bottle with water, and she gave her child to drink, and she arose and went towards the wilderness of Paran.</p> 
                <p><sup>13</sup>And the child grew and became an archer, and God was with him, and his mother took him a wife from among the daughters of Egypt.</p> 
                <p><sup>14</sup>And she bare him a son, and he called his name Nebaioth; for she said, 'The Lord was nigh to me when I called upon him.'</p> 
                <p><sup>15</sup>And it came to pass in the seventh week, in the first year thereof, [2003 A.M.] in the first month in this jubilee, on the twelfth of this month, there were voices in heaven regarding Abraham, that he was faithful in all that He told him, and that he loved the Lord, and that in every affliction he was faithful.</p> 
                <p><sup>16</sup>And the prince Mast&ecirc;m&acirc; came and said before God, 'Behold, Abraham loves Isaac his son, and he delights in him above all things else; bid him offer him as a burnt-offering on the altar, and Thou wilt see if he will do this command, and Thou wilt know if he is faithful in everything wherein Thou dost try him.</p> 
                <p><sup>17</sup>And the Lord knew that Abraham was faithful in all his afflictions; for He had tried him through his country and with famine, and had tried him with the wealth of kings, and had tried him again through his wife, when she was torn (from him), and with circumcision; and had tried him through Ishmael and Hagar, his maid-servant, when he sent them away.</p> 
                <p><sup>18</sup>And in everything wherein He had tried him, he was found faithful, and his soul was not impatient, and he was not slow to act; for he was faithful and a lover of the Lord.</p>
              
  

    <H2>Chapter 2</H2>

          <p class="chapterTitle"> Sacrifice of Isaac: Mast&ecirc;m&acirc; put to shame, 1-13. Abraham again blessed: returns to Beersheba 14-19. (Cf. Gen. xxii. 1-19.)</p>
                                                                            
                    
                      
                <p><sup>1</sup>And God said to him, 'Abraham, Abraham'; and he said, Behold, (here) am I.'  </p>
                <p><sup>2</sup>And he said, Take thy beloved son whom thou lovest, (even) Isaac, and go unto the high country, and offer him on one of the mountains which I will point out unto thee.' </p>
                <p><sup>3</sup>And he rose early in the morning and saddled his ass, and took his two young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood of the burnt offering, and he went to the place on the third day, and he saw the place afar off. </p>
                <p><sup>4</sup>And he came to a well of water, and he said to his young men, 'Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad shall go (yonder), and when we have worshipped we shall come again to you.'  </p>
                <p><sup>5</sup>And he took the wood of the burnt-offering and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife, and they went both of them together to that place.  </p>
                <p><sup>6</sup>And Isaac said to his father, 'Father;' and he said, 'Here am I, my son.'  And he said unto him, 'Behold the fire, and the knife, and the wood; but where is the sheep for the burnt-offering, father?' </p>
                <p><sup>7</sup>And he said, 'God will provide for himself a sheep for a burnt-offering, my son.'  And he drew near to the place of the mount of God.  </p>
                <p><sup>8</sup>And he built an altar, and he placed the wood on the altar, and bound Isaac his son, and placed him on the wood which was upon the altar, and stretched forth his hand to take the knife to slay Isaac his son.  </p>
                <p><sup>9</sup>And I stood before him, and before the prince Mast&ecirc;m&acirc;, and the Lord said, 'Bid him not to lay his hand on the lad, nor to do anything to him, for I have shown that he fears the Lord.'  </p>
                <p><sup>10</sup>And I called to him from heaven, and said unto him:  'Abraham, Abraham;' and he was terrified and said:  'Behold, (here) am I.' </p>
                <p><sup>11</sup>And I said unto him: 'Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything to him; for now I have shown that thou fearest the Lord, and hast not withheld thy son, thy first-born son, from me.'  </p>
                <p><sup>12</sup>And the prince Mast&ecirc;m&acirc; was put to shame; and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold a ram caught . . . by his horns, and Abraham went and took the ram and offered it for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.  </p>
                <p><sup>13</sup>And Abraham called that place 'The Lord hath seen', so that it is said <em>in the mount</em> the Lord hath
                 seen: that is Mount Sion.</p>
                <p><sup>14</sup>And the Lord called Abraham by his name a second time from heaven, as he caused us to appear to speak to him in the name of the Lord.</p>
                <p><sup>15</sup>And he said: 'By Myself have I sworn, saith the Lord,<BR><BR>
                      Because thou hast done this thing, <BR>
                      And hast not withheld thy son, thy beloved son, from Me,<BR>
                      That in blessing I will bless thee,<BR><BR>
                      And in multiplying I will multiply thy seed <BR>
                      As the stars of heaven, And as the sand which is on the seashore.<BR><BR>               
                      And thy seed shall inherit the cities of its enemies,</p>
                <p><sup>16</sup>And in thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed;<BR><BR>                
                      Because thou hast obeyed My voice, <BR>
                      And I have shown to all that thou art faithful unto Me in all that I have said unto thee: <BR><BR>
                      Go in peace.'</p>
                <p><sup>17</sup>And Abraham went to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba, and Abraham [2010 A.M.] dwelt by the Well of the Oath.</p>
                <p><sup>18</sup>And he celebrated this festival every year, seven days with joy, and he called it the festival of the Lord according to the seven days during which he went and returned in peace.</p>
                <p><sup>19</sup>And accordingly has it been ordained and written on the heavenly tablets regarding Israel and its seed that they should observe this festival seven days with the joy of festival.</p>
                 


    <H2>Chapter 3</H2>

            <p class="chapterTitle"> Return of Abraham to Hebron. Death and burial of Sarah, 1-9. Marriage of Isaac and second marriage of Abraham. Birth of Esau and Jacob, 10-14. Abraham commends Jacob to Rebecca and blesses him, 15-31. (Cf. Gen. xxiii.1-4, 11-16; xxiv.15; xxv.1-2, 25-27; xiii. 16.)</p>
                            
            
                <p><sup>1</sup>And in the first year of the first week in the forty-second jubilee, Abraham returned and dwelt opposite Hebron, that is Kirjath Arba, two weeks of years.</p>
                <p><sup>2</sup>And in the first year of the third week of this jubilee the days of the life of Sarah were accomplished, and she died in Hebron.</p>
                <p><sup>3</sup>And Abraham went to mourn over her and bury her, and we tried him [to see] if his spirit were patient and he were not indignant in the words of his mouth; and he was found patient in this, and was not disturbed.</p>
                <p><sup>4</sup>For in patience of spirit he conversed with the children of Heth, to the intent that they should give him a place in which to bury his dead.</p>
                <p><sup>5</sup>And the Lord gave him grace before all who saw him, and he besought in gentleness the sons of Heth, and they gave him the land of the double cave over against Mamre, that is Hebron, for four hundred pieces of silver.</p>
                <p><sup>6</sup>And they besought him saying, We shall give it to thee for nothing; but he would not take it from their hands for nothing, for he gave the price of the place, the money in full, and he bowed down before them twice, and after this he buried his dead in the double cave.</p>
                <p><sup>7</sup>And all the days of the life of Sarah were one hundred and twenty-seven years, that is, two jubilees and four weeks and one year: these are the days of the years of the life of Sarah.</p>
                <p><sup>8</sup>This is the tenth trial wherewith Abraham was tried, and he was found faithful, patient in spirit.</p>
                <p><sup>9</sup>And he said not a single word regarding the rumour in the land how that God had said that He would give it to him and to his seed after him, and he begged a place there to bury his dead; for he was found faithful, and was recorded on the heavenly tablets as the friend of God.</p>
                <p><sup>10</sup>And in the fourth year thereof he took a wife for his son Isaac and her name was Rebecca [2020 A.M.] [the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, the brother of Abraham] the sister of Laban and daughter of Bethuel; and Bethuel was the son of Melca, who was the wife of Nahor, the brother of Abraham.</p>
                <p><sup>11</sup>And Abraham took to himself a third wife, and her name was Keturah, from among the daughters of his household servants, for Hagar had died before Sarah. And she bare him six sons, Zimram, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah, in the two weeks of years.</p>
                <p><sup>12</sup>And in the sixth week, in the second year thereof, Rebecca bare to Isaac two sons, Jacob and Esau,</p>
                <p><sup>13</sup>and [2046 A.M.] Jacob was a smooth and upright man, and Esau was fierce, a man of the field, and hairy, and Jacob dwelt in tents.</p>
                <p><sup>14</sup>And the youths grew, and Jacob learned to write; but Esau did not learn, for he was a man of the field and a hunter, and he learnt war, and all his deeds were fierce. </p>
                <p><sup>15</sup>And Abraham loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau.</p>
                <p><sup>16</sup>And Abraham saw the deeds of Esau, and he knew that in Jacob should his name and seed be called; and he called Rebecca and gave commandment regarding Jacob, for he knew that she (too) loved Jacob much more than Esau.</p>
                <p><sup>17</sup>And he said unto her:  <BR><BR>
                             My daughter, watch over my son Jacob, <BR>
                             For he shall be in my stead on the earth, <BR>
                             And for a blessing in the midst of the children of men, <BR>
                             And for the glory of the whole seed of Shem.</p>
                <p><sup>18</sup>For I know that the Lord will choose him to be a people for possession unto Himself, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.</p>
                <p><sup>19</sup>And behold, Isaac my son loves Esau more than Jacob, but I see that thou truly lovest Jacob.</p>
                <p><sup>20</sup>Add still further to thy kindness to him, <BR>
                             And let thine eyes be upon him in love; <BR>
                             For he shall be a blessing unto us on the earth from henceforth unto all generations of the earth.</p>
                <p><sup>21</sup>Let thy hands be strong <BR>
                             And let thy heart rejoice in thy son Jacob; <BR>
                             For I have loved him far beyond all my sons.<BR><BR>
                             He shall be blessed for ever, <BR>
                             And his seed shall fill the whole earth.</p>
                <p><sup>22</sup>If a man can number the sand of the earth, <BR>
                             His seed also shall be numbered.</p>
                <p><sup>23</sup>And all the blessings wherewith the Lord hath blessed me and my seed shall belong to Jacob and his seed alway.</p>
                <p><sup>24</sup>And in his seed shall my name be blessed, and the name of my fathers, Shem, and Noah, and Enoch, and Mahalalel, and Enos, and Seth, and Adam.</p>
                <p><sup>25</sup>And these shall serve <BR><BR>
                             To lay the foundations of the heaven, <BR>
                             And to strengthen the earth, <BR>
                             And to renew all the luminaries which are in the firmament.</p>
                <p><sup>26</sup>And he called Jacob before the eyes of Rebecca his mother, and kissed him, and blessed him, and said:</p>
                <p><sup>27</sup>'Jacob, my beloved son, whom my soul loveth, may God bless thee from above the firmament, and may He give thee all the blessings wherewith He blessed Adam, and Enoch, and Noah, and Shem; and all the things of which He told me, and all the things which He promised to give me, may he cause to cleave to thee and to thy seed for ever, according to the days of heaven above the earth.</p>
                <p><sup>28</sup>And the Spirits of Mast&ecirc;m&acirc; shall not rule over thee or over thy seed to turn thee from the Lord, who is thy God from henceforth for ever.</p>
                <p><sup>29</sup>And may the Lord God be a father to thee and thou the first-born son, and to the people alway.</p>
                <p><sup>30</sup>Go in peace, my son.'  And they both went forth together from Abraham.</p>
                <p><sup>31</sup>And Rebecca loved Jacob, with all her heart and with all her soul, very much more than Esau; but Isaac loved Esau much more than Jacob.</p>
