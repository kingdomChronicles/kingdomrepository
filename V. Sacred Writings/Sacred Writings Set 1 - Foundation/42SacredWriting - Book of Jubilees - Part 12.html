<p class="chapterTitle">How to compute Jubilee years</p>
<p>
1 Jubilee  = 7 weeks <br>
1 Week     = 7 years <br>
1 Jubilee  = 49 years
</p>
<p>Sample Computation:</p>
<p>There are 49 Jubilees, 2 weeks and 2 years from Adam to the 40 days of Moses on Mt. Sinai.</p>
<p>
49 jubilees x 49 years / jubilee =    2401 years <br>
7 weeks x 7 years / week ----- =    49 years <br>
2 years------------------------- =     2  years 
</p>

<p>2,401 years + 49 years + 2 years = 2410 years from Adam to Mt Sinai when the Law was given to Moses </p>

    <H2>Chapter 1</H2>

          <p class="chapterTitle"> Dinah ravished, 1-3. Slaughter of the Shechemites, 4-6. Laws against intermarriage between Israel and the heathen, 7-17. Levi chosen for the priesthood on account of his slaughter of the Shechemites, 18-23. Dinah recovered, 24. Jacob's reproof, 25-26. (Cf. Gen. xxxiii.18, xxxiv.2, 4, 7, 13-14, 25-30, xxxv.5.)</p>
                                                                                                                                         
                    
                <p><sup>1</sup>And in the first year of the sixth week [2143 A.M.] he went up to Salem, to the east of Shechem, in peace, in the fourth month.</p>
                <p><sup>2</sup>And there they carried off Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, into the house of Shechem, the son of Hamor, the Hivite, the prince of the land, and he lay with her and defiled her, and she was a little girl, a child of twelve years.</p>
                <p><sup>3</sup>And he besought his father and her brothers that she might be given to him to wife. And Jacob and his sons were wroth because of the men of Shechem; for they had defiled Dinah, their sister, and they spake to them with evil intent and dealt deceitfully with them and beguiled them.</p>
                <p><sup>4</sup>And Simeon and Levi came unexpectedly to Shechem and executed judgment on all the men of Shechem, and slew all the men whom they found in it, and left not a single one remaining in it:  they slew all in torments because they had dishonoured their sister Dinah.</p>
                <p><sup>5</sup>And thus let it not again be done from henceforth that a daughter of Israel be defiled; for judgment is ordained in heaven against them that they should destroy with
                the sword all the men of the Shechemites because they had wrought shame in Israel.</p>
                <p><sup>6</sup>And the Lord delivered them into the hands of the sons of Jacob that they might exterminate them with the sword and execute judgment upon them, and that it might not thus again be done in Israel that a virgin of Israel should be defiled.</p>
                <p><sup>7</sup>And if there is any man who wishes in Israel to give his daughter or his sister to any man who is of the seed of the Gentiles he shall surely die, and they shall stone him with stones; for he hath wrought shame in Israel; and they shall burn the woman
                with fire, because she has dishonoured the name of the house of her father, and she shall be rooted out of Israel.</p>
                <p><sup>8</sup>And let not an adulteress and no uncleanness be found in Israel throughout all the days of the generations of the earth; for Israel is holy unto the Lord, and every man who has defiled (it) shall surely die: they shall stone him with stones.</p>
                <p><sup>9</sup>For thus has it been ordained and written in the heavenly tablets regarding all the seed of Israel:  he who defileth (it) shall surely die, and he shall be stoned with stones.</p>
                <p><sup>10</sup>And to this law there is no limit of days, and no remission, nor any atonement: but the man who has defiled his daughter shall be rooted out in the midst of all Israel, because he has given of his seed to Moloch, and wrought impiously so as to defile it.</p>
                <p><sup>11</sup>And do thou, Moses, command the children of Israel and exhort them not to give their daughters to the Gentiles, and not to take for their sons any of the daughters of the Gentiles, for this is abominable before the Lord.</p>
                <p><sup>12</sup>For this reason I have written for thee in the words of the Law all the deeds of the Shechemites, which they wrought against Dinah, and how the sons of Jacob spake, saying:  'We will not give our daughter to a man who is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us.'</p>
                <p><sup>13</sup>And it is a reproach to Israel, to those who live, and to those that take the daughters of the Gentiles; for this is unclean and abominable to Israel.</p>
                <p><sup>14</sup>And Israel will not be free from this uncleanness if it has a wife of the daughters of the Gentiles, or has given any of its daughters to a man who is of any of the
                Gentiles.</p>
                <p><sup>14</sup>For there will be plague upon plague, and curse upon curse, and every judgment and plague and curse will come <em>upon him</em>:  if he do this thing, or hide his eyes from those who commit uncleanness, or those who defile the sanctuary of the Lord, or those who profane His holy name, (then) will the whole nation together be judged for all the uncleanness and profanation of this man.</p>
                <p><sup>15</sup>And there will be no respect of persons [and no consideration of persons] and no receiving at his hands of fruits and offerings and burnt-offerings and fat, nor the fragrance of sweet savour, so as to accept it: and so fare every man or woman in Israel who defiles the sanctuary.</p>
                <p><sup>16</sup>For this reason I have commanded thee, saying:  'Testify this testimony to Israel:  see how the Shechemites fared and their sons:  how they were delivered into the hands of two sons of Jacob, and they slew them under tortures, and it was (reckoned) unto them for righteousness, and it is written down to them for righteousness.</p>
                <p><sup>17</sup>And the seed of Levi was chosen for the priesthood, and to be Levites, that they might minister before the Lord, as we, continually, and that Levi and his sons may be blessed for ever; for he was zealous to execute righteousness and judgment and vengeance on all those who arose against Israel.</p>
                <p><sup>18</sup>And so they inscribe as a testimony in his favour on the heavenly tablets blessing and righteousness before the God of all:</p>
                <p><sup>19</sup>And we remember the righteousness which the man fulfilled during his life, at all periods of the year; until a thousand generations they will record it, and it will come to him and to his descendants after him, and he has been recorded on the heavenly tablets as a friend and a righteous man.</p>
                <p><sup>20</sup>All this account I have written for thee, and have commanded thee to say to the children of Israel, that they should not commit sin nor transgress the ordinances nor break the covenant which has been ordained for them, (but) that they should fulfil it and be recorded as friends.</p>
                <p><sup>21</sup>But if they transgress and work uncleanness in every way, they will be recorded on the heavenly tablets as adversaries, and they will be destroyed out of the book of life, and they will be recorded in the book of those who will be destroyed and with those who will be rooted out of the earth.</p>
                <p><sup>22</sup>And on the day when the sons of Jacob slew Shechem a writing was recorded in their favour in heaven that they had executed righteousness and uprightness and vengeance on the sinners, and it was written for a blessing.</p>
                <p><sup>23</sup>And they brought Dinah, their sister, out of the house of Shechem, and they took captive everything that was in Shechem, their sheep and their oxen and their asses, and all their wealth, and all their flocks, and brought them all to Jacob their father.</p>
                <p><sup>24</sup>And he reproached them because they had put the city to the sword for he feared those who dwelt in the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</p>
                <p><sup>25</sup>And the dread of the Lord was upon all the cities which are around about Shechem, and they did not rise to pursue after the sons of Jacob; for terror had fallen upon them.</p>
                


    <H2>Chapter 2</H2>

          <p class="chapterTitle"> Jacob goes to Bethel to offer sacrifice, 1-3 (cf. Gen. xxxv.2-4, 7, 14). Isaac blesses Levi, 4-17, and Judah, 18-22. Jacob recounts to Isaac how God prospered him, 24. Jacob goes to Bethel with Rebecca and Deborah, 26-30. Jacob blesses the God of his fathers, 31-32.</p>
                                                                                                                                              
               
                
                <p><sup>1</sup>And on the new moon of the month Jacob spake to all the people of his house.  saying: 'Purify yourselves and change your garments, and let us arise and go up to Bethel, where I vowed a vow to Him on the day when I fled from the face of Esau my brother, because he has been with me and brought me into this land in peace, and put ye away the strange gods that arc among you.'  
                <p><sup>2</sup>And they gave up the strange gods and that which was in their ears and which was on their necks and the idols which Rachel stole from Laban her father she gave wholly to Jacob.  And he burnt and brake them to pieces and destroyed them, and hid them under an oak which is in the land of Shechem.  
                <p><sup>3</sup>And he went up on the new moon of the seventh month to Bethel. And he built an altar at the place where he had slept, and he set up a pillar there, and he sent word to his father Isaac to come to him to his sacrifice, and to his mother Rebecca.  
                <p><sup>4</sup>And Isaac said: 'Let my son Jacob come, and let me see him before I die.'  
                <p><sup>5</sup>And Jacob went to his father Isaac and to his mother Rebecca, to the house of his father Abraham, and he took two of his sons with him, Levi and Judah, and he came to his father Isaac and to his mother Rebecca.
                <p><sup>6</sup>And Rebecca came forth from the tower to the front of it to kiss Jacob and embrace him; for her spirit had revived when she heard:  'Behold Jacob thy son has come'; and she kissed him.  
                <p><sup>7</sup>And she saw his two sons, and she recognised them, and said unto him:  'Are these thy sons, my son?' and she embraced them and kissed them, and blessed them, saying: 'In you shall the seed of Abraham become illustrious, and ye shall prove a blessing on the earth.'  
                <p><sup>8</sup>And Jacob went in to Isaac his father, to the chamber where he lay, and his two sons were with him, and he took the hand of his father, and stooping down he kissed him, and Isaac clung to the neck of Jacob his son, and wept upon his neck.  
                <p><sup>9</sup>And the darkness left the eyes of Isaac, and he saw the two sons of Jacob, Levi, and Judah, and he said:  'Are these thy sons, my son?  for they are like thee.'  
                <p><sup>10</sup>And he said unto him that they were truly his sons:  'And thou hast truly seen that they are truly my sons'.
                <p><sup>11</sup>And they came near to him, and he turned and kissed them and embraced them both together.
                <p><sup>12</sup>And the spirit of prophecy came down into his mouth, and he took Levi by his right hand and Judah by his left.  
                <p><sup>13</sup>And he turned to Levi first, and began to bless him first, and said unto him: May the God of all, the very Lord of all the ages, bless thee and thy children throughout all the ages.  
                <p><sup>14</sup>And may the Lord give to thee and to thy seed greatness and great glory, and cause thee and thy seed, from among all flesh, to approach Him to serve in His sanctuary as the angels of the presence and as the holy ones.  (Even) as they, shall the seed of thy sons be for glory and greatness and holiness, and may He make them great unto all the ages.  
                <p><sup>15</sup>And they shall be judges and princes, and chiefs of all the seed of the sons of Jacob;<P>
                 They shall speak the word of the Lord in righteousness, <BR>
                 And they shall judge all His judgments in righteousness.<P>
                 And they shall declare My ways to Jacob <BR>
                 And My paths to Israel.<P>
                 The blessing of the Lord shall be given in their mouths <BR>
                 To bless all the seed of the beloved.<P>
                <p><sup>16</sup>Thy mother has called thy name Levi, <BR>
                 And justly has she called thy name;<P>
                 Thou shalt be joined to the Lord <BR>
                 And be the companion of all the sons of Jacob;<P>
                 Let His table be thine, <BR>
                 And do thou and thy sons eat thereof;<P>
                 And may thy table be full unto all generations, <BR>
                 And thy food fail not unto all the ages.<P>
                <p><sup>17</sup>And let all who hate thee fall down before thee, <BR>
                 And let all thy adversaries be rooted out and perish;<P>
                 And blessed be he that blesses thee,<BR>
                 And cursed be every nation that curses thee.' <P>
                <p><sup>18</sup>And to Judah he said:  <BR>
                 'May the Lord give thee strength and power<P>
                 To tread down all that hate thee;<BR>
                 A prince shalt thou be, thou and one of thy sons, over the sons of Jacob;<P>
                 May thy name and the name of thy sons go forth and traverse every land and region.  <BR>
                 Then shall the Gentiles fear before thy face,<P>
                 And all the nations shall quake <BR>
                 [And all the peoples shall quake].<P>
                <p><sup>19</sup>In thee shall be the help of Jacob,<BR>
                 And in thee be found the salvation of Israel.<P>
                <p><sup>20</sup>And when thou sittest on the throne of honour of thy righteousness<BR>
                 There shall be great peace for all the seed of the sons of the beloved;<P>
                 Blessed be he that blesseth thee, <BR>
                 And all that hate thee and afflict thee and curse thee<BR>
                 Shall be rooted out and destroyed from the earth and be accursed.'<P>
                <p><sup>21</sup>And turning he kissed him again and embraced him, and rejoiced greatly; for he had seen the sons of Jacob his son in very truth.  
                <p><sup>22</sup>And he went forth from between his feet and fell down and bowed down to him, and he blessed them and rested there with Isaac his father that night, and they eat and drank with joy.  
                <p><sup></sup>And he made the two sons of Jacob sleep, the one on his right hand and the other on his left, and it was counted to him for righteousness.  
                <p><sup>23</sup>And Jacob told his father everything during the night, how the Lord had shown him great mercy, and how he had prospered (him in) all his ways, and protected him from all evil.  
                <p><sup>24</sup>And Isaac blessed the God of his father Abraham, who had not withdrawn his mercy and his righteousness from the sons of his servant Isaac. 
                <p><sup>25</sup>And in the morning Jacob told his father Isaac the vow which he had vowed to the Lord, and the vision which he had seen, and that he had built an altar, and that everything was ready for the sacrifice to be made before the Lord as he had vowed, and that he had come to set him on an ass. 
                <p><sup>26</sup>And Isaac said unto Jacob his son:  'I am not able to go with thee; for I am old and not able to bear the way:  go, my son, in peace; for I am one hundred and sixty-five years this day; I am no longer able to journey; set thy mother (on an ass) and let her go with thee.  
                <p><sup>27</sup>And I know, my son, that thou hast come on my account, and may this day be blessed on which thou hast seen me alive, and I also have seen thee, my son.  
                <p><sup>28</sup>Mayest thou prosper and fulfil the vow which thou hast vowed; and put not off thy vow; for thou shalt be called to account as touching the vow; now therefore make haste to perform it, and may He be pleased who has made all things, to whom thou hast vowed the vow.'
                <p><sup>29</sup>And he said to Rebecca:  'Go with Jacob thy son'; and Rebecca went with Jacob her son, and Deborah with her, and they came to Bethel.  
                <p><sup>30</sup>And Jacob remembered the prayer with which his father had blessed him and his two sons, Levi and Judah, and he rejoiced and blessed the God of his fathers, Abraham and Isaac.  
                <p><sup>31</sup>And he said:  'Now I know that I have an eternal hope, and my sons also, before the God of all'; and thus is it ordained concerning the two; and they record it as an eternal testimony unto them on the heavenly tablets how Isaac blessed them.
