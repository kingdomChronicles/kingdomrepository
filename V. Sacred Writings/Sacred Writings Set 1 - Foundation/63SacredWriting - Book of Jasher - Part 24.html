        <H2>Chapter 1</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> The Ten Commandments are Given. While Moses is in the Mount, Aaron makes a Golden Calf, and Israel Worships it. Civil War. The Lord has a Sanctuary Built for His Worship in the Wilderness.</p>                 


                    
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And the children of Israel proceeded from Rephidim and they encamped in the wilderness of Sinai, in the third month from their going forth from Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> At that time came Reuel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses, with Zipporah his daughter and her two sons, for he had heard of the wonders of the Lord which he had done to Israel, that he had delivered them from the hand of Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And Reuel came to Moses to the wilderness where he was encamped, where was the mountain of God.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And Moses went forth to meet his father-in-law with great honor, and all Israel was with him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And Reuel and his children remained amongst the Israelites for many days, and Reuel knew the Lord from that day forward.</p>
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And in the third month from the children of Israel's departure from Egypt, on the sixth day thereof, the Lord gave to Israel the ten commandments on Mount Sinai.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And all Israel heard all these commandments, and all Israel rejoiced exceedingly in the Lord on that day.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And the glory of the Lord rested upon Mount Sinai, and he called to Moses, and Moses came in the midst of a cloud and ascended  the mountain.</p>               
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And Moses was upon the mount forty days and forty nights; he ate no bread and drank no water, and the Lord instructed him in the statutes and judgments in order to teach the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And the Lord wrote the ten commandments which he had commanded the children of Israel upon two tablets of stone, which he gave to Moses to command the children of Israel.</p>                   
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And at the end of forty days and forty nights, when the Lord had finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, then the Lord gave to Moses the tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And when the children of Israel saw that Moses tarried to come down from the mount, they gathered round Aaron, and said, As for this man Moses we know not what has become of him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>13</sup> Now therefore rise up, make unto us a god who shall go before us, so that thou shalt not die.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And Aaron was greatly afraid of the people, and he ordered them to bring him gold and he made it into a molten calf for the people.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And the Lord said to Moses, before he had come down from the mount, Get thee down, for thy people whom thou didst bring forth from Egypt have corrupted themselves.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> They have made to themselves a molten calf, and have bowed down to it, now therefore leave me, that I may consume them from off the earth, for they are a stiffnecked people.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And Moses besought the countenance of the Lord, and he prayed to the Lord for the people on account of the calf which they had made, and he afterward descended from the mount and in his hands were the two tablets of stone, which God had given him to command the Israelites.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And when Moses approached the camp and saw the calf which the people had made, the anger of Moses was kindled and he broke the tablets under the mount.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And Moses came to the camp and he took the calf and burned it with fire, and ground it till it became fine dust, and strewed it upon the water and gave it to the Israelites to drink.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And there died of the people by the swords of each other about three thousand men who had made the calf.</p> 
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And on the morrow Moses said to the people, I will go up to the Lord, peradventure I may make atonement for your sins which you have sinned to the Lord.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And Moses again went up to the Lord, and he remained with the Lord forty days and forty nights.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And during the forty days did Moses entreat the Lord in behalf of the children of Israel, and the Lord hearkened to the prayer of Moses, and the Lord was entreated of him in behalf of Israel.</p>              
                      <p><sup>24</sup> Then spake the Lord to Moses to hew two stone tablets and to bring them up to the Lord, who would write upon them the ten commandments.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>25</sup> Now Moses did so, and he came down and hewed the two tablets and went up to Mount Sinai to the Lord, and the Lord wrote the ten commandments upon the tablets.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And Moses remained yet with the Lord forty days and forty nights, and the Lord instructed him in statutes and judgments to impart to Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And the Lord commanded him respecting the children of Israel that they should make a sanctuary for the Lord, that his name might rest therein, and the Lord showed him the likeness of the sanctuary and the likeness of all its vessels.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And at the end of the forty days, Moses came down from the mount and the two tablets were in his hand.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>29</sup> And Moses came to the children of Israel and spoke to them all the words of the Lord, and he taught them laws, statutes and judgments which the Lord had taught him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And Moses told the children of Israel the word of the Lord, that a sanctuary should be made for him, to dwell amongst the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And the people rejoiced greatly at all the good which the Lord had spoken to them, through Moses, and they said, We will do all that the Lord has spoken to thee.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And the people rose up like one man and they made generous offerings to the sanctuary of the Lord, and each man brought the  offering of the Lord for the work of the sanctuary, and for all its service.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>33</sup> And all the children of Israel brought each man of all that was found in his possession for the work of the sanctuary of the Lord, gold, silver and brass, and every thing that was serviceable for the sanctuary.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>34</sup> And all the wise men who were practiced in work came and made the sanctuary of the Lord, according to all that the Lord had commanded, every man in the work in which he had been practiced; and all the wise men in heart made the sanctuary, and its furniture and all the
                      vessels for the holy service, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And the work of the sanctuary of the tabernacle was completed at the end of five months, and the children of Israel did all that the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And they brought the sanctuary and all its furniture to Moses; like unto the representation which the Lord had shown to Moses, so did the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>37</sup> And Moses saw the work, and behold they did it as the Lord had commanded him, so Moses blessed them.</p>
                 

                    
        <H2>Chapter 2</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Aaron and his Sons are Placed in charge of the Lord's Service. The Sacrifices and Offerings. The Passover is Celebrated. The People lust for Flesh to eat. Their punishment. Moses sends Twelve Men to explore the Land of Canaan. Ten of them bring an Evil Report, and the People want to Return to Egypt. For their Lack of Faith that Generation shall not Live to obtain their Possessions.</p>   



                      <p><sup>1</sup> And in the twelfth month, in the twenty-third day of the month, Moses took Aaron and his sons, and he dressed them in their garments, and anointed them and did unto them as the Lord had commanded him, and Moses brought up all the offerings which the Lord had on that
                      day commanded him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> Moses afterward took Aaron and his sons and said to them, For seven days shall you remain at the door of the tabernacle, for thus am I commanded.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And Aaron and his sons did all that the Lord had commanded them through Moses, and they remained for seven days at the door of the tabernacle.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And on the eighth day, being the first day of the first month, in the second year from the Israelites' departure from Egypt, Moses erected the sanctuary, and Moses put up all the furniture of the tabernacle and all the furniture of the sanctuary, and he did all that the Lord had commanded him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And Moses called to Aaron and his sons, and they brought the burnt offering and the sin offering for themselves and the children of Israel, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>6</sup> On that day the two sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, took strange fire and brought it before the Lord who had not commanded them, and a fire went forth from before the Lord, and consumed them, and they died before the Lord on that day.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> Then on the day when Moses had completed to erect the sanctuary, the princes of the children of Israel began to bring their offerings before the Lord for the dedication of the altar.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And they brought up their offerings each prince for one day, a prince each day for twelve days.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And all the offerings which they brought, each man in his day, one silver charger weighing one hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour, mingled with oil for a meat offering.</p>
                      <p><sup>10</sup> One spoon, weighing ten shekels of gold, full of incense.</p>                   
                      <p><sup>11</sup> One young bullock, one ram, one lamb of the first year for a burnt offering.</p>                
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And one kid of the goats for a sin offering.</p>                    
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And for a sacrifice of peace offering, two oxen, five rams, five he-goats, five lambs of a year old.</p>
                      <p><sup>14</sup> Thus did the twelve princes of Israel day by day, each man in his day.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And it was after this, in the thirteenth day of the month, that Moses commanded the children of Israel to observe the Passover.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And the children of Israel kept the Passover in its season in the fourteenth day of the month, as the Lord had commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And in the second month, on the first day thereof, the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,</p>                     
                      <p><sup>18</sup> Number the heads of all the males of the children of Israel from twenty years old and upward, thou and thy brother Aaron and the twelve princes of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And Moses did so, and Aaron came with the twelve princes of Israel, and they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And the numbers of the children of Israel by the houses of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, were six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>21</sup> But the children of Levi were not numbered amongst their brethren the children of Israel.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And the number of all the males of the children of Israel from one month old and upward, was twenty-two thousand, two hundred and seventy-three.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And the number of the children of Levi from one month old and above, was twenty-two thousand.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And Moses placed the priests and the Levites each man to his service and to his burden to serve the sanctuary of the tabernacle, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken away from the tabernacle of testimony.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>26</sup> At that time the children of Israel continued their journey from the wilderness of Sinai, and they took a journey of three days, and the cloud rested upon the wilderness of Paran; there the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, for they had provoked the Lord in asking him for meat, that they might eat.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And the Lord hearkened to their voice, and gave them meat which they ate for one month.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>28</sup> But after this the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and he smote them with a great slaughter, and they were buried there in that place.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>29</sup> And the children of Israel called that place Kebroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted flesh.</p>
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And they departed from Kebroth Hattaavah and pitched in Hazeroth, which is in the wilderness of Paran.</p>
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And whilst the children of Israel were in Hazeroth, the anger of the Lord was kindled against Miriam on account of Moses, and she became leprous, white as snow.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And she was confined without the camp for seven days, until she had been received again after her leprosy.</p>
                      <p><sup>33</sup> The children of Israel afterward departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the end of the wilderness of Paran.</p>
                      <p><sup>34</sup> At that time, the Lord spoke to Moses to send twelve men from the children of Israel, one man to a tribe, to go and explore the land of Canaan.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And Moses sent the twelve men, and they came to the land of Canaan to search and examine it, and they explored the whole land from the wilderness of Sin to Rechob as thou comest to Chamoth.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And at the end of forty days they came to Moses and Aaron, and they brought him word as it was in their hearts, and ten of the men brought up an evil report to the children of Israel, of the land which they had explored, saying, It is better for us to return to Egypt than to go to this land, a land that consumes its inhabitants.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>37</sup> But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephuneh, who were of those that explored the land, said, The land is  exceedingly good.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>38</sup> If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us to this land and give it to us, for it is a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>39</sup> But the children of Israel would not hearken to them, and they hearkened to the words of the ten men who had brought up an evil report of the land.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>40</sup> And the Lord heard the murmurings of the children of Israel and he was angry and swore, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>41</sup> Surely not one man of this wicked generation shall see the land from twenty years old and upward excepting Caleb the son of Jephuneh and Joshua the son of Nun.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>42</sup> But surely this wicked generation shall perish in this wilderness, and their children shall come to the land and they shall possess it; so the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness for forty years until the end of that wicked generation, because they did not follow the Lord.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>43</sup> And the people dwelt in the wilderness of Paran a long time, and they afterward proceeded to the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.</p>
     


        <H2>Chapter 3</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Earth Swallows up the Rebellious. The Children of Israel commanded not to War with the Children of Esau, or Moab. The Edomites will not let Israel pass through their Land.</p>

                      
                                    
                      <p><sup>1</sup> At that time Korah the son of Jetzer the son of Kehath the son of Levi, took many men of the children of Israel, and they rose up and quarreled with Moses and Aaron and the whole congregation.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And the Lord was angry with them, and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, with their houses and all belonging to them, and all the men belonging to Korah.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And after this God made the people go round by the way of Mount Seir for a long time.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> At that time the Lord said unto Moses, Provoke not a war against the children of Esau, for  I will not give to you of any thing belonging to them, as much as the sole of the foot could tread upon, for I have given Mount Seir for an inheritance to Esau.</p> 
                      <p><sup>5</sup> Therefore did the children of Esau fight against the children of Seir in former times, and the Lord had delivered the children of Seir into the hands of the children of Esau, and destroyed them from before them, and the children of Esau dwelt in their stead unto this day.</p>
                      <p><sup>6</sup> Therefore the Lord said to the children of Israel, Fight not against the children of Esau your brethren, for nothing in their land belongs to you, but you may buy food of them for money and eat it, and you may buy water of them for money and drink it.</p> 
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And the children of Israel did according to the word of the Lord.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And the children of Israel went about the wilderness, going round by the way of Mount Sinai for a long time, and touched not the children of Esau, and they continued in that district for nineteen years.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> At that time died Latinus king of the children of Chittim, in the forty-fifth year of his reign, which is the fourteenth year of the children of Israel's departure from Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And they buried him in his place which he had built for himself in the land of Chittim, and Abimnas reigned in his place for thirty-eight years.</p>  
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And the children of Israel passed the boundary of the children of Esau in those days, at the end of nineteen years, and they came and passed the road of the wilderness of Moab.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And the Lord said to Moses, besiege not Moab, and do not fight against them, for I will give you nothing of their land.</p>
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And the children of Israel passed the road of the wilderness of Moab for nineteen years, and they did not fight against them.</p>
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And in the thirty-sixth year of the children of Israel's departing from Egypt the Lord smote the heart of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and he waged war, and went forth to fight against the children of Moab.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And Sihon sent messengers to Beor the son of Janeas, the son of Balaam, counsellor to the king of Egypt, and to Balaam his son, to curse Moab, in order that it might be delivered into the hand of Sihon.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And the messengers went and brought Beor the son of Janeas, and Balaam his son, from Pethor in Mesopotamia, so Beor and Balaam his son came to the city of Sihon and they cursed Moab and their king in the presence of Sihon king of the Amorites.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>17</sup> So Sihon went out with his whole army, and he went to Moab and fought against them, and he subdued them, and the Lord delivered them into his hands, and Sihon slew the king of Moab.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And Sihon took all the cities of Moab in the battle; he also took Heshbon from them, for Heshbon was one of the cities of Moab, and Sihon placed his princes and his nobles in Heshbon, and Heshbon belonged to Sihon in those days.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>19</sup> Therefore the parable speakers Beor and Balaam his son uttered these words, saying, Come unto Heshbon, the city of Sihon will be built and established.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>20</sup> Woe unto thee Moab! thou art lost, O people of Kemosh! behold it is written upon the book of the law of God.</p> 
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And when Sihon had conquered Moab, he placed guards in the cities which he had taken from Moab, and a considerable number of the children of Moab fell in battle into the hand of Sihon, and he made a great capture of them, sons and daughters, and he slew their king; so Sihon turned back to his own land.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And Sihon gave numerous presents of silver and gold to Beor and Balaam his son, and he dismissed them, and they went to Mesopotamia to their home and country.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>23</sup> At that time all the children of Israel passed from the road of the wilderness of Moab, and returned and surrounded the wilderness of Edom.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>24</sup> So the whole congregation came to the wilderness of Sin in the first month of the fortieth year from their departure from Egypt, and the children of Israel dwelt there in Kadesh, of the wilderness of Sin, and Miriam died there and she was buried there.</p> 
                      <p><sup>25</sup> At that time Moses sent messengers to Hadad king of Edom, saying, Thus says thy brother Israel, Let me pass I pray thee through thy land, we will not pass through field or vineyard, we will not drink the water of the well; we will walk in the king's road.</p>
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass through my country, and Edom went forth to meet the children of Israel with a mighty people.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And the children of Esau refused to let the children of Israel pass through their land, so the Israelites removed from them and fought not against them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>28</sup> For before this the Lord had commanded the children of Israel, saying, You shall not fight against the children of Esau, therefore the Israelites removed from them and did not fight against them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>29</sup> So the children of Israel departed from Kadesh, and all the people came to Mount Hor.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>30</sup> At that time the Lord said to Moses, Tell thy brother Aaron that he shall die there, for he shall not come to the land which I have given to the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And Aaron went up, at the command of the Lord, to Mount Hor, in the fortieth year, in the fifth month, in the first day of the month.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old when he died in Mount Hor.</p>        


        <H2>Chapter 4</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Some of the Canaanites rise up to fight Israel, who are frightened and run away. But the Sons of Levi compel them to Return. They prevail over their Enemies. They must not touch Ammon. Og, King of Bashan. Balaam is called upon to curse Israel, but will not. Israel commits Whoredom with the Moabites, and they are Smitten with Pestilence.</p>

                    

                      <p><sup>1</sup> And king Arad the Canaanite, who dwelt in the south, heard that the Israelites had come by the way of the spies, and he arranged his forces to fight against the Israelites.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And the children of Israel were greatly afraid of him, for he had a great and heavy army, so the children of Israel resolved to return to Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And the children of Israel turned back about the distance of three days' journey unto Maserath Beni Jaakon, for they were greatly afraid on account of the king Arad.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And the children of Israel would not get back to their places, so they remained in Beni Jaakon for thirty days.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And when the children of Levi saw that the children of Israel would not turn back, they were jealous for the sake of the Lord, and they rose up and fought against the Israelites their brethren, and slew of them a great body, and forced them to turn back to their place, Mount Hor.</p>                    
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And when they returned, king Arad was still arranging his host for battle against the Israelites.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And Israel vowed a vow, saying, If thou wilt deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and he delivered the Canaanites into their hand, and he utterly destroyed them and their cities, and he called the name of the place Hormah.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And the children of Israel journeyed from Mount Hor and pitched in Oboth, and they journeyed from Oboth and they pitched at Ije-abarim, in the border of Moab.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And the children of Israel sent to Moab, saying, Let us pass now through thy land into our place, but the children of Moab would not suffer the children of Israel to pass through their land, for the children of Moab were greatly afraid lest the children of Israel should do unto them as Sihon king of the Amorites had done to them, who had taken their land and had slain many of them.</p>
                      <p><sup>11</sup> Therefore Moab would not suffer the Israelites to pass through his land, and the Lord commanded the children of Israel, saying, That they should not fight against Moab, so the Israelites removed from Moab.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And the children of Israel journeyed from the border of Moab, and they came to the other side of Arnon, the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites, and they pitched in the border of Sihon, king of the Amorites, in the wilderness of Kedemoth.</p> 
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And the children of Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>14</sup> Let us pass through thy land, we will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards, we will go along by the king's highway until we shall have passed thy border, but Sihon would not suffer the Israelites to pass.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>15</sup> So Sihon collected all the people of the Amorites and went forth into the wilderness to meet the children of Israel, and he fought against Israel in Jahaz.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And the Lord delivered Sihon king of the Amorites into the hand of the children of Israel, and Israel smote all the people of Sihon with the edge of the sword and avenged the cause of Moab.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And the children of Israel took possession of the land of Sihon from Aram unto Jabuk, unto the children of Ammon, and they took all the spoil of the cities.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And all the children of Israel resolved to fight against the children of Ammon, to take their land also.</p>
                      <p><sup>20</sup> So the Lord said to the children of Israel, Do not besiege the children of Ammon, neither stir up battle against them, for I will give nothing to you of their land, and the children of Israel hearkened to the word of the Lord, and did not fight against the children of Ammon.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And the children of Israel turned and went up by the way of Bashan to the land of Og, king of Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan went out to meet the Israelites in battle, and he had with him many valiant men, and a very strong force from the people of the Amorites.</p>
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And Og king of Bashan was a very powerful man, but Naaron his son was exceedingly powerful, even stronger than he was.</p>
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And Og said in his heart, Behold now the whole camp of Israel takes up a space of three parsa, now will I smite them at once without sword or spear.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And Og went up Mount Jahaz, and took therefrom one large stone, the length of which was three parsa, and he placed it on his head, and resolved to throw it upon the camp of the children of Israel, to smite all the Israelites with that stone.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And the angel of the Lord came and pierced the stone upon the head of Og, and the stone fell upon the neck of Og that Og fell to the earth on account of the weight of the stone upon his neck.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>26</sup> At that time the Lord said to the children of Israel, Be not afraid of him, for I have given him and all his people and all his land into your hand, and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And Moses went down to him with a small number of the children of Israel, and Moses smote Og with a stick at the ankles of his feet and slew him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>28</sup> The children of Israel afterward pursued the children of Og and all his people, and they beat and destroyed them till there was no remnant left of them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>29</sup> Moses afterward sent some of the children of Israel to spy out Jaazer, for Jaazer was a very famous city.</p> 
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And the spies went to Jaazer and explored it, and the spies trusted in the Lord, and they fought against the men of Jaazer.</p>
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And these men took Jaazer and its villages, and the Lord delivered them into their hand, and they drove out the Amorites who had been there.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And the children of Israel took the land of the two kings of the Amorites, sixty cities which were on the other side of Jordan, from the brook of Arnon unto Mount Herman.</p>       
                      <p><sup>33</sup> And the children of Israel journeyed and came into the plain of Moab which is on this side of Jordan, by Jericho.</p>
                      <p><sup>34</sup> And the children of Moab heard all the evil which the children of Israel had done to the two kings of the Amorites, to Sihon and Og, so all the men of Moab were greatly afraid of the Israelites.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And the elders of Moab said, Behold the two kings of the Amorites, Sihon and Og, who swere more powerful than all the kings of the earth, could not stand against the children of Israel, how then can we stand before them?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>36</sup> Surely they sent us a message before now to pass through our land on their way, and we would not suffer them, now they will turn upon us with their heavy swords and destroy us; and Moab was distressed on account of the children of Israel, and they were greatly afraid of
                      them, and they counselled together what was to be done to the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>37</sup> And the elders of Moab resolved and took one of their men, Balak the son of Zippor the Moabite, and made him king over them at that time, and Balak was a very wise man.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And the elders of Moab rose up and sent to the children of Midian to make peace with them, for a great battle and enmity had been in those days between Moab and Midian, from the days of Hadad the son of Bedad king of Edom, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, unto these days.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>39</sup> And the children of Moab sent to the children of Midian, and they made peace with them, and the elders of Midian came to the land of Moab to make peace in behalf of the children of Midian.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>40</sup> And the elders of Moab counselled with the elders of Midian what to do in order to save their lives from Israel.</p>
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And all the children of Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now therefore the children of Israel lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field, for thus did they do to the two kings of the Amorites who are stronger than we are.</p>
                      <p><sup>42</sup> And the elders of Midian said to Moab, We have heard that at the time when Sihon king of the Amorites fought against you, when he prevailed over you and took your land, he had sent to Beor the son of Janeas and to Balaam his son from Mesopotamia, and they came and cursed you; therefore did the hand of Sihon prevail over you, that he took your land.</p>                        
                      <p><sup>43</sup> Now therefore send you also to Balaam his son, for he still remains in his land, and give him his hire, that he may come and curse all the people of whom you are afraid; so the elders of Moab heard this thing, and it pleased them to send to Balaam the son of Beor.</p>
                      <p><sup>44</sup> So Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab sent messengers to Balaam, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>45</sup> Behold there is a people come out from Egypt, behold they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me.</p>
                      <p><sup>46</sup> Now therefore come and curse this people for me, for they are too mighty for me, peradventure I shall prevail to fight against them, and drive them out, for I heard that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and whom thou cursest is cursed.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>47</sup> So the messengers of Balak went to Balaam and brought Balaam to curse the people to fight against Moab.</p> 
                      <p><sup>48</sup> And Balaam came to Balak to curse Israel, and the Lord said to Balaam, Curse not this people for it is blessed.</p>
                      <p><sup>49</sup> And Balak urged Balaam day by day to curse Israel, but Balaam hearkened not to Balak on account of the word of the Lord which he had spoken to Balaam.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>50</sup> And when Balak saw that Balaam would not accede to his wish, he rose up and went home, and Balaam also returned to his land and he went from there to Midian.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>51</sup> And the children of Israel journeyed from the plain of Moab, and pitched by Jordan from Beth-jesimoth even unto Abel-shittim, at the end of the plains of Moab.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>52</sup> And when the children of Israel abode in the plain of Shittim, they began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.</p>
                      <p><sup>53</sup> And the children of Israel approached Moab, and the children of Moab pitched their tents opposite to the camp of the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>54</sup> And the children of Moab were afraid of the children of Israel, and the children of Moab took all their daughters and their wives of beautiful aspect and comely appearance, and dressed them in gold and silver and costly garments.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>55</sup> And the children of Moab seated those women at the door of their tents, in order that the children of Israel might see them and turn to them, and not fight against Moab.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>56</sup> And all the children of Moab did this thing to the children of Israel, and every man placed his wife and daughter at the door of his tent, and all the children of Israel saw the act of the children of Moab, and the children of Israel turned to the daughters of Moab and  coveted them, and they went to them.</p>
                      <p><sup>57</sup> And it came to pass that when a Hebrew came to the door of the tent of Moab, and saw a daughter of Moab and desired her in his heart, and spoke with her at the door of the tent that which he desired, whilst they were speaking together the men of the tent would come out and
                      speak to the Hebrew like unto these words:</p>                       
                      <p><sup>58</sup> Surely you know that we are brethren, we are all the descendants of Lot and the descendants of Abraham his brother, wherefore then will you not remain with us, and wherefore will you not eat our bread and our sacrifice?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>59</sup> And when the children of Moab had thus overwhelmed him with their speeches, and enticed him by their flattering words, they seated him in the tent and cooked and sacrificed for him, and he ate of their sacrifice and of their bread.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>60</sup> They then gave him wine and he drank and became intoxicated, and they placed before him a beautiful damsel, and he did with her as he liked, for he knew not what he was doing, as he had drunk plentifully of wine.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>61</sup> Thus did the children of Moab to Israel in that place, in the plain of Shittim, and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel on account of this matter, and he sent a pestilence amongst them, and there died of the Israelites twenty-four thousand men.</p>
                      <p><sup>62</sup> Now there was a man of the children of Simeon whose name was Zimri, the son of Salu, who connected himself with the Midianite Cosbi, the daughter of Zur, king of Midian, in the sight of all the children of Israel.</p>
                      <p><sup>63</sup> And Phineas the son of Elazer, the son of Aaron the priest, saw this wicked thing which Zimri had done, and he took a spear and rose up and went after them, and pierced them both and slew them, and the pestilence ceased from the children of Israel.</p>
      


        <H2>Chapter 5</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> All over twenty years of age at the time of Leaving Egypt die at the Expiration of Forty Years. Israel is Numbered. The Midianites are destroyed, and their Spoil is Divided among the People.</p>

             
                                            
                      <p><sup>1</sup> At that time after the pestilence, the Lord said to Moses, and to Elazer the son of Aaron the priest, saying,</p>
                      <p><sup>2</sup> Number the heads of the whole community of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, all that went forth in the army.</p>
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And Moses and Elazer numbered the children of Israel after their families, and the number of all Israel was seven hundred thousand, seven hundred and thirty.</p>
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And the number of the children of Levi, from one month old and upward, was twenty-three thousand, and amongst these there was not a man of those numbered by Moses and Aaron in the wilderness of Sinai.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> For the Lord had told them that they would die in the wilderness, so they all died, and not one had been left of them excepting Caleb the son of Jephuneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</p>
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And it was after this that the Lord said to Moses, Say unto the children of Israel to avenge upon Midian the cause of their brethren the children of Israel.</p>
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And Moses did so, and the children of Israel chose from amongst them twelve thousand men, being one thousand to a tribe, and they went to Midian.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And the children of Israel warred against Midian, and they slew every male, also the five princes ofMidian, and Balaam the son of Beor did they slay with the sword.</p>
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And the children of Israel took the wives of Midian captive, with their little ones and their cattle, and all belonging to them.</p>
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And they took all the spoil and all the prey, and they brought it to Moses and to Elazer to the plains of Moab.</p>
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And Moses and Elazer and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them with joy.</p>
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And they divided all the spoil of Midian, and the children of Israel had been revenged upon Midian for the cause of their brethren the children of Israel.</p>
             

                                            
        <H2>Chapter 6</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Moses appoints Joshua his successor. The Lord encourages Joshua. Moses teaches the children of Israel to Walk in the Way of the Lord. He goes up to Mount Abarim and dies there.</p>


                             
                      <p><sup>1</sup> At that time the Lord said to Moses, Behold thy days are approaching to an end, take now Joshua the son of Nun thy servant and place him in the tabernacle, and I will command him, and Moses did so.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And the Lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood at the entrance of the tabernacle.</p>
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And the Lord commanded Joshua the son of Nun and said unto him, Be strong and courageous, for thou shalt bring the children of Israel to the land which I swore to give them, and I will be with thee.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And Moses said to Joshua, Be strong and courageous, for thou wilt make the children of Israel inherit the land, and the Lord will be with thee, he will not leave thee nor forsake thee, be not afraid nor disheartened.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And Moses called to all the children of Israel and said to them, You have seen all the good which the Lord your God has done for you in the wilderness.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>6</sup> Now therefore observe all the words of this law, and walk in the way of the Lord your God, turn not from the way which the Lord has commanded you, either to the right or to the left.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And Moses taught the children of Israel statutes and judgments and laws to do in the land as the Lord had commanded him.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And he taught them the way of the Lord and his laws; behold they are written upon the book of the law of God which he gave to the children of Israel by the hand of Moses.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And Moses finished commanding the children of Israel, and the Lord said to him, saying, Go up to the Mount Abarim and die there, and be gathered unto thy people as Aaron thy brother was gathered.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And Moses went up as the Lord had commanded him, and he died there in the land of Moab by the order of the Lord, in the fortieth year from the Israelites going forth from the land of Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days, and the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were completed.</p>
