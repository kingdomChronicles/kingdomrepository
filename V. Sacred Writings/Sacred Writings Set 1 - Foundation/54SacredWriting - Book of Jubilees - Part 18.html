<p class="chapterTitle">How to compute Jubilee years</p>
<p>
1 Jubilee  = 7 weeks <br>
1 Week     = 7 years <br>
1 Jubilee  = 49 years
</p>
<p>Sample Computation:</p>
<p>There are 49 Jubilees, 2 weeks and 2 years from Adam to the 40 days of Moses on Mt. Sinai.</p>
<p>
49 jubilees x 49 years / jubilee =    2401 years <br>
7 weeks x 7 years / week ----- =    49 years <br>
2 years------------------------- =     2  years 
</p>

<p>2,401 years + 49 years + 2 years = 2410 years from Adam to Mt Sinai when the Law was given to Moses </p>

<H2>Chapter 1</H2>

<p class="chapterTitle"> Joseph set over Potiphar's house, 1-4. His purity and imprisonment, 5-13. Imprisonment of
  Pharaoh's chief butler and chief baker whose dreams Joseph interprets, 14-18. (Cf. Gen.xxxvii.2;
  xxxix.3-8, 12-15, 17-23; xl.1-5, 21-3; xli.1.)</p>
                                                                                                                                                                            
      <p><sup>1</sup>And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings in the land of Canaan. These are the generations of Jacob.</p>
      <p><sup>2</sup>And Joseph was seventeen years old when they took him down into the land of Egypt, and Potiphar, an eunuch of Pharaoh, the chief cook bought him.</p>
      <p><sup>3</sup>And he set Joseph over all his house and the blessing of the Lord came upon the house of the Egyptian on account of Joseph, and the Lord prospered him in all that he did.</p>
      <p><sup>4</sup>And the Egyptian committed everything into the hands of Joseph; for he saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord prospered him in all that he did.</p>
      <p><sup>5</sup>And Joseph's appearance was comely [and very beautiful was his appearance], and his master's wife lifted up her eyes and saw Joseph, and she loved him and besought him to lie with her.</p>
      <p><sup>6</sup>But he did not surrender his soul, and he remembered the Lord and the words which Jacob, his father, used to read from amongst the words of Abraham, that no man should commit fornication with a woman who has a husband; that for him the punishment of death has been ordained in the heavens before the Most High God, and the sin will be recorded against him in the eternal books continually before the Lord.</p>
      <p><sup>7</sup>And Joseph remembered these words and refused to lie with her.</p>
      <p><sup>8</sup>And she besought him for a year, but he refused and would not listen.</p>
      <p><sup>9</sup>But she embraced him and held him fast in the house in order to force him to lie with her, and closed the doors of the house and held him fast; but he left his garment in her hands and broke through the door and fled without from her presence.</p>
      <p><sup>10</sup>And the woman saw that he would not lie with her, and she calumniated him in the presence of his lord, saying 'Thy Hebrew servant, whom thou lovest, sought to force me so that he might lie with me; and it came to pass when I lifted up my voice that he fled and left his garment in my hands when I held him, and he brake through the door.'</p>
      <p><sup>11</sup>And the Egyptian saw the garment of Joseph and the broken door, and heard the words of his wife, and cast Joseph into prison into the place where the prisoners were kept whom the king imprisoned.</p>
      <p><sup>12</sup> And he was there in the prison; and the Lord gave Joseph favour in the sight of the chief of the prison guards and compassion before him, for he saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper.</p>
      <p><sup>13</sup>And he committed all things into his hands, and the chief of the prison guards knew of nothing that was with him, for Joseph did every thing, and the Lord perfected it.</p>
      <p><sup>14</sup>And he remained there two years.  And in those days Pharaoh, king of Egypt was wroth against his two eunuchs, against the chief butler, and against the chief baker, and he put them in ward in the house of the chief cook, in the prison where Joseph was kept.</p>
      <p><sup>15</sup>And the chief of the prison guards appointed Joseph to serve them; and he served before them.</p>
      <p><sup>16</sup>And they both dreamed a dream, the chief butler and the chief baker, and they told it to Joseph.</p>
      <p><sup>17</sup>And as he interpreted to them so it befell them, and Pharaoh restored the chief butler to his office and the (chief) baker he slew, as Joseph had interpreted to them.</p>
      <p><sup>18</sup>But the chief butler forgot Joseph in the prison, although he had informed him what would befall him, and did not remember to inform Pharaoh how Joseph had told him, for he forgot.</p>
 

<H2>Chapter 2</H2>

<p class="chapterTitle"> Pharoah's dreams and their interpretation, 1-4. Elevation and marriage of Joseph, 5-13.
  (Cf. Gen. xli.1-5, 7-9, 14 seqq., 25, 29-30, 34, 36, 38-43, 45-46, 49.)</p>
                                                                                                                                              
      <p><sup>1</sup>And in those days Pharaoh dreamed two dreams in one night concerning a famine which was to be in all the land, and he awoke from his sleep and called all the interpreters of dreams that were in Egypt, and magicians, and told them his two dreams, and they were not able to declare (them).</p>
      <p><sup>2</sup>And then the chief butler remembered Joseph and spake of him to the king, and he brought him
      forth from the prison, and he told his two dreams before him.</p>
      <p><sup>3</sup>And he said before Pharaoh that his two dreams were one, and he said unto him:  'Seven years shall come (in which there shall be) plenty over all the land of Egypt, and after that seven years of famine, such a famine as has not been in all the land.</p>
      <p><sup>4</sup>And now let Pharaoh appoint overseers in all the land of Egypt, and let them store up food in every city throughout the days of the years of plenty, and there will be food for the seven years of famine, and the land will not perish through the famine, for it will be very severe.'</p>
      <p><sup>5</sup>And the Lord gave Joseph favour and mercy in the eyes of Pharaoh, and Pharaoh said unto his servants.  We shall not find such a wise and discreet man as this man, for the spirit of the Lord is with him.'</p>
      <p><sup>6</sup>And he appointed him the second in all his kingdom and gave him authority over all Egypt, and caused him to ride in the second chariot of Pharaoh.</p>
      <p><sup>7</sup>And he clothed him with byssus garments, and he put a gold chain upon his neck, and (a herald) proclaimed before him ' 'El 'El wa 'Abirer,' and placed a ring on his hand and made him ruler over all his house, and magnified him, and said unto him.  'Only on the throne shall I be greater than thou.'</p>
      <p><sup>8</sup>And Joseph ruled over all the land of Egypt, and all the princes of Pharaoh, and all his servants, and all who did the king's business loved him, for he walked in uprightness, for he was without pride and arrogance, and he had no respect of persons, and did not accept gifts, but he judged in uprightness all the people of the land.</p>
      <p><sup>9</sup>And the land of Egypt was at peace before Pharaoh because of Joseph, for the Lord was with him, and gave him favour and mercy for all his generations before all those who knew him and those who heard concerning him, and Pharaoh's kingdom was well ordered, and there was no Satan and no evil person (therein).</p>
      <p><sup>10</sup>And the king called Joseph's name Sephantiphans, and gave Joseph to wife the daughter of Potiphar, the daughter of the priest of Heliopolis, the chief cook.</p>
      <p><sup>11</sup>And on the day that Joseph stood before Pharaoh he was thirty years old [when he stood before Pharaoh].</p>
      <p><sup>12</sup>And in that year Isaac died.  And it came to pass as Joseph had said in the interpretation of his two dreams, according as he had said it, there were seven years of plenty over all the land of Egypt, and the land of Egypt abundantly produced, one measure (producing) eighteen hundred measures.</p>
      <p><sup>13</sup>And Joseph gathered food into every city until they were full of corn until they could no longer count and measure it for its multitude.</p>
  
  

<H2>Chapter 3</H2>

<p class="chapterTitle"> Judah's sons and Tamar, 1-7. Judah's incest with Tamar, 8-18. Tamar bears twins, 21-22. Judah forgiven, because he sinned ignorantly and repented when convicted, and because Tamar's marriage with his sons had not been consummated, 23-28. (Cf. Gen. xxxviii.6-18, 20-26, 29-30; xli.13.)</p>
                                                                                                                          
     
      <p><sup>1</sup>And in the forty-fifth jubilee, in the second week, (and) in the second year, [2165 A.M.] Judah took for his first-born Er, a wife from the daughters of Aram, named Tamar.</p>
      <p><sup>2</sup>But he hated, and did not lie with her, because his mother was of the daughters of Canaan, and he wished to take him a wife of the kinsfolk of his mother, but Judah, his father, would not permit him.</p>
      <p><sup>3</sup>And this Er, the first-born of Judah, was wicked, and the Lord slew him.</p>
      <p><sup>4</sup>And Judah said unto Onan, his brother 'Go in unto thy brother's wife and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her, and raise up seed unto thy brother.'</p>
      <p><sup>5</sup>And Onan knew that the seed would not be his, (but) his brother's only, and he went into the house of his brother's wife, and spilt the seed on the ground, and he was wicked in the eyes of the Lord, and He slew him.</p>
      <p><sup>6</sup>And Judah said unto Tamar, his daughter-in-law:  'Remain in thy father's house as a widow till Shelah my son be grown up, and I shall give thee to him to wife.'</p>
      <p><sup>7</sup>And he grew up; but Bedsu'el, the wife of Judah, did not permit her son Shelah to marry.  And Bedsu'el, the wife of Judah, died [2168 A.M.] in the fifth year of this week.</p>
      <p><sup>8</sup>And in the sixth year Judah went up to shear his sheep at Timnah. [2169 A.M.] And they told Tamar:  'Behold thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.'</p>
      <p><sup>9</sup>And she put off her widow's clothes, and put on a veil, and adorned herself, and sat in the gate adjoining the way to Timnah.</p> 
      <p><sup>10</sup>And as Judah was going along he found her, and thought her to be an harlot, and he said unto her:  'Let me come in unto thee'; and she said unto him Come in,' and he went in.</p>
      <p><sup>11</sup>And she said unto him:  'Give me my hire'; and he said unto her:  'I have nothing in my hand save my ring that is on my finger, and my necklace, and my staff which is in my hand.'</p>
      <p><sup>12</sup>And she said unto him 'Give them to me until thou dost send me my hire', and he said unto her:  'I will send unto thee a kid of the goats'; and he gave them to her, <em>and he went in unto her</em>, and she conceived by him.  </p>
      <p><sup>13</sup>And Judah went unto his sheep, and she went to her father's house.</p>
      <p><sup>14</sup>And Judah sent a kid of the goats by the hand of his shepherd, an Adullamite, and he found her not; and he asked the people of the place, saying:  'Where is the harlot who was here?' And they said unto him; 'There is no harlot here with us.'</p>
      <p><sup>15</sup>And he returned and informed him, and said unto him that he had not found her:  'I asked the people of the place, and they said unto me: "There is no harlot here." '</p>
      <p><sup>16</sup>And he said:  'Let her keep (them) lest we become a cause of derision.'  And when she had completed three months, it was manifest that she was with child, and they told Judah,
      saying:  'Behold Tamar, thy daughter-in-law, is with child by whoredom.'</p>
      <p><sup>17</sup>And Judah went to the house of her father, and said unto her father and her brothers:  'Bring her forth, and let them burn her, for she hath wrought uncleanness in Israel.'</p>
      <p><sup>18</sup>And it came to pass when they brought her forth to burn her that she sent to her father-in-law the ring and the necklace, and the staff, saying: 'Discern whose are these, for by him am I with child.'</p>
      <p><sup>19</sup>And Judah acknowledged, and said: 'Tamar is more righteous than I am.</p>
      <p><sup>20</sup>And therefore let them burn her not'  And for that reason she was not given to Shelah, and he did not again approach her.</p> 
      <p><sup>21</sup>And after that she bare two sons, Perez [2170 A.M.] and Zerah, in the seventh year of this second week.</p>
      <p><sup>22</sup>And thereupon the seven years of fruitfulness were accomplished, of which Joseph spake to Pharaoh.</p> 
      <p><sup>23</sup>And Judah acknowledged that the deed which he had done was evil, for he had lain with his daughter-in-law, and he esteemed it hateful in his eyes, and he acknowledged that he had transgressed and gone astray, for he had uncovered the skirt of his son, and he began to lament and to supplicate before the Lord because of his transgression.</p>
      <p><sup>24</sup>And we told him in a dream that it was forgiven him because he supplicated earnestly, and lamented, and did not again commit it.</p>
      <p><sup>25</sup>And he received forgiveness because he turned from his sin and from his ignorance, for he transgressed greatly before our God; and every one that acts thus, every one who lies with his mother-in-law, let them burn him with fire that he may burn therein, for there is uncleanness and pollution upon them, with fire let them burn them.</p>
      <p><sup>26</sup>And do thou command the children of Israel that there be no uncleanness amongst them, for every one who lies with his daughter-in-law or with his mother-in-law hath wrought uncleanness; with fire let them burn the man who has lain with her, and likewise the woman, and He will turn away wrath and punishment from Israel.</p>
      <p><sup>27</sup>And unto Judah we said that his two sons had not lain with her, and for this reason his seed was stablished for a second generation, and would not be rooted out.</p>
      <p><sup>28</sup>For in singleness of eye he had gone and sought for punishment, namely, according to the judgment of Abraham, which he had commanded his sons, Judah had sought to burn her with fire.</p>
  

<H2>Chapter 4</H2>

<p class="chapterTitle"> Owing to the famine Jacob sends his sons to Egypt for corn, 1-4. Joseph recognizes them and retains Simeon, and requires them to bring Benjamin when they returned, 5-12. Notwithstanding Jacob's reluctance his sons take Benjamin with them on their second journey and are entertained by Joseph, 13-25. (Cf. Gen. xli.54, 56; xlii.7-9, 13, 17, 20, 24-5, 29-30, 34-38; xliii.1-2, 4-5, 8-9, 11, 15, 23, 26, 29, 34; xliv. 1-2.)</p>
                                                                                                                                                    
      <p><sup>1</sup>And in the first year of the third week of the forty-fifth jubilee the famine began to come into the [2171 A.M.] land, and the rain refused to be given to the earth, for none whatever fell.</p>
      <p><sup>2</sup>And the earth grew barren, but in the land of Egypt there was food, for Joseph had gathered the seed of the land in the seven years of plenty and had preserved it.</p>
      <p><sup>3</sup>And the Egyptians came to Joseph that he might give them food, and he opened the store-houses where was the grain of the first year, and he sold it to the people of the land for gold.</p>
      <p><sup>4</sup>&lt;Now the famine was very sore in the land of Canaan&gt;, and Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt, and he sent his ten sons that they should procure food for him in Egypt; but Benjamin he did not send, and &lt;the ten sons of Jacob&gt; arrived &lt;in Egypt&gt; among those that went (there).</p>
      <p><sup>5</sup>And Joseph recognised them, but they did not recognise him, and he spake unto them and questioned them, and he said unto them; 'Are ye not spies and have ye not come to explore the approaches of the land?  'And he put them in ward.</p>
      <p><sup>6</sup>And after that he set them free again, and detained Simeon alone and sent off his nine brothers.</p>
      <p><sup>7</sup>And he filled their sacks with corn, and he put their gold in their sacks, and they did not know.</p>
      <p><sup>8</sup>And he commanded them to bring their younger brother, for they had told him their father was living and their younger brother.</p>
      <p><sup>9</sup>And they went up from the land of Egypt and they came to the land of Canaan; and they told their father all that had befallen them, and how the lord of the country had spoken roughly to them, and had seized Simeon till they should bring Benjamin.</p>
      <p><sup>10</sup>And Jacob said: 'Me have ye bereaved of my children!  Joseph is not and Simeon also is not, and ye will take Benjamin away. On me has your wickedness come.</p>
      <p><sup>11</sup>'And he said: 'My son will not go down with you lest perchance he fall sick; for their mother gave birth to two sons, and one has perished, and this one also ye will take from me.  If perchance he took a fever on the road, ye would bring down my old age with sorrow unto death.'</p>
      <p><sup>12</sup>For he saw that their money had been returned to every man in his sack, and for this reason he feared to send him.</p>
      <p><sup>13</sup>And the famine increased and became sore in the land of Canaan, and in all lands save in the land of Egypt, for many of the children of the Egyptians had stored up their seed for food from the time when they saw Joseph gathering seed together and putting it in storehouses and preserving it for the years of famine.</p>
      <p><sup>14</sup>And the people of Egypt fed themselves thereon during the first year of their famine.</p>
      <p><sup>15</sup>But when Israel saw that the famine was very sore in the land, and that there was no deliverance, he said unto his sons:  'Go again, and procure food for us that we die not.'</p>
      <p><sup>16</sup>And they said:  'We shall not go; unless our youngest brother go with us, we shall not go.'</p>
      <p><sup>17</sup>And Israel saw that if he did not send him with them, they should all perish by reason of the famine.</p>
      <p><sup>18</sup>And Reuben said: 'Give him into my hand, and if I do not bring him back to thee, slay my two sons instead of his soul.'</p>
      <p><sup>19</sup>And he said unto him: 'He shall not go with thee.' And Judah came near and said: 'Send him with me, and if I do not bring him back to thee, let me bear the blame before thee all the days of my life.'</p> 
      <p><sup>20</sup>And he sent him with them in the second year of this week on the [2172 A.m.] first day of the month, and they came to the land of Egypt with all those who went, and (they had) presents in their hands, stacte and almonds and terebinth nuts and pure honey.</p>
      <p><sup>21</sup>And they went and stood before Joseph, and he saw Benjamin his brother, and he knew him, and said unto them:  Is this your youngest brother?'  And they said unto him:  'It is he.'  And he said The Lord be gracious to thee, my son!'</p>
      <p><sup>22</sup>And he sent him into his house and he brought forth Simeon unto them and he made a feast for them, and they presented to him the gift which they had brought in their hands.</p>
      <p><sup>23</sup>And they eat before him and he gave them all a portion, but the portion of Benjamin was seven times larger than that of any of theirs.</p>
      <p><sup>24</sup>And they eat and drank and arose and remained with their asses.</p>
      <p><sup>25</sup>And Joseph devised a plan whereby he might learn their thoughts as to whether thoughts of peace prevailed amongst them, and he said to the steward who was over his house:  'Fill all their sacks with food, and return their money unto them into their vessels, and my cup, the silver cup out of which I drink, put it in the sack of the youngest, and send them away.'</p>
  


<H2>Chapter 5</H2>

    <p class="chapterTitle"> Joseph's plan to stay his brethren, 1-10. Judah's supplication, 11-13. Joseph makes himself known to his brethren and sends them back for his father, 14-24. (Cf. Gen. xliv.3-10, 12-18, 27-8, 30-32; xlv.1-2, 5-9, 12, 18, 20-21, 23, 25-28.)</p>


  
      <p><sup>1</sup>And he did as Joseph had told him, and filled all their sacks for them with food and put their money in their sacks, and put the cup in Benjamin's sack.</p>
      <p><sup>2</sup>And early in the morning they departed, and it came to pass that, when they had gone from thence, Joseph said unto the steward of his house:  'Pursue them, run and seize them, saying, "For good ye have requited me with evil; you have stolen from me the silver cup out of which my lord drinks."  And bring back to me their youngest brother, and fetch (him) quickly before I go forth to my seat of judgment.'</p>
      <p><sup>3</sup>And he ran after them and said unto them according to these words.</p>
      <p><sup>4</sup>And they said unto him: 'God forbid that thy servants should do this thing, and steal from the house of thy lord any utensil, and the money also which we found in our sacks the first time, we thy servants brought back from the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p><sup>5</sup>How then should we steal any utensil?  Behold here are we and our sacks search, and wherever thou findest the cup in the sack of any man amongst us, let him be slain, and we and our asses will serve thy lord.'</p>
      <p><sup>6</sup>And he said unto them: 'Not so, the man with whom I find, him only shall I take as a servant, and ye shall return in peace unto your house.'</p>
      <p><sup>7</sup>And as he was searching in their vessels, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest, it was found in Benjamin's sack.</p>
      <p><sup>8</sup>And they rent their garments, and laded their asses, and returned to the city and came to the house of Joseph, and they all bowed themselves on their faces to the ground before him.</p>
      <p><sup>9</sup>And Joseph said unto them: 'Ye have done evil.'  And they said:  'What shall we say and how shall we defend ourselves?  Our lord hath discovered the transgression of his servants; behold we are the servants of our lord, and our asses also.</p>
      <p><sup>10</sup>'And Joseph said unto them:  'I too fear the Lord; as for you, go ye to your homes and let your brother be my servant, for ye have done evil. Know ye not that a man delights in his cup as I with this cup?  And yet ye have stolen it from me.'</p>
      <p><sup>11</sup>And Judah said:  'O my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ear two brothers did thy servant's mother bear to our father:  one went away and was lost, and hath not been found, and he alone is left of his mother, and thy servant our father loves him, and his life also is bound up with the life of this (lad).</p>
      <p><sup>12</sup>And it will come to pass, when we go to thy servant our father, and the lad is not with us, that he will die, and we shall bring down our father with sorrow unto death.</p>
      <p><sup>13</sup>Now rather let me, thy servant, abide instead of the boy as a bondsman unto my lord, and let the lad go with his brethren, for I became surety for him at the hand of thy servant our father, and if I do not bring him back, thy servant will hear the blame to our father for ever.'</p>
      <p><sup>14</sup>And Joseph saw that they were all accordant in goodness one with another, and he could not refrain himself, and he told them that he was Joseph.</p>
      <p><sup>15</sup>And he conversed with them in the Hebrew tongue and fell on their neck and wept.</p>
      <p><sup>16</sup>But they knew him not and they began to weep.  And he said unto them: 'Weep not over me, but hasten and bring my father to me; and ye see that it is my mouth that speaketh and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see.</p>
      <p><sup>17</sup>For behold this is the second year of the famine, and there are still five years without harvest or fruit of trees or ploughing.</p>
      <p><sup>18</sup>Come down quickly ye and your households, so that ye perish not through the famine, and do not be grieved for your possessions, for the Lord sent me before you to set things in order that many people might live.</p>
      <p><sup>19</sup>And tell my father that I am still alive, and ye, behold, ye see that the Lord has made me as a father to Pharaoh, and ruler over his house and over all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p><sup>20</sup>And tell my father of all my glory, and all the riches and glory that the Lord hath given me.'</p>
      <p><sup>21</sup>And by the command of the mouth of Pharaoh he gave them chariots and provisions for the way, and he gave them all many-coloured raiment and silver.</p>
      <p><sup>22</sup>And to their father he sent raiment and silver and ten asses which carried corn, and he sent them away.</p>
      <p><sup>23</sup>And they went up and told their father that Joseph was alive, and was measuring out corn to all the nations of the earth, and that he was ruler over all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p><sup>24</sup>And their father did not believe it, for he was beside himself in his mind; but when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent, the life of his spirit revived, and he said: 'It is enough for me if Joseph lives; I will go down and see him before I die.'</p>

<H2>Chapter 7</H2>

<p class="chapterTitle"> Joseph receives Jacob, and gives him Goshen, 1-7. Joseph acquires all the land and its inhabitants for Pharaoh, 8-12. Jacob dies and is buried in Hebron, 13-15. His books given to Levi, 16. (Cf. Gen. xlvi.28-30; xlvii.11-13, 19, 20, 23, 24, 28; l.13.)</p>
                                                                                                                              
      
      <p><sup>1</sup> And Israel went into the country of Egypt, into the land of Goshen, on the new moon of the fourth [2172 A.M]. month, in the second year of the third week of the forty-fifth jubilee.</p>
      <p><sup>2</sup>And Joseph went to meet his father Jacob, to the land of Goshen, and he fell on his father's neck and wept.</p>
      <p><sup>3</sup>And Israel said unto Joseph: 'Now let me die since I have seen thee, and now may the Lord God of Israel be blessed the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac who hath not withheld His mercy and His grace from His servant Jacob.</p>
      <p><sup>4</sup>It is enough for me that I have seen thy face whilst I am yet alive; yea, true is the vision which I saw at Bethel.  Blessed be the Lord my God for ever and ever, and blessed be His name.'</p>
      <p><sup>5</sup>And Joseph and his brothers eat bread before their father and drank wine, and Jacob rejoiced with exceeding great joy because he saw Joseph eating with his brothers and drinking before him, and he blessed the Creator of all things who had preserved him, and had preserved for him his twelve sons.</p>
      <p><sup>6</sup>And Joseph had given to his father and to his brothers as a gift the right of dwelling in the land of Goshen and in Rameses and all the region round about, which he ruled over before Pharaoh.  And Israel and his sons dwelt in the land of Goshen, the best part of the land of Egypt and Israel was one hundred and thirty years old when he came into Egypt.</p>
      <p><sup>7</sup>And Joseph nourished his father and his brethren and also their possessions with bread as much as sufficed them for the seven years of the famine.</p>
      <p><sup>8</sup>And the land of Egypt suffered by reason of the famine, and Joseph acquired all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh in return for food, and he got possession of the people and their cattle and everything for Pharaoh.</p>
      <p><sup>9</sup>And the years of the famine were accomplished, and Joseph gave to the people in the land seed and food that they might sow (the land) in the eighth year, for the river had overflowed all the land of Egypt. </p>
      <p><sup>10</sup>For in the seven years of the famine it had (not) overflowed and had irrigated only a few places on the banks of the river, but now it overflowed and the Egyptians sowed the land, and it bore much corn that year.</p>
      <p><sup>11</sup>And this was the first year of [2178 A.M.] the fourth week of the forty-fifth jubilee.</p>
      <p><sup>12</sup>And Joseph took of the corn of the harvest the fifth part for the king and left four parts for them for food and for seed, and Joseph made it an ordinance for the land of Egypt until this day.</p>
      <p><sup>13</sup>And Israel lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and all the days which he lived were three jubilees, one hundred and forty-seven years, and he died in the fourth [2188 A.M.] year of the fifth week of the forty-fifth jubilee.</p>
      <p><sup>14</sup>And Israel blessed his sons before he died and told them everything that would befall them in the land of Egypt; and he made known to them what would come upon them in the last days, and blessed them and gave to Joseph two portions in the land.</p>
      <p><sup>15</sup>And he slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the double cave in the land of Canaan, near Abraham his father in the grave which he dug for himself in the double cave in the land of Hebron.</p>
      <p><sup>16</sup>And he gave all his books and the books of his fathers to Levi his son that he might preserve them and renew them for his children until this day.</p>
