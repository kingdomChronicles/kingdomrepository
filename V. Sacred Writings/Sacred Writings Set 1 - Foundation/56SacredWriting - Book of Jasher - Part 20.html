        <H2>Chapter 1</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> After Seventeen Years' Dwelling in Egypt, Jacob dies, after Blessing his Children and commanding them to go in the Way of the Lord. Joseph and his Brethren and all the Mighty Men of Egypt go up to Canaan to Bury Jacob. Esau, claiming the Land of Canaan as his, will not Allow Joseph to Bury his Father. After Esau and many of his People are slain, Jacob is Buried by Force. All the Kings of Canaan come up to do him Honor.</p>
                    
          
                    
                              
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and the days of Jacob, and the years of his life were a hundred and forty seven years.</p>
                      <p><sup>2</sup> At that time Jacob was attacked with that illness of which he died and he sent and called for his son Joseph from Egypt, and Joseph his son came from Egypt and Joseph came unto his father.</p>
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And Jacob said unto Joseph and unto his sons, Behold I die, and the God of your ancestors will visit you, and bring you back to the land, which the Lord sware to give unto you and unto your children after you, now therefore when I am dead, bury me in the cave which is in
                      Machpelah in Hebron in the land of Canaan, near my ancestors.</p>
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And Jacob made his sons swear to bury him in Machpelah, in Hebron, and his sons swore unto him concerning this thing.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And he commanded them, saying, Serve the Lord your God, for he who delivered your fathers will also deliver you from all trouble.</p>
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And Jacob said, Call all your children unto me, and all the children of Jacob's sons came and sat before him, and Jacob blessed them, and he said unto them, The Lord God of your fathers shall grant you a thousand times as much and bless you, and may he give you the blessing of your father Abraham; and all the children of Jacob's sons went forth on that day after he had blessed them.</p>
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And on the next day Jacob again called for his sons, and they all assembled and came to him and sat before him, and Jacob on that day blessed his sons before his death, each man did he bless according to his blessing; behold it is written in the book of the law of the Lord
                      appertaining to Israel.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And Jacob said unto Judah, I know my son that thou art a mighty man for thy brethren; reign over them, and thy sons shall reign over their sons forever.</p>
                      <p><sup>9</sup> Only teach thy sons the bow and all the weapons of war, in order that they may fight the battles of their brother who will rule over his enemies.</p>
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And Jacob again commanded his sons on that day, saying, Behold I shall be this day gathered unto my people; carry me up from Egypt, and bury me in the cave of Machpelah as I have commanded you.</p>
                      <p><sup>11</sup> Howbeit take heed I pray you that none of your sons carry me, only yourselves, and this is the manner you shall do unto me, when you carry my body to go with it to the land of Canaan to bury me,</p>
                      <p><sup>12</sup> Judah, Issachar and Zebulun shall carry my bier at the eastern side; Reuben, Simeon and Gad at the south, Ephraim, Manasseh and Benjamin at the west, Dan, Asher and Naphtali at the north.</p>
                      <p><sup>13</sup> Let not Levi carry with you, for he and his sons will carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord with the Israelites in the camp, neither let Joseph my son carry, for as a king so let his glory be; howbeit, Ephraim and Manasseh shall be in their stead.</p>
                      <p><sup>14</sup> Thus shall you do unto me when you carry me away; do not neglect any thing of all that I command you; and it shall come to pass when you do this unto me, that the Lord will remember you favorably and your children after you forever.</p>
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And you my sons, honor each his brother and his relative, and command your children and your children's children after you to serve the Lord God of your ancestors all the days.</p>
                      <p><sup>16</sup> In order that you may prolong your days in the land, you and your children and your children's children for ever, when you do what is good and upright in the sight of the Lord your God, to go in all his ways.</p>
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And thou, Joseph my son, forgive I pray thee the prongs of thy brethren and all their misdeeds in the injury that they heaped upon thee, for God intended it for thine and thy children's benefit.</p>
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And O my son leave not thy brethren to the inhabitants of Egypt, neither hurt their feelings, for behold I consign them to the hand of God and in thy hand to guard them from the Egyptians; and the sons of Jacob answered their father saying, O, our father, all that thou
                      hast commanded us, so will we do; may God only be with us.</p>
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And Jacob said unto his sons, So may God be with you when you keep all his ways; turn not from his ways either to the right or the left in performing what is good and upright in his sight.</p>
                      <p><sup>20</sup> For I know that many and grievous troubles will befall you in the latter days in the land, yea your children and children's children, only serve the Lord and he will save you from all trouble.</p>
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And it shall come to pass when you shall go after God to serve him and will teach your children after you, and your children's children, to know the Lord, then will the Lord raise up unto you and your children a servant from amongst your children, and the Lord will deliver you through his hand from all affliction, and bring you out of Egypt and bring you back to the land of your fathers to inherit it securely.</p>
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And Jacob ceased commanding his sons, and he drew his feet into the bed, he died and was gathered to his people.</p>
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And Joseph fell upon his father and he cried out and wept over him and he kissed him, and he called out in a bitter voice, and he said, O my father, my father.</p>
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And his son's wives and all his household came and fell upon Jacob, and they wept over him, and cried in a very loud voice concerning Jacob.</p>
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And all the sons of Jacob rose up together, and they tore their garments, and they all put sackcloth upon their loins, and they fell upon their faces, and they cast dust upon their heads toward the heavens.</p>
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And the thing was told unto Osnath Joseph's wife, and she rose up and put on a sack and she with all the Egyptian women with her came and mourned and wept for Jacob.</p>
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And also all the people of Egypt who knew Jacob came all on that day when they heard this thing, and all Egypt wept for many days.</p>
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And also from the land of Canaan did the women come unto Egypt when they heard that Jacob was dead, and they wept for him in Egypt for seventy days.</p>
                      <p><sup>29</sup> And it came to pass after this that Joseph commanded his servants the doctors to embalm his father with myrrh and frankincense and all manner of incense and perfume, and the doctors embalmed Jacob as Joseph had commanded them.</p>
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And all the people of Egypt and the elders and all the inhabitants of the land of Goshen wept and mourned over Jacob, and all his sons and the children of his household lamented and mourned over their father Jacob many days.</p>
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And after the days of his weeping had passed away, at the end of seventy days, Joseph said unto Pharaoh, I will go up and bury my father in the land of Canaan as he made me swear, and then I will return.</p>
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And Pharaoh sent Joseph, saying, Go up and bury thy father as he said, and as he made thee swear; and Joseph rose up with all his brethren to go to the land of Canaan to bury their father Jacob as he had commanded them.</p>
                      <p><sup>33</sup> And Pharaoh commanded that it should be proclaimed throughout Egypt, saying, Whoever goeth not up with Joseph and his brethren to the land of Canaan to bury Jacob, shall die.</p>
                      <p><sup>34</sup> And all Egypt heard of Pharaoh's proclamation, and they all rose up together, and all the servants of Pharaoh, and the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt went up with Joseph, and all the officers and nobles of Pharaoh went up as the servants of  Joseph, and they went to bury Jacob in the land of Canaan.</p>
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And the sons of Jacob carried the bier upon which he lay; according to all that their father commanded them, so did his sons unto him.</p>
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And the bier was of pure gold, and it was inlaid round about with onyx stones and bdellium; and the covering of the bier was gold woven work, joined with threads, and over them were hooks of onyx stones and bdellium.</p>
                      <p><sup>37</sup> And Joseph placed upon the head of his father Jacob a large golden crown, and he put a golden scepter in his hand, and they surrounded the bier as was the custom of kings during their lives.</p>
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And all the troops of Egypt went before him in this array, at first all the mighty men of Pharaoh, and the mighty men of Joseph, and after them the rest of the inhabitants of Egypt, and they were all girded with swords and equipped with coats of mail, and the trappings of
                      war were upon them.</p>
                      <p><sup>39</sup> And all the weepers and mourners went at a distance opposite to the bier, going and weeping and lamenting, and the rest of the people went after the bier.</p>
                      <p><sup>40</sup> And Joseph and his household went together near the bier barefooted and weeping, and the rest of Joseph's servants went around him; each man had his ornaments upon him, and they were all armed with their weapons of war.</p>
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And fifty of Jacob's servants went in front of the bier, and they strewed along the road myrrh and aloes, and all manner of perfume, and all the sons of Jacob that carried the bier walked upon the perfumery, and the servants of Jacob went before them strewing the perfume along the road.</p>
                      <p><sup>42</sup> And Joseph went up with a heavy camp, and they did after this manner every day until they reached the land of Canaan, and they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which was on the other side of Jordan, and they mourned an exceeding great and heavy mourning in that place.</p>
                      <p><sup>43</sup> And all the kings of Canaan heard of this thing and they all went forth, each man from his house, thirty-one kings of Canaan, and they all came with their men to mourn and weep over Jacob.</p>
                      <p><sup>44</sup> And all these kings beheld Jacob's bier, and behold Joseph's crown was upon it, and they also put their crowns upon the bier, and encircled it with crowns.</p>
                      <p><sup>45</sup> And all these kings made in that place a great and heavy mourning with the sons of Jacob and Egypt over Jacob, for all the kings of Canaan knew the valor of Jacob and his sons.</p>
                      <p><sup>46</sup> And the report reached Esau, saying, Jacob died in Egypt, and his sons and all Egypt are conveying him to the land of Canaan to bury him.</p>
                      <p><sup>47</sup> And Esau heard this thing, and he was dwelling in mount Seir, and he rose up with his sons and all his people and all his household, a people exceedingly great, and they came to mourn and weep over Jacob.</p>
                      <p><sup>48</sup> And it came to pass, when Esau came he mourned for his brother Jacob, and all Egypt and all Canaan again rose up and mourned a great mourning with Esau over Jacob in that place</p>
                      <p><sup>49</sup> And Joseph and his brethren brought their father Jacob from that place, and they went to Hebron to bury Jacob in the cave by his fathers.</p>
                      <p><sup>50</sup> And they came unto Kireath-arba, to the cave, and as they came Esau stood with his sons against Joseph and his brethren as a hindrance in the cave, saying, Jacob shall not be buried therein, for it belongeth to us and to our father.</p>
                      <p><sup>51</sup> And Joseph and his brethren heard the words of Esau's sons, and they were exceedingly wroth, and Joseph approached unto Esau, saying, What is this thing which they have spoken? surely my father Jacob bought it from thee for great riches after the death of Isaac, now five and twenty years ago, and also all the land of Canaan he bought from thee and from thy sons, and thy seed after thee.</p>
                      <p><sup>52</sup> And Jacob bought it for his sons and his seed after him for an inheritance for ever, and why speakest thou these things this day?</p>
                      <p><sup>53</sup> And Esau answered, saying, Thou speakest falsely and utterest lies, for I sold not anything belonging to me in all this land, as thou sayest, neither did my brother Jacob buy aught belonging to me in this land.</p>
                      <p><sup>54</sup> And Esau spoke these things in order to deceive Joseph with his words, for Esau knew that Joseph was not present in those days when Esau sold all belonging to him in the land of Canaan to Jacob.</p>
                      <p><sup>55</sup> And Joseph said unto Esau, Surely my father inserted these things with thee in the record of purchase, and testified the record with witnesses, and behold it is with us in Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>56</sup> And Esau answered, saying unto him, Bring the record, all that thou wilt find in the record, so will we do.</p>
                      <p><sup>57</sup> And Joseph called unto Naphtali his brother, and he said, Hasten quickly, stay not, and run I pray thee to Egypt and bring all the records; the record of the purchase, the sealed record and the open record, and also all the first records in which all the transactions of the birth-right are written, fetch thou.</p>
                      <p><sup>58</sup> And thou shalt bring them unto us hither, that we may know from them all the words of Esau and his sons which they spoke this day.</p>
                      <p><sup>59</sup> And Naphtali hearkened to the voice of Joseph and he hastened and ran to go down to Egypt, and Naphtali was lighter on foot than any of the stags that were upon the wilderness, for he would go upon ears of corn without crushing them.</p>
                      <p><sup>60</sup> And when Esau saw that Naphtali had gone to fetch the records, he and his sons increased their resistance against the cave, and Esau and all his people rose up against Joseph and his brethren to battle.</p>
                      <p><sup>61</sup> And all the sons of Jacob and the people of Egypt fought with Esau and his men, and the sons of Esau and his people were smitten before the sons of Jacob, and the sons of Jacob slew of Esau's people forty men.</p>
                      <p><sup>62</sup> And Chushim the son of Dan, the son of Jacob, was at that time with Jacob's sons, but he was about a hundred cubits distant from the place of battle, for he remained with the children of Jacob's sons by Jacob's bier to guard it.</p>
                      <p><sup>63</sup> And Chushim was dumb and deaf, still he understood the voice of consternation amongst men.</p>
                      <p><sup>64</sup> And he asked, saying, Why do you not bury the dead, and what is this great consternation? and they answered him the words of Esau and his sons; and he ran to Esau in the midst of the battle, and he slew Esau with a sword, and he cut off his head, and it sprang to a distance, and Esau fell amongst the people of the battle.</p>
                      <p><sup>65</sup> And when Chushim did this thing the sons of Jacob prevailed over the sons of Esau, and the sons of Jacob buried their father Jacob by force in the cave, and the sons of Esau beheld it.</p>
                      <p><sup>66</sup> And Jacob was buried in Hebron, in the cave of Machpelah which Abraham had bought from the sons of Heth for the possession of a burial place, and he was buried in very costly garments.</p>
                      <p><sup>67</sup> And no king had such honor paid him as Joseph paid unto his father at his death, for he buried him with great honor like unto the burial of kings.</p>
                      <p><sup>68</sup> And Joseph and his brethren made a mourning of seven days for their father.</p>
              
                    

        <H2>Chapter 2</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> The Sons of Esau make war with the Sons of Jacob and are smitten. Some are taken captive to Egypt. The Children of Esau enlist the People of Seir to Accompany them to Egypt to Deliver their Brethren. Joseph and his Brethren and the Egyptians slay Six Hundred Thousand. Nearly all the Mighty Men of Seir being Slain, they make war with the Children of Esau to Drive them from their Land. Esau prevails and utterly annihilates the
          Children of Seir.</p>

          
              
                    
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And it was after this that the sons of Esau waged war with the sons of Jacob, and the sons of Esau fought with the sons of Jacob in Hebron, and Esau was still lying dead, and not buried.</p>
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And the battle was heavy between them, and the sons of Esau were smitten before the sons of Jacob, and the sons of Jacob slew of the sons of Esau eighty men, and not one died of the people of the sons of Jacob; and the hand of Joseph prevailed over all the people of
                      the sons of Esau, and he took Zepho, the son of Eliphaz, the son of Esau, and fifty of his men captive, and he bound them with chains of iron, and gave them into the hand of his servants to bring them to Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And it came to pass when the sons of Jacob had taken Zepho and his people captive, all those that remained were greatly afraid of their lives from the house of Esau, lest they should also be taken captive, and they all fled with Eliphaz the son of Esau and his people, with
                      Esau's body, and they went on their road to Mount Seir.</p>
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And they came unto Mount Seir and they buried Esau in Seir, but they had not brought his head with them to Seir, for it was buried in that place where the battle had been in Hebron.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And it came to pass when the sons of Esau had fled from before the sons of Jacob, the sons of Jacob pursued them unto the borders of Seir, but they did not slay a single man from amongst them when they pursued them, for Esau's body which they carried with them excited
                      their confusion, so they fled and the sons of Jacob turned back from them and came up to the place where their brethren were in Hebron, and they remained there on that day, and on the next day until they rested from the battle.</p>
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And it came to pass on the third day they assembled all the sons of Seir the Horite, and they assembled all the children of the east, a multitude of people like the sand of the sea, and they went and came down to Egypt to fight with Joseph and his brethren, in order to deliver their brethren.</p>
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And Joseph and all the sons of Jacob heard that the sons of Esau and the children of the east had come upon them to battle in order to deliver their brethren.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And Joseph and his brethren and the strong men of Egypt went forth and fought in the city of Rameses, and Joseph and his brethren dealt out a tremendous blow amongst the sons of Esau and the children of the east.</p>
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And they slew of them six hundred thousand men, and they slew amongst them all the mighty men of the children of Seir the Horite; there were only a few of them left, and they slew also a great many of the children of the east, and of the children of Esau; and Eliphaz the son
                      of Esau, and the children of the east all fled before Joseph and his brethren.</p>
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And Joseph and his brethren pursued them until they came unto Succoth, and they yet slew of them in Succoth thirty men, and the rest escaped and they fled each to his city.</p>
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And Joseph and his brethren and the mighty men of Egypt turned back from them with joy and cheerfulness of heart, for they had smitten all their enemies.</p>
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And Zepho the son of Eliphaz and his men were still slaves in Egypt to the sons of Jacob, and their pains increased.</p>
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And when the sons of Esau and the sons of Seir returned to their land, the sons of Seir saw that they had all fallen into the hands of the sons of Jacob, and the people of Egypt, on account of the battle of the sons of Esau.</p>
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And the sons of Seir said unto the sons of Esau, You have seen and therefore you know that this camp was on your account, and not one mighty man or an adept in war remaineth.</p>
                      <p><sup>15</sup> Now therefore go forth from our land, go from us to the land of Canaan to the land of the dwelling of your fathers; wherefore shall your children inherit the effects of our children in latter days?</p>
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And the children of Esau would not listen to the children of Seir, and the children of Seir considered to make war with them.</p>
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And the children of Esau sent secretly to Angeas king of Africa, the same is Dinhabah, saying,</p>
                      <p><sup>18</sup> Send unto us some of thy men and let them come unto us, and we will fight together with the children of Seir the Horite, for they have resolved to fight with us to drive us away from the land.</p>
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And Angeas king of Dinhabah did so, for he was in those days friendly to the children of Esau, and Angeas sent five hundred valiant infantry to the children of Esau, and eight hundred cavalry.</p>
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And the children of Seir sent unto the children of the east and unto the children of Midian, saying, You have seen what the children of Esau have done unto us, upon whose account we are almost all destroyed, in their battle with the sons of Jacob.</p>
                      <p><sup>21</sup> Now therefore come unto us and assist us, and we will fight them together, and we will drive them from the land and be avenged of the cause of our brethren who died for their sakes in their battle with their brethren the sons of Jacob.</p>
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And all the children of the east listened to the children of Seir, and they came unto them about eight hundred men with drawn swords, and the children of Esau fought with the children of Seir at that time in the wilderness of Paran.</p>
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And the children of Seir prevailed then over the sons of Esau, and the children of Seir slew on that day of the children of Esau in that battle about two hundred men of the people of Angeas king of Dinhabah.</p>
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And on the second day the children of Esau came again to fight a second time with the children of Seir, and the battle was sore upon the children of Esau this second time, and it troubled them greatly on account of the children of Seir.</p>
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And when the children of Esau saw that the children of Seir were more powerful than they were, some men of the children of Esau turned and assisted the children of Seir their enemies.</p>
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And there fell yet of the people of the children of Esau in the second battle fifty-eight men of the people at Angeas king of Dinhabah.</p>
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And on the third day the children of Esau heard that some of their brethren had turned from them to fight against them in the second battle; and the children of Esau mourned when they heard this thing.</p>
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And they said, What shall we do unto our brethren who turned from us to assist the children of Seir our enemies? and the children of Esau again sent to Angeas king of Dinhabah, saying,</p>
                      <p><sup>29</sup> Send unto us again other men that with them we may fight with the children of Seir, for they have already twice been heavier than we were.</p>
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And Angeas again sent to the children of Esau about six hundred valiant men, and they came to assist the children of Esau.</p>
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And in ten days' time the children of Esau again waged war with the children of Seir in the wilderness of Paran, and the battle was very severe upon the children of Seir, and the children of Esau prevailed at this time over the children of Seir, and the children of Seir were smitten before the children of Esau, and the children of Esau slew from them about two thousand men.</p>
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And all the mighty men of the children of Seir died in this battle, and there only remained their young children that were left in their cities.</p>
                      <p><sup>33</sup> And all Midian and the children of the east betook themselves to flight from the battle, and they left the children of Seir and fled when they saw that the battle was severe upon them, and the children of Esau pursued all the children of the east until they reached their land.</p>
                      <p><sup>34</sup> And the children of Esau slew yet of them about two hundred and fifty men and from the people of the children of Esau there fell in that battle about thirty men, but this evil came upon them through their brethren turning from them to assist the children of Seir the Horite, and the children of Esau again heard of the evil doings of their brethren, and they again mourned on account of this thing.</p>
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And it came to pass after the battle, the children of Esau turned back and came home unto Seir, and the children of Esau slew those who had remained in the land of the children of Seir; they slew also their wives and little ones, they left not a soul alive except fifty young lads and damsels whom they suffered to live, and the children of Esau did not put them to death, and the lads became their slaves, and the damsels they took for wives.</p>
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And the children of Esau dwelt in Seir in the place of the children of Seir, and they inherited their land and took possession of
                      it.</p>
                      <p><sup>37</sup> And the children of Esau took all belonging in the land to the children of Seir, also their flocks, their bullocks and their goods, and all belonging to the children of Seir, did the children of Esau take, and the children of Esau dwelt in Seir in the place of the children of Seir unto this day, and the children of Esau divided the land into divisions to the five sons of Esau, according to their families.</p>
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And it came to pass in those days, that the children of Esau resolved to crown a king over them in the land of which they became possessed. And they said to each other, Not so, for he shall reign over us in our land, and we shall be under his counsel and he shall fight our
                      battles, against our enemies, and they did so.</p>
                      <p><sup>39</sup> And all the children of Esau swore, saying, That none of their brethren should ever reign over them, but a strange man who is not of their brethren, for the souls of all the children of Esau were embittered every man against his son, brother and friend, on account of the evil they sustained from their brethren when they fought with the children of Seir.</p>
                      <p><sup>40</sup> Therefore the sons of Esau swore, saying, From that day forward they would not choose a king from their brethren, but one from a strange land unto this day.</p>
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And there was a man there from the people of Angeas king of Dinhabah; his name was Bela the son of Beor, who was a very valiant man, beautiful and comely and wise in all wisdom, and a man of sense and counsel; and there was none of the people of Angeas like unto him.</p>
                      <p><sup>42</sup> And all the children of Esau took him and anointed him and they crowned him for a king, and they bowed down to him, and they said unto him, May the king live, may the king live.</p>
                      <p><sup>43</sup> And they spread out the sheet, and they brought him each man earrings of gold and silver or rings or bracelets, and they made him very rich in silver and in gold, in onyx stones and bdellium, and they made him a royal throne, and they placed a regal crown upon his head,
                      and they built a palace for him and he dwelt therein, and he became king over all the children of Esau.</p>
                      <p><sup>44</sup> And the people of Angeas took their hire for their battle from the children of Esau, and they went and returned at that time to their master in Dinhabah.</p>
                      <p><sup>45</sup> And Bela reigned over the children of Esau thirty years, and the children of Esau dwelt in the land instead of the children of Seir, and they dwelt securely in their stead unto this day.</p>


                 
        <H2>Chapter 3</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Pharaoh dies and the whole Government of Egypt devolves upon Joseph, Pharaoh the Younger being but a nominal Ruler. The Children of Esau again come Against the Israelites, and are again smitten.</p>                  

        

                      <p><sup>1</sup> And it came to pass in the thirty-second year of the Israelites going down to Egypt, that is in the seventy-first year of the life of Joseph, in that year died Pharaoh king of Egypt, and Magron his son reigned in his stead.</p>
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And Pharaoh commanded Joseph before his death to be a father to his son, Magron, and that Magron should be under the care of Joseph and under his counsel.</p>
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And all Egypt consented to this thing that Joseph should be king over them, for all the Egyptians loved Joseph as of heretofore, only Magron the son of Pharaoh sat upon, his father's throne, and he became king in those days in his father's stead.</p>
                      <p><sup>4</sup> Magron was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and forty years he reigned in Egypt, and all Egypt called his name Pharaoh after the name of his father, as it was their custom to do in Egypt to every king that reigned over them.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And it came to pass when Pharaoh reigned in his father's stead, he placed the laws of Egypt and all the affairs of government in the hand of Joseph, as his father had commanded him.</p>
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And Joseph became king over Egypt, for he superintended over all Egypt, and all Egypt was under his care and under his counsel, for all Egypt inclined to Joseph after the death of Pharaoh, and they loved him exceedingly to reign over them.</p>
                      <p><sup>7</sup> But there were some people amongst them, who did not like him, saying, No stranger shall reign over us; still the whole  government of Egypt devolved in those days upon Joseph, after the death of Pharaoh, he being the regulator, doing as he liked throughout the land without any one interfering.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And all Egypt was under the care of Joseph, and Joseph made war with all his surrounding enemies, and he subdued them; also all the land and all the Philistines, unto the borders of Canaan, did Joseph subdue, and they were all under his power and they gave a yearly tax
                      unto Joseph.</p>
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And Pharaoh king of Egypt sat upon his throne in his father's stead, but he was under the control and counsel of Joseph, as he was at first under the control of his father.</p>
                      <p><sup>10</sup> Neither did he reign but in the land of Egypt only, under the counsel of Joseph, but Joseph reigned over the whole country at that time, from Egypt unto the great river Perath.</p>
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And Joseph was successful in all his ways, and the Lord was with him, and the Lord gave Joseph additional wisdom, and honor, and glory, and love toward him in the hearts of the Egyptians and throughout the land, and Joseph reigned over the whole country forty years.</p>
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And all the countries of the Philistines and Canaan and Zidon, and on the other side of Jordan, brought presents unto Joseph all his days, and the whole country was in the hand of Joseph, and they brought unto him a yearly tribute as it was regulated, for Joseph had fought
                      against all his surrounding enemies and subdued them, and the whole country was in the hand of Joseph, and Joseph sat securely upon his throne in Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And also all his brethren the sons of Jacob dwelt securely in the land, all the days of Joseph, and they were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly in the land, and they served the Lord all their days, as their father Jacob had commanded them.</p>
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And it came to pass at the end of many days and years, when the children of Esau were dwelling quietly in their land with Bela their king, that the children of Esau were fruitful and multiplied in the land, and they resolved to go and fight with the sons of Jacob and all Egypt, and to deliver their brother Zepho, the son of Eliphaz, and his men, for they were yet in those days slaves to Joseph.</p>
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And the children of Esau sent unto all the children of the east, and they made peace with them, and all the children of the east came unto them to go with the children of Esau to Egypt to battle.</p>
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And there came also unto them of the people of Angeas, king of Dinhabah, and they also sent unto the children of Ishmael and they also came unto them.</p>
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And all this people assembled and came unto Seir to assist the children of Esau in their battle, and this camp was very large and heavy with people, numerous as the sand of the sea, about eight hundred thousand men, infantry and cavalry, and all these troops went down
                      to Egypt to fight with the sons of Jacob, and they encamped by Rameses.</p>
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And Joseph went forth with his brethren with the mighty men of Egypt, about six hundred men, and they fought with them in the land of Rameses; and the sons of Jacob at that time again fought with the children of Esau, in the fiftieth year of the sons of Jacob going down to Egypt, that is the thirtieth year of the reign of Bela over the children of Esau in Seir.</p>
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And the Lord gave all the mighty men of Esau and the children of the east into the hand of Joseph and his brethren, and the people of the children of Esau and the children of the east were smitten before Joseph.</p>
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And of the people of Esau and the children of the east that were slain, there fell before the sons of Jacob about two hundred thousand men, and their king Bela the son of Beor fell with them in the battle, and when the children of Esau saw that their king had fallen in battle and was dead, their hands became weak in the combat.</p>
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And Joseph and his brethren and all Egypt were still smiting the people of the house of Esau, and all Esau's people were afraid of the sons of Jacob and fled from before them.</p>
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And Joseph and his brethren and all Egypt pursued them a day's journey, and they slew yet from them about three hundred men, continuing to smite them in the road; and they afterward turned back from them.</p>
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And Joseph and all his brethren returned to Egypt, not one man was missing from them, but of the Egyptians there fell twelve men.</p>
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And when Joseph returned to Egypt he ordered Zepho and his men to be additionally bound, and they bound them in irons and they increased their grief.</p>
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And all the people of the children of Esau, and the children of the east, returned in shame each unto his city, for all the mighty men that were with them had fallen in battle.</p>
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And when the children of Esau saw that their king had died in battle they hastened and took a man from the people of the children of the east; his name was Jobab the son of Zarach, from the land of Botzrah, and they caused him to reign over them instead of Bela
                      their king.</p>
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And Jobab sat upon the throne of Bela as king in his stead, and Jobab reigned in Edom over all the children of Esau ten years, and the children of Esau went no more to fight with the sons of Jacob from that day forward, for the sons of Esau knew the valor of the sons of
                      Jacob, and they were greatly afraid of them.</p>
                      <p><sup>28</sup> But from that day forward the children of Esau hated the sons of Jacob, and the hatred and enmity were very strong between them all the days, unto this day.</p>         
                      <p><sup>29</sup> And it came to pass after this, at the end of ten years, Jobab, the son of Zarach, from Botzrah, died, and the children of Esau took a man whose name was Chusham, from the land of Teman, and they made him king over them instead of Jobab, and Chusham reigned in Edom over all the children of Esau for twenty years.</p>
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And Joseph, king of Egypt, and his brethren, and all the children of Israel dwelt securely in Egypt in those days, together with all the children of Joseph and his brethren, having no hindrance or evil accident and the land of Egypt was at that time at rest from war in the days of Joseph and his brethren.</p>
