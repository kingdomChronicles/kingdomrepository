        <H2>Chapter 1</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> The Lord appears to Moses and commands him to go down to Egypt to Deliver Israel. Aaron meets him. Israel on hearing of his Mission greatly rejoices. Moses and Aaron go to Pharaoh, who calls all the Magicians to meet Moses. They Perform Miracles as well as Moses, and thus Deceive the King. Pharaoh, not finding the Name of Jehovah on any of the Books of Records, says he does not know who He is, and will not let his People go. Moses and Aaron teach Pharaoh, but he will not hearken, but causes the labor of the Children of Israel to be increased. Moses being discouraged is told by the Lord that with an outstretched hand and heavy Plagues, Israel shall be Delivered.</p>



                      <p><sup>1</sup> And in those days Moses was feeding the flock of Reuel the Midianite his father-in-law, beyond the wilderness of Sin, and the stick which he took from his father-in-law was in his hand.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And it came to pass one day that a kid of goats strayed from the flock, and Moses pursued it and it came to the mountain of God to Horeb.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And when he came to Horeb, the Lord appeared there unto him in the bush, and he found the bush burning with fire, but the fire had no power over the bush to consume it.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And Moses was greatly astonished at this sight, wherefore the bush was not consumed, and he approached to see this mighty thing, and the Lord called unto Moses out of the fire and commanded him to go down to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to send the children of Israel from his service.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And the Lord said unto Moses, Go, return to Egypt, for all those men who sought thy life are dead, and thou shalt speak unto Pharaoh to send forth the children of Israel from his land.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And the Lord showed him to do signs and wonders in Egypt before the eyes of Pharaoh and the eyes of his subjects, in order that they might believe that the Lord had sent him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And Moses hearkened to all that the Lord had commanded him, and he returned to his father-in-law and told him the thing, and Reuel said to him, Go in peace.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And Moses rose up to go to Egypt, and he took his wife and sons with him, and he was at an inn in the road, and an angel of God came down, and sought an occasion against him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And he wished to kill him on account of his first born son, because he had not circumcised him, and had transgressed the covenant which the Lord had made with Abraham.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> For Moses had hearkened to the words of his father-in-law which he had spoken to him, not to circumcise his first born son, therefore he circumcised him not.</p>                    
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And Zipporah saw the angel of the Lord seeking an occasion against Moses, and she knew that this thing was owing to his not having circumcised her son Gershom.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And Zipporah hastened and took of the sharp rock stones that were there, and she circumcised her son, and delivered her husband and her son from the hand of the angel of the Lord.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And Aaron the son of Amram, the brother of Moses, was in Egypt walking at the river side on that day.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And the Lord appeared to him in that place, and he said to him, Go now toward Moses in the wilderness, and he went and met him in the mountain of God, and he kissed him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And Aaron lifted up his eyes, and saw Zipporah the wife of Moses and her children, and he said unto Moses, Who are these unto thee?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And Moses said unto him, They are my wife and sons, which God gave to me in Midian; and the thing grieved Aaron on account of the woman and her children.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And Aaron said to Moses, Send away the woman and her children that they may go to her father's house, and Moses hearkened to the words of Aaron, and did so.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And Zipporah returned with her children, and they went to the house of Reuel, and remained there until the time arrived when the Lord had visited his people, and brought them forth from Egypt from the hand at Pharaoh.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And Moses and Aaron came to Egypt to the community of the children of Israel, and they spoke to them all the words of the Lord, and the people rejoiced an exceeding great rejoicing.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And Moses and Aaron rose up early on the next day, and they went to the house of Pharaoh, and they took in their hands the stick of God.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And when they came to the king's gate, two young lions were confined there with iron instruments, and no person went out or came in from before them, unless those whom the king ordered to come, when the conjurors came and withdrew the lions by their incantations, and this brought them to the king.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And Moses hastened and lifted up the stick upon the lions, and he loosed them, and Moses and Aaron came into the king's house.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>23</sup> The lions also came with them in joy, and they followed them and rejoiced as a dog rejoices over his master when he comes from the field.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And when Pharaoh saw this thing he was astonished at it, and he was greatly terrified at the report, for their appearance was like the appearance of the children of God.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And Pharaoh said to Moses, What do you require? and they answered him, saying, The Lord God of the Hebrews has sent us to thee, to say, Send forth my people that they may serve me.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And when Pharaoh heard their words he was greatly terrified before them, and he said to them, Go today and come back to me  tomorrow, and they did according to the word of the king.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And when they had gone Pharaoh sent for Balaam the magician and to Jannes and Jambres his sons, and to all the magicians and conjurors and counsellors which belonged to the king, and they all came and sat before the king.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And the king told them all the words which Moses and his brother Aaron had spoken to him, and the magicians said to the king, But how came the men to thee, on account of the lions which were confined at the gate?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>29</sup> And the king said, Because they lifted up their rod against the lions and loosed them, and came to me, and the lions also rejoiced at them as a dog rejoices to meet his master.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And Balaam the son of Beor the magician answered the king, saying, These are none else than magicians like ourselves.</p>
                      <p><sup>31</sup> Now therefore send for them, and let them come and we will try them, and the king did so.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And in the morning Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron to come before the king, and they took the rod of God, and came to the king and spoke to him, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>33</sup> Thus said the Lord God of the Hebrews, Send my people that they may serve me.</p>                    
                      <p><sup>34</sup> And the king said to them, But who will believe you that you are the messengers of God and that you come to me by his order?</p>
                      <p><sup>35</sup> Now therefore give a wonder or sign in this matter, and then the words which you speak will be believed.</p> 
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And Aaron hastened and threw the rod out of his hand before Pharaoh and before his servants, and the rod turned into a serpent.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>37</sup> And the sorcerers saw this and they cast each man his rod upon the ground and they became serpents.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And the serpent of Aaron's rod lifted up its head and opened its mouth to swallow the rods of the magicians.</p> 
                      <p><sup>39</sup> And Balaam the magician answered and said, This thing has been from the days of old, that a serpent should swallow its fellow, and that living things devour each other.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>40</sup> Now therefore restore it to a rod as it was at first, and we will also restore our rods as they were at first, and if thy rod shall swallow our rods, then shall we know that the spirit of God is in thee, and if not, thou art only an artificer like unto ourselves.</p>
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And Aaron hastened and stretched forth his hand and caught hold of the serpent's tail and it became a rod in his hand, and the sorcerers did the like with their rods, and they got hold, each man of the tail of his serpent, and they became rods as at first.</p> 
                      <p><sup>42</sup> And when they were restored to rods, the rod of Aaron swallowed up their rods.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>43</sup> And when the king saw this thing, he ordered the book of records that related to the kings of Egypt, to be brought, and they brought the book of records, the chronicles of the kings of Egypt, in which all the idols of Egypt were inscribed, for they thought of finding therein the name of Jehovah, but they found it not.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>44</sup> And Pharaoh said to Moses and Aaron, Behold I have not found the name of your God written in this book, and his name I know not.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>45</sup> And the counsellors and wise men answered the king, We have heard that the God of the Hebrews is a son of the wise, the son of ancient kings.</p>                    
                      <p><sup>46</sup> And Pharaoh turned to Moses and Aaron and said to them, I know not the Lord whom you have declared, neither will I send his people.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>47</sup> And they answered and said to the king, The Lord God of Gods is his name, and he proclaimed his name over us from the days of our ancestors, and sent us, saying, Go to Pharaoh and say unto him, Send my people that they may serve me.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>48</sup> Now therefore send us, that we may take a journey for three days in the wilderness, and there may sacrifice to him, for from the days of our going down to Egypt, he has not taken from our hands either burnt offering, oblation or sacrifice, and if thou wilt not send us, his
                      anger will be kindled against thee, and he will smite Egypt either with the plague or with the sword.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>49</sup> And Pharaoh said to them, Tell me now his power and his might; and they said to him, He created the heaven and the earth, the seas and all their fishes, he formed the light, created the darkness, caused rain upon the earth and watered it, and made the herbage and grass to
                      sprout, he created man and beast and the animals of the forest, the birds of the air and the fish of the sea, and by his mouth they live and die.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>50</sup> Surely he created thee in thy mother's womb, and put into thee the breath of life, and reared thee and placed thee upon the royal throne of Egypt, and he will take thy breath and soul from thee, and return thee to the ground whence thou wast taken.</p> 
                      <p><sup>51</sup> And the anger of the king was kindled at their words, and he said to them, But who amongst all the Gods of nations can do this? my river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>52</sup> And he drove them from him, and he ordered the labor upon Israel to be more severe than it was yesterday and before.</p>
                      <p><sup>53</sup> And Moses and Aaron went out from the king's presence, and they saw the children of Israel in an evil condition for the task-masters had made their labor exceedingly heavy.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>54</sup> And Moses returned to the Lord and said, Why hast thou ill treated thy people? for since I came to speak to Pharaoh what thou didst send me for, he has exceedingly ill used the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>55</sup> And the Lord said to Moses, Behold thou wilt see that with an outstretched hand and heavy plagues, Pharaoh will send the children of Israel from his land.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>56</sup> And Moses and Aaron dwelt amongst their brethren the children of Israel in Egypt.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>57</sup> And as for the children of Israel the Egyptians embittered their lives, with the heavy work which they imposed upon them.</p>
                      

                   
        <H2>Chapter 2</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> After Two Years, Moses and Aaron again go to Pharaoh, but Pharaoh will not Hearken. The Lord afflicts Egypt with all manner of Plagues and Afflictions. The First-born of all the Egyptians is Slain. Pharaoh sends the Children of Israel away, and all the Egyptians rise up to urge their Departure, but they will not go in the Night.</p>

                         
                    
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And at the end of two years, the Lord again sent Moses to Pharaoh to bring forth the children of Israel, and to send them out of the land of Egypt.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And Moses went and came to the house of Pharaoh, and he spoke to him the words of the Lord who had sent him, but Pharaoh would not hearken to the voice of the Lord, and God roused his might in Egypt upon Pharaoh and his subjects, and God smote Pharaoh and his people with very great and sore plagues.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And the Lord sent by the hand of Aaron and turned all the waters of Egypt into blood, with all their streams and rivers.</p>
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And when an Egyptian came to drink and draw water, he looked into his pitcher, and behold all the water was turned into blood; and when he came to drink from his cup the water in the cup became blood.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And when a woman kneaded her dough and cooked her victuals, their appearance was turned to that of blood.</p> 
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And the Lord sent again and caused all their waters to bring forth frogs, and all the frogs came into the houses of the Egyptians.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And when the Egyptians drank, their bellies were filled with frogs and they danced in their bellies as they dance when in the river.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And all their drinking water and cooking water turned to frogs, also when they lay in their beds their perspiration bred frogs.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> Notwithstanding all this the anger of the Lord did not turn from them, and his hand was stretched out against all the Egyptians to smite them with every heavy plague.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And he sent and smote their dust to lice, and the lice became in Egypt to the height of two cubits upon the earth.</p>
                      <p><sup>11</sup> The lice were also very numerous, in the flesh of man and beast, in all the inhabitants of Egypt, also upon the king and queen the Lord sent the lice, and it grieved Egypt exceedingly on account of the lice.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> Notwithstanding this, the anger of the Lord did not turn away, and his hand was still stretched out over Egypt.</p> 
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And the Lord sent all kinds of beasts of the field into Egypt, and they came and destroyed all Egypt, man and beast, and trees, and all things that were in Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And the Lord sent fiery serpents, scorpions, mice, weasels, toads, together with others creeping in dust.</p> 
                      <p><sup>15</sup> Flies, hornets, fleas, bugs and gnats, each swarm according to its kind.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And all reptiles and winged animals according to their kind came to Egypt and grieved the Egyptians exceedingly.</p>
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And the fleas and flies came into the eyes and ears of the Egyptians.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And the hornet came upon them and drove them away, and they removed from it into their inner rooms, and it pursued them.</p>
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And when the Egyptians hid themselves on account of the swarm of animals, they locked their doors after them, and God ordered the Sulanuth which was in the sea, to come up and go into Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And she had long arms, ten cubits in length of the cubit of a man.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And she went upon the roofs and uncovered the raftering and flooring and cut them, and stretched forth her arm into the house and removed the lock and the bolt, and opened the houses of Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>22</sup> Afterward came the swarm of animals into the houses of Egypt, and the swarm of animals destroyed the Egyptians, and it grieved them exceedingly.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>23</sup> Notwithstanding this the anger of the Lord did not turn away from the Egyptians, and his hand was yet stretched forth against them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And God sent the pestilence, and the pestilence pervaded Egypt, in the horses and asses, and in the camels, in herds of oxen and sheep and in man.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And when the Egyptians rose up early in the morning to take their cattle to pasture they found all their cattle dead.</p>
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And there remained of the cattle of the Egyptians only one in ten, and of the cattle belonging to Israel in Goshen not one died.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And God sent a burning inflammation in the flesh of the Egyptians, which burst their skins, and it became a severe itch in all the Egyptians from the soles of their feet to the crowns of their heads.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And many boils were in their flesh, that their flesh wasted away until they became rotten and putrid.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>29</sup> Notwithstanding this the anger of the Lord did not turn away, and his hand was still stretched out over all Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And the Lord sent a very heavy hail, which smote their vines and broke their fruit trees and dried them up that they fell upon them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>31</sup> Also every green herb became dry and perished, for a mingling fire descended amidst the hail, therefore the hail and the fire consumed all things.</p>          
                      <p><sup>32</sup> Also men and beasts that were found abroad perished of the flames of fire and of the hail, and all the young lions were exhausted.</p>                    
                      <p><sup>33</sup> And the Lord sent and brought numerous locusts into Egypt, the Chasel, Salom, Chargol, and Chagole, locusts each of its kind, which devoured all that the hail had left remaining.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>34</sup> Then the Egyptians rejoiced at the locusts, although they consumed the produce of the field, and they caught them in abundance and salted them for food.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And the Lord turned a mighty wind of the sea which took away all the locusts, even those that were salted, and thrust them into the Red Sea; not one locust remained within the boundaries of Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And God sent darkness upon Egypt, that the whole land of Egypt and Pathros became dark for three days, so that a man could not see his hand when he lifted it to his mouth.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>37</sup> At that time died many of the people of Israel who had rebelled against the Lord and who would not hearken to Moses and Aaron, and believed not in them that God had sent them.</p>
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And who had said, We will not go forth from Egypt lest we perish with hunger in a desolate wilderness, and who would not hearken to the voice of Moses.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>39</sup> And the Lord plagued them in the three days of darkness, and the Israelites buried them in those days, without the Egyptians knowing of them or rejoicing over them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>40</sup> And the darkness was very great in Egypt for three days, and any person who was standing when the darkness came, remained standing in his place, and he that was sitting remained sitting, and he that was lying continued lying in the same state, and he that was
                      walking remained sitting upon the ground in the same spot; and this thing happened to all the Egyptians, until the darkness had passed away.</p>
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And the days of darkness passed away, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron to the children of Israel, saying, Celebrate your feast and make your Passover, for behold I come in the midst of the night amongst all the Egyptians, and I will smite all their first born, from the
                      first born of a man to the first born of a beast, and when I see your Passover, I will pass over you.</p>
                      <p><sup>42</sup> And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, thus did they in that night.</p>
                      <p><sup>43</sup> And it came to pass in the middle of the night, that the Lord went forth in the midst of Egypt, and smote all the first born of the Egyptians, from the first born of man to the first born of beast.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>44</sup> And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry throughout Egypt in that night, for there was not a house in which there was not a corpse.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>45</sup> Also the likenesses of the first born of Egypt, which were carved in the walls at their houses, were destroyed and fell to the ground.</p>                  
                      <p><sup>46</sup> Even the bones of their first born who had died before this and whom they had buried in their houses, were raked up by the dogs of Egypt on that night and dragged before the Egyptians and cast before them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>47</sup> And all the Egyptians saw this evil which had suddenly come upon them, and all the Egyptians cried out with a loud voice.</p>
                      <p><sup>48</sup> And all the families of Egypt wept upon that night, each man for his son and each man for his daughter, being the first born, and the tumult of Egypt was heard at a distance on that night.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>49</sup> And Bathia the daughter of Pharaoh went forth with the king on that night to seek Moses and Aaron in their houses, and they found them in their houses, eating and drinking and rejoicing with all Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>50</sup> And Bathia said to Moses, Is this the reward for the good which I have done to thee, who have reared thee and stretched thee out, and thou hast brought this evil upon me and my father's house?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>51</sup> And Moses said to her, Surely ten plagues did the Lord bring upon Egypt; did any evil accrue to thee from any of them? did one of them affect thee? and she said, No.</p>                    
                      <p><sup>52</sup> And Moses said to her, Although thou art the first born to thy mother, thou shalt not die, and no evil shall reach thee in the midst of Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>53</sup> And she said, What advantage is it to me, when I see the king, my brother, and all his household and subjects in this evil, whose first born perish with all the first born of Egypt?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>54</sup> And Moses said to her, Surely thy brother and his household, and subjects, the families of Egypt, would not hearken to the words of the Lord, therefore did this evil come upon them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>55</sup> And Pharaoh king of Egypt approached Moses and Aaron, and some of the children of Israel who were with them in that place, and he prayed to them, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>56</sup> Rise up and take your brethren, all the children of Israel who are in the land, with their sheep and oxen, and all belonging to them, they shall leave nothing remaining, only pray for me to the Lord your God.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>57</sup> And Moses said to Pharaoh, Behold though thou art thy mother's first born, yet fear not, for thou wilt not die, for the Lord has commanded that thou shalt live, in order to show thee his great might and strong stretched out arm.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>58</sup> And Pharaoh ordered the children of Israel to be sent away, and all the Egyptians strengthened themselves to send them, for they said, We are all perishing.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>59</sup> And all the Egyptians sent the Israelites forth, with great riches, sheep and oxen and precious things, according to the oath of the Lord between him and our Father Abraham.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>60</sup> And the children of Israel delayed going forth at night, and when the Egyptians came to them to bring them out, they said to them, Are we thieves, that we should go forth at night?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>61</sup> And the children of Israel asked of the Egyptians, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and the children of Israel stripped the Egyptians.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>62</sup> And Moses hastened and rose up and went to the river of Egypt, and brought up from thence the coffin of Joseph and took it with him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>63</sup> The children of Israel also brought up, each man his father's coffin with him, and each man the coffins of his tribe.</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"> The Departure of the Israelites from Egypt with Great Riches and Flocks and Herds. After the Egyptians bury their First-born, many of them go after the Israelites to induce them to return. But they refuse to return, and fight the Nobles of Egypt and drive them home. Pharaoh resolves with the Egyptians to pursue Israel and compel them to Return. The Children of Israel are divided. some wanting to go back. Moses prays for deliverance. The Lord tells him not to cry to him, but proceed. The waters of the Red Sea are Divided. The Israelites pass Through in Safety, but the Egyptians are utterly Destroyed. The Israelites proceed on their Journey, and are fed with Manna. The Children of Esau fight Israel, but the Latter Prevail.</p>

                  
                          
                    
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides the little ones and their wives.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>2</sup> Also a mixed multitude went up with them, and flocks and herds, even much cattle.</p>                    
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in the land of Egypt in hard labor, was two hundred and ten years.</p>
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And at the end of two hundred and ten years, the Lord brought forth the children of Israel from Egypt with a strong hand.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And the children of Israel traveled from Egypt and from Goshen and from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth on the fifteenth day of the first month.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And the Egyptians buried all their first born whom the Lord had smitten, and all the Egyptians buried their slain for three days.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And the children of Israel traveled from Succoth and encamped in Ethom, at the end of the wilderness.</p> 
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And on the third day after the Egyptians had buried their first born, many men rose up from Egypt and went after Israel to make them return to Egypt, for they repented that they had sent the Israelites away from their servitude.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And one man said to his neighbor, Surely Moses and Aaron spoke to Pharaoh, saying, We will go a three days' journey in the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God.</p>                   
                      <p><sup>10</sup> Now therefore let us rise up early in the morning and cause them to return, and it shall be that if they return with us to Egypt to their masters, then shall we know that there is faith in them, but if they will not return, then will we fight with them, and make them come back with great power and a strong hand.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And all the nobles of Pharaoh rose up in the morning, and with them about seven hundred thousand men, and they went forth from Egypt on that day, and came to the place where the children of Israel were.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And all the Egyptians saw and behold Moses and Aaron and all the children of Israel were sitting before Pi-hahiroth, eating and drinking and celebrating the feast of the Lord.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And all the Egyptians said to the children of Israel, Surely you said, We will go a journey for three days in the wilderness and sacrifice to our God and return.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>14</sup> Now therefore this day makes five days since you went, why do you not return to your masters?</p> 
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And Moses and Aaron answered them, saying, Because the Lord our God has testified in us, saying, You shall no more return to Egypt, but we will betake ourselves to a land flowing with milk and honey, as the Lord our God had sworn to our ancestors to give to us.</p>
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And when the nobles of Egypt saw that the children of Israel did not hearken to them, to return to Egypt, they girded themselves to fight with Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And the Lord strengthened the hearts of the children of Israel over the Egyptians, that they gave them a severe beating, and the battle was sore upon the Egyptians, and all the Egyptians fled from before the children of Israel, for many of them perished by the hand of
                      Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And the nobles of Pharaoh went to Egypt and told Pharaoh, saying, The children of Israel have fled, and will no more return to Egypt, and in this manner did Moses and Aaron speak to us.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And Pharaoh heard this thing, and his heart and the hearts of all his subjects were turned against Israel, and they repented that they had sent Israel; and all the Egyptians advised Pharaoh to pursue the children of Israel to make them come back to their burdens.</p>
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And they said each man to his brother, What is this which we have done, that we have sent Israel from our servitude?</p>
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And the Lord strengthened the hearts of all the Egyptians to pursue the Israelites, for the Lord desired to overthrow the Egyptians in the Red Sea.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And Pharaoh rose up and harnessed his chariot, and he ordered all the Egyptians to assemble, not one man was left excepting the little ones and the women.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And all the Egyptians went forth with Pharaoh to pursue the children of Israel, and the camp of Egypt was an exceedingly large and heavy camp, about ten hundred thousand men.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And the whole of this camp went and pursued the children of Israel to bring them back to Egypt, and they reached them encamping by the Red Sea.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and beheld all the Egyptians pursuing them, and the children of Israel were greatly terrified at them, and the children of Israel cried to the Lord.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And on account of the Egyptians, the children of Israel divided themselves into four divisions, and they were divided in their opinions, for they were afraid of the Egyptians, and Moses spoke to each of them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>27</sup> The first division was of the children of Reuben, Simeon, and Issachar, and they resolved to cast themselves into the sea, for they were exceedingly afraid of the Egyptians.</p>                    
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And Moses said to them, Fear not, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which He will effect this day for you.</p>
                      <p><sup>29</sup> The second division was of the children of Zebulun, Benjamin and Naphtali, and they resolved to go back to Egypt with the Egyptians.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And Moses said to them, Fear not, for as you have seen the Egyptians this day, so shall you see them no more for ever.</p>
                      <p><sup>31</sup> The third division was of the children of Judah and Joseph, and they resolved to go to meet the Egyptians to fight with them.</p>
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And Moses said to them, Stand in your places, for the Lord will fight for you, and you shall remain silent.</p>
                      <p><sup>33</sup> And the fourth division was of the children of Levi, Gad, and Asher, and they resolved to go into the midst of the Egyptians to confound them, and Moses said to them, Remain in your stations and fear not, only call unto the Lord that he may save you out of their hands.</p>
                      <p><sup>34</sup> After this Moses rose up from amidst the people, and he prayed to the Lord and said,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>35</sup> O Lord God of the whole earth, save now thy people whom thou didst bring forth from Egypt, and let not the Egyptians boast that power and might are theirs.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>36</sup> So the Lord said to Moses, Why dost thou cry unto me? speak to the children of Israel that they shall proceed, and do thou stretch out thy rod upon the sea and divide it, and the children of Israel shall pass through it.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>37</sup> And Moses did so, and he lifted up his rod upon the sea and divided it.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And the waters of the sea were divided into twelve parts, and the children of Israel passed through on foot, with shoes, as a man would pass through a prepared road.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>39</sup> And the Lord manifested to the children of Israel his wonders in Egypt and in the sea by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>
                      <p><sup>40</sup> And when the children of Israel had entered the sea, the Egyptians came after them, and the waters of the sea resumed upon them, and they all sank in the water, and not one man was left excepting Pharaoh, who gave thanks to the Lord and believed in him, therefore the Lord did not cause him to perish at that time with the Egyptians.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And the Lord ordered an angel to take him from amongst the Egyptians, who cast him upon the land of Ninevah and he reigned over it for a long time.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>42</sup> And on that day the Lord saved Israel from the hand of Egypt, and all the children of Israel saw that the Egyptians had perished, and they beheld the great hand of the Lord, in what he had performed in Egypt and in the sea.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>43</sup> Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, on the day when the Lord caused the Egyptians to fall before them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>44</sup> And all Israel sang in concert, saying, I will sing to the Lord for He is greatly exalted, the horse and his rider has he cast into the sea; behold it is written in the book of the law of God.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>45</sup> After this the children of Israel proceeded on their journey, and encamped in Marah, and the Lord gave to the children of Israel statutes and judgments in that place in Marah, and the Lord commanded the children of Israel to walk in all his ways and to serve him.</p>
                      <p><sup>46</sup> And they journeyed from Marah and came to Elim, and in Elim were twelve springs of water and seventy date trees, and the children encamped there by the waters.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>47</sup> And they journeyed from Elim and came to the wilderness of Sin, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>48</sup> At that time the Lord gave the manna to the children of Israel to eat, and the Lord caused food to rain from heaven for the children of Israel day by day.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>49</sup> And the children of Israel ate the manna for forty years, all the days that they were in the wilderness, until they came to the land of Canaan to possess it.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>50</sup> And they proceeded from the wilderness of Sin and encamped in Alush.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>51</sup> And they proceeded from Alush and encamped in Rephidim.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>52</sup> And when the children of Israel were in Rephidim, Amalek the son of Eliphaz, the son of Esau, the brother of Zepho, came to fight with Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>53</sup> And he brought with him eight hundred and one thousand men, magicians and conjurers, and he prepared for battle with Israel in Rephidim.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>54</sup> And they carried on a great and severe battle against Israel, and the Lord delivered Amalek and his people into the hands of Moses and the children of Israel, and into the hand of Joshua, the son of Nun, the Ephrathite, the servant of Moses.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>55</sup> And the children of Israel smote Amalek and his people at the edge of the sword, but the battle was very sore upon the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>56</sup> And the Lord said to Moses, Write this thing as a memorial for thee in a book, and place it in the hand of Joshua, the son of Nun, thy servant, and thou shalt command the children of Israel, saying, When thou shalt come to the land of Canaan, thou shalt utterly efface the
                      remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>57</sup> And Moses did so, and he took the book and wrote upon it these words, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>58</sup> Remember what Amalek has done to thee in the road when thou wentest forth from Egypt.</p>                        
                      <p><sup>59</sup> Who met thee in the road and smote thy rear, even those that were feeble behind thee when thou wast faint and weary.</p>
                      <p><sup>60</sup> Therefore it shall be when the Lord thy God shall have given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven, thou shalt not forget it.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>61</sup> And the king who shall have pity on Amalek, or upon his memory or upon his seed, behold I will require it of him, and I will cut him off from amongst his people.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>62</sup> And Moses wrote all these things in a book, and he enjoined the children of Israel respecting all these matters.</p>
