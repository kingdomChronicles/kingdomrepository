        <H2>Chapter 1</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> The Elders of Egypt conspire with Pharaoh and cunningly bring Israel into Bondage to them. Being afraid of their power, they afflict them in order to lessen the Number of the Children of Israel.</p>

                                          
                    
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that all the counsellors of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and all the elders of Egypt assembled and came before the king and bowed down to the ground, and they sat before him.</p>
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And the counsellors and elders of Egypt spoke unto the king, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> Behold the people of the children of Israel is greater and mightier than we are, and thou knowest all the evil which they did to us in the road when we returned from battle.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And thou hast also seen their strong power, for this power is unto them from their fathers, for but a few men stood up against a people numerous as the sand, and smote them at the edge of the sword, and of themselves not one has fallen, so that if they had been numerous
                      they would then have utterly destroyed them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> Now therefore give us counsel what to do with them, until we gradually destroy them from amongst us, lest they become too numerous for us in the land.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>6</sup> For if the children of Israel should increase in the land, they will become an obstacle to us, and if any war should happen to take place, they with their great strength will join our enemy against us, and fight against us, destroy us from the land and go away from it.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> So the king answered the elders of Egypt and said unto them, This is the plan advised against Israel, from which we will not depart,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>8</sup> Behold in the land are Pithom and Rameses, cities unfortified against battle, it behooves you and us to build them, and to  fortify them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> Now therefore go you also and act cunningly toward them, and proclaim a voice in Egypt and in Goshen at the command of the king, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> All ye men of Egypt, Goshen, Pathros and all their inhabitants! the king has commanded us to build Pithom and Rameses, and to fortify them for battle; who amongst you of all Egypt, of the children of Israel and of all the inhabitants of the cities, are willing to build with us, shall each have his wages given to him daily at the king's order; so go you first and do cunningly, and gather yourselves and come to Pithom and Rameses to build.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And whilst you are building, cause a proclamation of this kind to be made throughout Egypt every day at the command of the king.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And when some of the children of Israel shall come to build with you, you shall give them their wages daily for a few days.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And after they shall have built with you for their daily hire, drag yourselves away from them daily one by one in secret, and then you shall rise up and become their task-masters and officers, and you shall leave them afterward to build without wages, and should they refuse, then force them with all your might to build.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And if you do this it will be well with us to strengthen our land against the children of Israel, for on account of the fatigue of the building and the work, the children of Israel will decrease, because you will deprive them from their wives day by day.</p>
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And all the elders of Egypt heard the counsel of the king, and the counsel seemed good in their eyes and in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all Egypt, and they did according to the word of the king.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And all the servants went away from the king, and they caused a proclamation to be made in all Egypt, in Tachpanches and in Goshen, and in all the cities which surrounded Egypt, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>17</sup> You have seen what the children of Esau and Ishmael did to us, who came to war against us and wished to destroy us.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>18</sup> Now therefore the king commanded us to fortify the land, to build the cities Pithom and Rameses, and to fortify them for battle, if they should again come against us.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>19</sup> Whosoever of you from all Egypt and from the children of Israel will come to build with us, he shall have his daily wages given by the king, as his command is unto us.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And when Egypt and all the children of Israel heard all that the servants of Pharaoh had spoken, there came from the Egyptians, and the children of Israel to build with the servants of Pharaoh, Pithom and Rameses, but none of the children of Levi came with their brethren to
                      build.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And all the servants of Pharaoh and his princes came at first with deceit to build with all Israel as daily hired laborers, and they gave to Israel their daily hire at the beginning.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And the servants of Pharaoh built with all Israel, and were employed in that work with Israel for a month.</p> 
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And at the end of the month, all the servants of Pharaoh began to withdraw secretly from the people of Israel daily.</p>
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And Israel went on with the work at that time, but they then received their daily hire, because some of the men of Egypt were yet carrying on the work with Israel at that time; therefore the Egyptians gave Israel their hire in those days, in order that they, the Egyptians
                      their fellow-workmen, might also take the pay for their labor.</p>
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And at the end of a year and four months all the Egyptians had withdrawn from the children of Israel, so that the children of Israel were left alone engaged in the work.</p>
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And after all the Egyptians had withdrawn from the children of Israel they returned and became oppressors and officers over them, and some of them stood over the children of Israel as task masters, to receive from them all that they gave them for the pay of their labor.</p>                        
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And the Egyptians did in this manner to the children of Israel day by day, in order to afflict in their work.</p>
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And all the children of Israel were alone engaged in the labor, and the Egyptians refrained from giving any pay to the children of Israel from that time forward.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>29</sup> And when some of the men of Israel refused to work on account of the wages not being given to them, then the exactors and the servants of Pharaoh oppressed them and smote them with heavy blows, and made them return by force, to labor with their brethren; thus did all the Egyptians unto the children of Israel all the days.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And all the children of Israel were greatly afraid of the Egyptians in this matter, and all the children of Israel returned and worked alone without pay.</p>
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And the children of Israel built Pithom and Rameses, and all the children of Israel did the work, some making bricks, and some building, and the children of Israel built and fortified all the land of Egypt and its walls, and the children of Israel were engaged in work for many years, until the time came when the Lord remembered them and brought them out of Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>32</sup> But the children of Levi were not employed in the work with their brethren of Israel, from the beginning unto the day of their going forth from Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>33</sup> For all the children of Levi knew that the Egyptians had spoken all these words with deceit to the Israelites, therefore the children of Levi refrained from approaching to the work with their brethren.</p>
                      <p><sup>34</sup> And the Egyptians did not direct their attention to make the children of Levi work afterward, since they had not been with their brethren at the beginning, therefore the Egyptians left them alone.</p>
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And the hands of the men of Egypt were directed with continued severity against the children of Israel in that work, and the Egyptians made the children of Israel work with rigor.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And the Egyptians embittered the lives of the children of Israel with hard work, in mortar and bricks, and also in all manner of work in the field.</p>
                      <p><sup>37</sup> And the children of Israel called Melol the king of Egypt "Meror, king of Egypt," because in his days the Egyptians had embittered their lives with all manner of work.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And all the work wherein the Egyptians made the children of Israel labor, they exacted with rigor, in order to afflict the children of Israel, but the more they afflicted them, the more they increased and grew, and the Egyptians were grieved because of the children of Israel.</p>
         
                    

        <H2>Chapter 2</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Pharaoh Decrees that every Male Child born in Israel shall be Killed, and still they increase.</p>


                    
                      <p><sup>1</sup> At that time died Hadad the son of Bedad king of Edom, and Samlah from Mesrekah, from the country of the children of the east, reigned in his place.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> In the thirteenth year of the reign of Pharaoh king of Egypt, which was the hundred and twenty-fifth year of the Israelites going down into Egypt, Samlah had reigned over Edom eighteen years.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And when he reigned, he drew forth his hosts to go and fight against Zepho the son of Eliphaz and the children of Chittim, because they had made war against Angeas king of Africa, and they destroyed his whole army.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> But he did not engage with him, for the children of Esau prevented him, saying, He was their brother, so Samlah listened to the voice of the children of Esau, and turned back with all his forces to the land of Edom, and did not proceed to fight against Zepho the son of Eliphaz.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And Pharaoh king of Egypt heard this thing, saying, Samlah king of Edom has resolved to fight the children of Chittim, and afterward he will come to fight against Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And when the Egyptians heard this matter, they increased the labor upon the children of Israel, lest the Israelites should do unto them as they did unto them in their war with the children of Esau in the days of Hadad.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> So the Egyptians said unto the children of Israel, Hasten and do your work, and finish your task, and strengthen the land, lest the children of Esau your brethren should come to fight against us, for on your account will they come against us.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And the children of Israel did the work of the men of Egypt day by day, and the Egyptians afflicted the children of Israel in order to lessen them in the land.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> But as the Egyptians increased the labor upon the children of Israel, so did the children of Israel increase and multiply, and all Egypt was filled with the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And in the hundred and twenty-fifth year of Israel's going down into Egypt, all the Egyptians saw that their counsel did not succeed against Israel, but that they increased and grew, and the land of Egypt and the land of Goshen were filled with the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>11</sup> So all the elders of Egypt and its wise men came before the king and bowed down to him and sat before him.</p> 
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And all the elders of Egypt and the wise men thereof said unto the king, May the king live forever; thou didst counsel us the counsel against the children of Israel, and we did unto them according to the word of the king.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>13</sup> But in proportion to the increase of the labor so do they increase and grow in the land, and behold the whole country is filled with them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>14</sup> Now therefore our lord and king, the eyes of all Egypt are upon thee to give them advice with thy wisdom, by which they may prevail over Israel to destroy them, or to diminish them from the land; and the king answered them saying, Give you counsel in this matter that we
                      may know what to do unto them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And an officer, one of the king's counsellors, whose name was Job, from Mesopotamia, in the land of Uz, answered the king, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> If it please the king, let him hear the counsel of his servant; and the king said unto him, Speak.</p>
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And Job spoke before the king, the princes, and before all the elders of Egypt, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>18</sup> Behold the counsel of the king which he advised formerly respecting the labor of the children of Israel is very good, and you must not remove from them that labor forever.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>19</sup> But this is the advice counselled by which you may lessen them, if it seems good to the king to afflict them.</p>
                      <p><sup>20</sup> Behold we have feared war for a long time, and we said, When Israel becomes fruitful in the land, they will drive us from the land if a war should take place.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>21</sup> If it please the king, let a royal decree go forth, and let it be written in the laws of Egypt which shall not be revoked, that every male child born to the Israelites, his blood shall be spilled upon the ground.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And by your doing this, when all the male children of Israel shall have died, the evil of their wars will cease; let the king do so and send for all the Hebrew midwives and order them in this matter to execute it; so the thing pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Job.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And the king sent for the Hebrew midwives to be called, of which the name of one was Shephrah, and the name of the other Puah.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And the midwives came before the king, and stood in his presence.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And the king said unto them, When you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools, if it be a son, then you shall kill him, but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>26</sup> But if you will not do this thing, then will I burn you up and all your houses with fire.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>27</sup> But the midwives feared God and did not hearken to the king of Egypt nor to his words, and when the Hebrew women brought forth to the midwife son or daughter, then did the midwife do all that was necessary to the child and let it live; thus did the midwives all the days.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And this thing was told to the king, and he sent and called for the midwives and he said to them, Why have you done this thing and have saved the children alive?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>29</sup> And the midwives answered and spoke together before the king, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>30</sup> Let not the king think that the Hebrew women are as the Egyptian women, for all the children of Israel are hale, and before the midwife comes to them they are delivered, and as for us thy handmaids, for many days no Hebrew woman has brought forth upon us, for all the Hebrew women are their own midwives, because they are hale.</p>
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And Pharaoh heard their words and believed them in this matter, and the midwives went away from the king, and God dealt well with them, and the people multiplied and waxed exceedingly.</p>
          


        <H2>Chapter 3</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Aaron is Born. On Account of Pharaoh's decree, many of the Sons of Israel live apart from their Wives. The King's counsellors devise another plan to lessen the number of Israel by drowning them. The Lord finds a means of preserving the Male Children.</p>

                 
                                             
                      <p><sup>1</sup> There was a man in the land of Egypt of the seed of Levi, whose name was Amram, the son of Kehath, the son of Levi, the son of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And this man went and took a wife, namely Jochebed the daughter of Levi his father's sister, and she was one hundred and  twenty-six years old, and he came unto her.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And the woman conceived and bare a daughter, and she called her name Miriam, because in those days the Egyptians had embittered the lives of the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name Aaron, for in the days of her conception, Pharaoh began to spill the blood of the male children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> In those days died Zepho the son of Eliphaz, son of Esau, king of Chittim, and Janeas reigned in his stead.</p>
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And the time that Zepho reigned over the children of Chittim was fifty years, and he died and was buried in the city of Nabna in the land of Chittim.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And Janeas, one of the mighty men of the children of Chittim, reigned after him and he reigned fifty years.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And it was after the death of the king of Chittim that Balaam the son of Beor fled from the land of Chittim, and he went and came to Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And Pharaoh received him with great honor, for he had heard of his wisdom, and he gave him presents and made him for a  counsellor, and aggrandized him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And Balaam dwelt in Egypt, in honor with all the nobles of the king, and the nobles exalted him, because they all coveted to learn his wisdom.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And in the hundred and thirtieth year of Israel's going down to Egypt, Pharaoh dreamed that he was sitting upon his kingly throne, and lifted up his eyes and saw an old man standing before him, and there were scales in the hands of the old man, such scales as are used by merchants.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And the old man took the scales and hung them before Pharaoh.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And the old man took all the elders of Egypt and all its nobles and great men, and he tied them together and put them in one scale.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And he took a milk kid and put it into the other scale, and the kid preponderated over all.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And Pharaoh was astonished at this dreadful vision, why the kid should preponderate over all, and Pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And Pharaoh rose up early in the morning and called all his servants and related to them the dream, and the men were greatly afraid.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And the king said to all his wise men, Interpret I pray you the dream which I dreamed, that I may know it.</p>
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And Balaam the son of Beor answered the king and said unto him, This means nothing else but a great evil that will spring up against Egypt in the latter days.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>19</sup> For a son will be born to Israel who will destroy all Egypt and its inhabitants, and bring forth the Israelites from Egypt with a mighty hand.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>20</sup> Now therefore, O king, take counsel upon this matter, that you may destroy the hope of the children of Israel and their expectation, before this evil arise against Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And the king said unto Balaam, And what shall we do unto Israel? surely after a certain manner did we at first counsel against them and could not prevail over them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>22</sup> Now therefore give you also advice against them by which we may prevail over them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And Balaam answered the king, saying, Send now and call thy two counsellors, and we will see what their advice is upon this matter and afterward thy servant will speak.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And the king sent and called his two counsellors Reuel the Midianite and Job the Uzite, and they came and sat before the king.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And the king said to them, Behold you have both heard the dream which I have dreamed, and the interpretation thereof; now therefore give counsel and know and see what is to be done to the children of Israel, whereby we may prevail over them, before their evil shall spring up against us.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And Reuel the Midianite answered the king and said, May the king live, may the king live forever.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>27</sup> If it seem good to the king, let him desist from the Hebrews and leave them, and let him not stretch forth his hand against them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>28</sup> For these are they whom the Lord chose in days of old, and took as the lot of his inheritance from amongst all the nations of the earth and the kings of the earth; and who is there that stretched his hand against them with impunity, of whom their God was not avenged?</p>
                      <p><sup>29</sup> Surely thou knowest that when Abraham went down to Egypt, Pharaoh, the former king of Egypt, saw Sarah his wife, and took her for a wife, because Abraham said, She is my sister, for he was afraid, lest the men of Egypt should slay him on account of his wife.</p>
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And when the king of Egypt had taken Sarah then God smote him and his household with heavy plagues, until he restored unto Abraham his wife Sarah, then was he healed.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And Abimelech the Gerarite, king of the Philistines, God punished on account of Sarah wife of Abraham, in stopping up every womb from man to beast.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>32</sup> When their God came to Abimelech in the dream of night and terrified him in order that he might restore to Abraham Sarah whom he had taken, and afterward all the people of Gerar were punished on account of Sarah, and Abraham prayed to his God for them, and he was entreated of him, and he healed them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>33</sup> And Abimelech feared all this evil that came upon him and his people, and he returned to Abraham his wife Sarah, and gave him with her many gifts.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>34</sup> He did so also to Isaac when he had driven him from Gerar, and God had done wonderful things to him, that all the water courses of Gerar were dried up, and their productive trees did not bring forth.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>35</sup> Until Abimelech of Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Pichol the captain of his host, went to him and they bent and bowed down before him to the ground.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And they requested of him to supplicate for them, and he prayed to the Lord for them, and the Lord was entreated of him and he healed them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>37</sup> Jacob also, the plain man, was delivered through his integrity from the hand of his brother Esau, and the hand of Laban the Syrian his mother's brother, who had sought his life; likewise from the hand of all the kings of Canaan who had come together against him and his
                      children to destroy them, and the Lord delivered them out of their hands, that they turned upon them and smote them, for who had ever stretched forth his hand against them with impunity?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>38</sup> Surely Pharaoh the former, thy father's father, raised Joseph the son of Jacob above all the princes of the land of Egypt, when he saw his wisdom, for through his wisdom he rescued all the inhabitants of the land from the famine.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>39</sup> After which he ordered Jacob and his children to come down to Egypt, in order that through their virtue, the land of Egypt and the land of Goshen might be delivered from the famine.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>40</sup> Now therefore if it seem good in thine eyes, cease from destroying the children of Israel, but if it be not thy will that they shall dwell in Egypt, send them forth from here, that they may go to the land of Canaan, the land where their ancestors sojourned.</p> 
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And when Pharaoh heard the words of Jethro he was very angry with him, so that he rose with shame from the king's presence, and went to Midian, his land, and took Joseph's stick with him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>42</sup> And the king said to Job the Uzite, What sayest thou Job, and what is thy advice respecting the Hebrews?</p>
                      <p><sup>43</sup> So Job said to the king, Behold all the inhabitants of the land are in thy power, let the king do as it seems good in his eyes.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>44</sup> And the king said unto Balaam, What dost thou say, Balaam, speak thy word that we may hear it.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>45</sup> And Balaam said to the king, Of all that the king has counselled against the Hebrews will they be delivered, and the king will not be able to prevail over them with any counsel.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>46</sup> For if thou thinkest to lessen them by the flaming fire, thou canst not prevail over them, for surely their God delivered Abraham their father from Ur of the Chaldeans; and if thou thinkest to destroy them with a sword, surely Isaac their father was delivered from it, and a ram was placed in his stead.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>47</sup> And if with hard and rigorous labor thou thinkest to lessen them, thou wilt not prevail even in this, for their father Jacob served Laban in all manner of hard work, and prospered.</p>
                      <p><sup>48</sup> Now therefore, O King, hear my words, for this is the counsel which is counselled against them, by which thou wilt prevail over them, and from which thou shouldst not depart.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>49</sup> If it please the king let him order all their children which shall be born from this day forward, to be thrown into the water, for by this canst thou wipe away their name, for none of them, nor of their fathers, were tried in this manner.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>50</sup> And the king heard the words of Balaam, and the thing pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Balaam.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>51</sup> And the king ordered a proclamation to be issued and a law to be made throughout the land of Egypt, saying, Every male child born to the Hebrews from this day forward shall be thrown into the water.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>52</sup> And Pharaoh called unto all his servants, saying, Go now and seek throughout the land of Goshen where the children of Israel are, and see that every son born to the Hebrews shall be cast into the river, but every daughter you shall let live.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>53</sup> And when the children of Israel heard this thing which Pharaoh had commanded, to cast their male children into the river, some of the people separated from their wives and others adhered to them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>54</sup> And from that day forward, when the time of delivery arrived to those women of Israel who had remained with their husbands, they went to the field to bring forth there, and they brought forth in the field, and left their children upon the field and returned home.</p>
                      <p><sup>55</sup> And the Lord who had sworn to their ancestors to multiply them, sent one of his ministering angels which are in heaven to wash each child in water, to anoint and swathe it and to put into its hands two smooth stones from one of which it sucked milk and from the other honey, and he caused its hair to grow to its knees, by which it might cover itself; to comfort it and to cleave to it, through his compassion for it.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>56</sup> And when God had compassion over them and had desired to multiply them upon the face of the land, he ordered his earth to receive them to be preserved therein till the time of their growing up, after which the earth opened its mouth and vomited them forth and they sprouted forth from the city like the herb of the earth, and the grass of the forest, and they returned each to his family and to his father's house, and they remained with them.</p>                 
                      <p><sup>57</sup> And the babes of the children of Israel were upon the earth like the herb of the field, through God's grace to them.</p>
                      <p><sup>58</sup> And when all the Egyptians saw this thing, they went forth, each to his field with his yoke of oxen and his ploughshare, and they ploughed it up as one ploughs the earth at seed time.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>59</sup> And when they ploughed they were unable to hurt the infants of the children of Israel, so the people increased and waxed  exceedingly.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>60</sup> And Pharaoh ordered his officers daily to go to Goshen to seek for the babes of the children of Israel.</p>
                      <p><sup>61</sup> And when they had sought and found one, they took it from its mother's bosom by force, and threw it into the river, but the female child they left with its mother; thus did the Egyptians do to the Israelites all the days.</p>

                      <p><sup>1</sup> And it was at that time the spirit of God was upon Miriam the daughter of Amram the sister of Aaron, and she went forth and prophesied about the house, saying, Behold a son will be born unto us from my father and mother this time, and he will save Israel from the hands of Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And when Amram heard the words of his daughter, he went and took his wife back to the house, after he had driven her away at the time when Pharaoh ordered every male child of the house of Jacob to be thrown into the water.</p>

                      <p><sup>14</sup> And his sister Miriam stood afar off to know what would be done to him, and what would become of her words.</p> 
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And God sent forth at that time a terrible heat in the land of Egypt, which burned up the flesh of man like the sun in his circuit, and it greatly oppressed the Egyptians.</p>

                      <p><sup>1</sup> And the king of Edom died in those days, in the eighteenth year of his reign, and was buried in his temple which he had built for himself as his royal residence in the land of Edom.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And the children of Esau sent to Pethor, which is upon the river, and they fetched from there a young man of beautiful eyes and comely aspect, whose name was Saul, and they made him king over them in the place of Samlah.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And Saul reigned over all the children of Esau in the land of Edom for forty years.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And when Pharaoh king of Egypt saw that the counsel which Balaam had advised respecting the children of Israel did not succeed, but that still they were fruitful, multiplied and increased throughout the land of Egypt,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> Then Pharaoh commanded in those days that a proclamation should be issued throughout Egypt to the children of Israel, saying, No man shall diminish any thing of his daily labor.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And the man who shall be found deficient in his labor which he performs daily, whether in mortar or in bricks, then his youngest son shall be put in their place.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And the labor of Egypt strengthened upon the children of Israel in those days, and behold if one brick was deficient in any man's daily labor, the Egyptians took his youngest boy by force from his mother, and put him into the building in the place of the brick which his father had left wanting.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And the men of Egypt did so to all the children of Israel day by day, all the days for a long period.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> But the tribe of Levi did not at that time work with the Israelites their brethren, from the beginning, for the children of Levi knew the cunning of the Egyptians which they exercised at first toward the Israelites.</p>
   


        <H2>Chapter 6</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Moses puts the King's crown upon his own head. Baalam and the Wise Men make this a Pretext against him. When grown up, Moses visits his Brethren, and learns of their Grievances. Moses obtains a day's rest on the Sabbath for all Israel.</p>  


                                     
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And in the third year from the birth of Moses, Pharaoh was sitting at a banquet, when Alparanith the queen was sitting at his right and Bathia at his left, and the lad Moses was lying upon her bosom, and Balaam the son of Beor with his two sons, and all the princes of
                      the kingdom were sitting at table in the king's presence.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And the lad stretched forth his hand upon the king's head, and took the crown from the king's head and placed it on his own head.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And when the king and princes saw the work which the boy had done, the king and princes were terrified, and one man to his neighbor expressed astonishment.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And the king said unto the princes who were before him at table, What speak you and what say you, O ye princes, in this matter, and what is to be the judgment against the boy on account of this act?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And Balaam the son of Beor the magician answered before the king and princes, and he said, Remember now, O my lord and king, the dream which thou didst dream many days since, and that which thy servant interpreted unto thee.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>6</sup> Now therefore this is a child from the Hebrew children, in whom is the spirit of God, and let not my lord the king imagine that this youngster did this thing without knowledge.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> For he is a Hebrew boy, and wisdom and understanding are with him, although he is yet a child, and with wisdom has he done this and chosen unto himself the kingdom of Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>8</sup> For this is the manner of all the Hebrews to deceive kings and their nobles, to do all these things cunningly, in order to make the kings of the earth and their men tremble.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> Surely thou knowest that Abraham their father acted thus, who deceived the army of Nimrod king of Babel, and Abimelech king of Gerar, and that he possessed himself of the land of the children of Heth and all the kingdoms of Canaan.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And that he descended into Egypt and said of Sarah his wife, she is my sister, in order to mislead Egypt and her king.</p>
                      <p><sup>11</sup> His son Isaac also did so when he went to Gerar and dwelt there, and his strength prevailed over the army of Abimelech king of the Philistines.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> He also thought of making the kingdom of the Philistines stumble, in saying that Rebecca his wife was his sister.</p>
                      <p><sup>13</sup> Jacob also dealt treacherously with his brother, and took from his hand his birthright and his blessing.</p> 
                      <p><sup>14</sup> He went then to Padan-aram to the house of Laban his mother's brother, and cunningly obtained from him his daughter, his cattle, and all belonging to him, and fled away and returned to the land of Canaan to his father.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>15</sup> His sons sold their brother Joseph, who went down into Egypt and became a slave, and was placed in the prison house for twelve years.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> Until the former Pharaoh dreamed dreams, and withdrew him from the prison house, and magnified him above all the princes in Egypt on account of his interpreting his dreams to him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And when God caused a famine throughout the land he sent for and brought his father and all his brothers, and the whole of his father's household, and supported them without price or reward, and bought the Egyptians for slaves.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>18</sup> Now therefore my lord king behold this child has risen up in their stead in Egypt, to do according to their deeds and to trifle with every king, prince and judge.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>19</sup> If it please the king, let us now spill his blood upon the ground, lest he grow up and take away the government from thy hand, and the hope of Egypt perish after he shall have reigned.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And Balaam said to the king, Let us moreover call for all the judges of Egypt and the wise men thereof, and let us know if the judgment of death is due to this boy as thou didst say, and then we will slay him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And Pharaoh sent and called for all the wise men of Egypt and they came before the king, and an angel of the Lord came amongst them, and he was like one of the wise men of Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And the king said to the wise men, Surely you have heard what this Hebrew boy who is in the house has done, and thus has Balaam judged in the matter.</p>                  
                      <p><sup>23</sup> Now judge you also and see what is due to the boy for the act he has committed.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And the angel, who seemed like one of the wise men of Pharaoh, answered and said as follows, before all the wise men of Egypt and before the king and the princes:</p>                  
                      <p><sup>25</sup> If it please the king let the king send for men who shall bring before him an onyx stone and a coal of fire, and place them before the child, and if the child shall stretch forth his hand and take the onyx stone, then shall we know that with wisdom has the youth done all that he has done, and we must slay him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>26</sup> But if he stretch forth his hand upon the coal, then shall we know that it was not with knowledge that he did this thing, and he shall live.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And the thing seemed good in the eyes of the king and the princes, so the king did according to the word of the angel of the Lord.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And the king ordered the onyx stone and coal to be brought and placed before Moses.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>29</sup> And they placed the boy before them, and the lad endeavored to stretch forth his hand to the onyx stone, but the angel of the Lord took his hand and placed it upon the coal, and the coal became extinguished in his hand, and he lifted it up and put it into his mouth, and burned part of his lips and part of his tongue, and he became heavy in mouth and tongue.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And when the king and princes saw this, they knew that Moses had not acted with wisdom in taking off the crown from the king's head.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>31</sup> So the king and princes refrained from slaying the child, so Moses remained in Pharaoh's house, growing up, and the Lord was with him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And whilst the boy was in the king's house, he was robed in purple and he grew amongst the children of the king.</p>
                      <p><sup>33</sup> And when Moses grew up in the king's house, Bathia the daughter of Pharaoh considered him as a son, and all the household of Pharaoh honored him, and all the men of Egypt were afraid of him.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>34</sup> And he daily went forth and came into the land of Goshen, where his brethren the children of Israel were, and Moses saw them daily in shortness of breath and hard labor.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And Moses asked them, saying, Wherefore is this labor meted out unto you day by day?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And they told him all that had befallen them, and all the injunctions which Pharaoh had put upon them before his birth.</p>
                      <p><sup>37</sup> And they told him all the counsels which Balaam the son of Beor had counselled against them, and what he had also counselled against him in order to slay him when he had taken the king's crown from off his head.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And when Moses heard these things his anger was kindled against Balaam, and he sought to kill him, and he was in ambush for him day by day.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>39</sup> And Balaam was afraid of Moses, and he and his two sons rose up and went forth from Egypt, and they fled and delivered their souls and betook themselves to the land of Cush to Kikianus, king of Cush.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>40</sup> And Moses was in the king's house going out and coming in, the Lord gave him favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants, and in the eyes of all the people of Egypt, and they loved Moses exceedingly.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And the day arrived when Moses went to Goshen to see his brethren, that he saw the children of Israel in their burdens and hard labor, and Moses was grieved on their account.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>42</sup> And Moses returned to Egypt and came to the house of Pharaoh, and came before the king, and Moses bowed down before the king.</p>
                      <p><sup>43</sup> And Moses said unto Pharaoh, I pray thee my lord, I have come to seek a small request from thee, turn not away my face empty; and Pharaoh said unto him, Speak.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>44</sup> And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Let there be given unto thy servants the children of Israel who are in Goshen, one day to rest therein from their labor.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>45</sup> And the king answered Moses and said, Behold I have lifted up thy face in this thing to grant thy request.</p>
                      <p><sup>46</sup> And Pharaoh ordered a proclamation to be issued throughout Egypt and Goshen, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>47</sup> To you, all the children of Israel, thus says the king, for six days you shall do your work and labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest, and shall not preform any work, thus shall you do all the days, as the king and Moses the son of Bathia have commanded.</p>
                      <p><sup>48</sup> And Moses rejoiced at this thing which the king had granted to him, and all the children of Israel did as Moses ordered them.</p>
                      <p><sup>49</sup> For this thing was from the Lord to the children of Israel, for the Lord had begun to remember the children of Israel to save them for the sake of their fathers.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>50</sup> And the Lord was with Moses and his fame went throughout Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>51</sup> And Moses became great in the eyes of all the Egyptians, and in the eyes of all the children of Israel, seeking good for his people Israel and speaking words of peace regarding them to the king.</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle">Moses slays an Egyptian and being Discovered flees from Egypt. Aaron Prophecies.</p>  



                      <p><sup>1</sup> And when Moses was eighteen years old, he desired to see his father and mother and he went to them to Goshen, and when Moses had come near Goshen, he came to the place where the children of Israel were engaged in work, and he observed their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian smiting one of his Hebrew brethren.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And when the man who was beaten saw Moses he ran to him for help, for the man Moses was greatly respected in the house of Pharaoh, and he said to him, My lord attend to me, this Egyptian came to my house in the night, bound me, and came to my wife in my presence, and
                      now he seeks to take my life away.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And when Moses heard this wicked thing, his anger was kindled against the Egyptian, and he turned this way and the other, and when he saw there was no man there he smote the Egyptian and hid him in the sand, and delivered the Hebrew from the hand of him that smote him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And the Hebrew went to his house, and Moses returned to his home, and went forth and came back to the king's house.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And when the man had returned home, he thought of repudiating his wife, for it was not right in the house of Jacob, for any man to come to his wife after she had been defiled.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And the woman went and told her brothers, and the woman's brothers sought to slay him, and he fled to his house and escaped.</p>
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And on the second day Moses went forth to his brethren, and saw, and behold two men were quarreling, and he said to the wicked one, Why dost thou smite thy neighbor?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And he answered him and said to him, Who has set thee for a prince and judge over us? dost thou think to slay me as thou didst slay the Egyptian? and Moses was afraid and he said, Surely the thing is known?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And Pharaoh heard of this affair, and he ordered Moses to be slain, so God sent his angel, and he appeared unto Pharaoh in the likeness of a captain of the guard.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And the angel of the Lord took the sword from the hand of the captain of the guard, and took his head off with it, for the likeness of the captain of the guard was turned into the likeness of Moses.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And the angel of the Lord took hold of the right hand of Moses, and brought him forth from Egypt, and placed him from without the borders of Egypt, a distance of forty days' journey.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And Aaron his brother alone remained in the land of Egypt, and he prophesied to the children of Israel, saying,</p>

                      <p><sup>15</sup> And the Lord thought to destroy them, were it not that the Lord remembered the covenant which he had made with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> In those days the hand of Pharaoh continued to be severe against the children of Israel, and he crushed and oppressed them until the time when God sent forth his word and took notice of them.</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"> Moses flees to Cush. At the Death of the king, he is chosen in his Stead. He Reigns Forty Years in Cush.</p>


                       
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And it was in those days that there was a great war between the children of Cush and the children of the east and Aram, and they rebelled against the king of Cush in whose hands they were.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> So Kikianus king of Cush went forth with all the children of Cush, a people numerous as the sand, and he went to fight against Aram and the children of the east, to bring them under subjection.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And when Kikianus went out, he left Balaam the magician, with his two sons, to guard the city, and the lowest sort of the people of the land.</p>                  
                      <p><sup>4</sup> So Kikianus went forth to Aram and the children of the east, and he fought against them and smote them, and they all fell down wounded before Kikianus and his people.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And he took many of them captives and he brought them under subjection as at first, and he encamped upon their land to take tribute from them as usual.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And Balaam the son of Beor, when the king of Cush had left him to guard the city and the poor of the city, he rose up and advised with the people of the land to rebel against king Kikianus, not to let him enter the city when he should come home.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And the people of the land hearkened to him, and they swore to him and made him king over them, and his two sons for captains of the army.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>8</sup> So they rose up and raised the walls of the city at the two corners, and they built an exceeding strong building.</p>
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And at the third corner they dug ditches without number, between the city and the river which surrounded the whole land of Cush, and they made the waters of the river burst forth there.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> At the fourth corner they collected numerous serpents by their incantations and enchantments, and they fortified the city and dwelt therein, and no one went out or in before them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And Kikianus fought against Aram and the children of the east and he subdued them as before, and they gave him their usual tribute, and he went and returned to his land.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And when Kikianus the king of Cush approached his city and all the captains of the forces with him, they lifted up their eyes and saw that the walls of the city were built up and greatly elevated, so the men were astonished at this.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And they said one to the other, It is because they saw that we were delayed, in battle, and were greatly afraid of us, therefore have they done this thing and raised the city walls and fortified them so that the kings of Canaan might not come in battle against them.</p>
                      <p><sup>14</sup> So the king and the troops approached the city door and they looked up and behold, all the gates of the city were closed, and they called out to the sentinels, saying, Open unto us, that we may enter the city.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>15</sup> But the sentinels refused to open to them by the order of Balaam the ma/gician, their king, they suffered them not to enter their city.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> So they raised a battle with them opposite the city gate, and one hundred and thirty men of the army at Kikianus fell on that day.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And on the next day they continued to fight and they fought at the side of the river; they endeavored to pass but were not able, so some of them sank in the pits and died.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>18</sup> So the king ordered them to cut down trees to make rafts, upon which they might pass to them, and they did so.</p>
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And when they came to the place of the ditches, the waters revolved by mills, and two hundred men upon ten rafts were drowned.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And on the third day they came to fight at the side where the serpents were, but they could not approach there, for the serpents slew of them one hundred and seventy men, and they ceased fighting against Cush, and they besieged Cush for nine years, no person came out or
                      in.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>21</sup> At that time that the war and the siege were against Cush, Moses fled from Egypt from Pharaoh who sought to kill him for having slain the Egyptian.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And Moses was eighteen years old when he fled from Egypt from the presence of Pharaoh, and he fled and escaped to the camp of Kikianus, which at that time was besieging Cush.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And Moses was nine years in the camp of Kikianus king of Cush, all the time that they were besieging Cush, and Moses went out and came in with them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And the king and princes and all the fighting men loved Moses, for he was great and worthy, his stature was like a noble lion, his face was like the sun, and his strength was like that of a lion, and he was counsellor to the king.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And at the end of nine years, Kikianus was seized with a mortal disease, and his illness prevailed over him, and he died on the seventh day.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>26</sup> So his servants embalmed him and carried him and buried him opposite the city gate to the north of the land of Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And they built over him an elegant strong and high building, and they placed great stones below.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And the king's scribes engraved upon those stones all the might of their king Kikianus, and all his battles which he had fought, behold they are written there at this day.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>29</sup> Now after the death of Kikianus king of Cush it grieved his men and troops greatly on account of the war.</p> 
                      <p><sup>30</sup> So they said one to the other, Give us counsel what we are to do at this time, as we have resided in the wilderness nine years away from our homes.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>31</sup> If we say we will fight against the city many of us will fall wounded or killed, and if we remain here in the siege we shall also die.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>32</sup> For now all the kings of Aram and of the children of the east will hear that our king is dead, and they will attack us suddenly in a hostile manner, and they will fight against us and leave no remnant of us.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>33</sup> Now therefore let us go and make a king over us, and let us remain in the siege until the city is delivered up to us.</p>
                      <p><sup>34</sup> And they wished to choose on that day a man for king from the army of Kikianus, and they found no object of their choice like Moses to reign over them.</p>                  
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And they hastened and stripped off each man his garments and cast them upon the ground, and they made a great heap and placed Moses thereon.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And they rose up and blew with trumpets and called out before him, and said, May the king live, may the king live!</p>
                      <p><sup>37</sup> And all the people and nobles swore unto him to give him for a wife Adoniah the queen, the Cushite, wife of Kikianus, and they made Moses king over them on that day.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And all the people of Cush issued a proclamation on that day, saying, Every man must give something to Moses of what is in his possession.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>39</sup> And they spread out a sheet upon the heap, and every man cast into it something of what he had, one a gold earring and the other a coin.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>40</sup> Also of onyx stones, bdellium, pearls and marble did the children of Cush cast unto Moses upon the heap, also silver and gold in great abundance.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And Moses took all the silver and gold, all the vessels, and the bdellium and onyx stones, which all the children of Cush had given to him, and he placed them amongst his treasures.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>42</sup> And Moses reigned over the children of Cush on that day, in the place of Kikianus king of Cush.</p>
          
                    

        <H2>Chapter 9</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> The Reign of Moses, and his Strategic Warfare.</p>



                      <p><sup>1</sup> In the fifty-fifth year of the reign of Pharaoh king of Egypt, that is in the hundred and fifty-seventh year of the Israelites going down into Egypt, reigned Moses in Cush.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> Moses was twenty-seven years old when he began to reign over Cush, and forty years did he reign.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And the Lord granted Moses favor and grace in the eyes of all the children of Cush, and the children of Cush loved him exceedingly, so Moses was favored by the Lord and by men.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And in the seventh day of his reign, all the children of Cush assembled and came before Moses and bowed down to him to the ground.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And all the children spoke together in the presence of the king, saying, Give us counsel that we may see what is to be done to this city.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>6</sup> For it is now nine years that we have been besieging round about the city, and have not seen our children and our wives.</p>
                      <p><sup>7</sup> So the king answered them, saying, If you will hearken to my voice in all that I shall command you, then will the Lord give the city into our hands and we shall subdue it.</p>                   
                      <p><sup>8</sup> For if we fight with them as in the former battle which we had with them before the death of Kikianus, many of us will fall down wounded as before.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> Now therefore behold here is counsel for you in this matter; if you will hearken to my voice, then will the city be delivered into our hands.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> So all the forces answered the king, saying, All that our lord shall command that will we do.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And Moses said unto them, Pass through and proclaim a voice in the whole camp unto all the people, saying,</p> 
                      <p><sup>12</sup> Thus says the king, Go into the forest and bring with you of the young ones of the stork, each man a young one in his hand.</p>
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And any person transgressing the word of the king, who shall not bring his young one, he shall die, and the king will take all belonging to him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And when you shall bring them they shall be in your keeping, you shall rear them until they grow up, and you shall teach them to dart upon, as is the way of the young ones of the hawk.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>15</sup> So all the children of Cush heard the words of Moses, and they rose up and caused a proclamation to be issued throughout the camp, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> Unto you, all the children of Cush, the king's order is, that you go all together to the forest, and catch there the young storks each man his young one in his hand, and you shall bring them home.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And any person violating the order of the king shall die, and the king will take all that belongs to him.</p> 
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And all the people did so, and they went out to the wood and they climbed the fir trees and caught, each man a young one in his hand, all the young of the storks, and they brought them into the desert and reared them by order of the king, and they taught them to dart upon,
                      similar to the young hawks.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And after the young storks were reared, the king ordered them to be hungered for three days, and all the people did so.</p>
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And on the third day, the king said unto them, strengthen yourselves and become valiant men, and put on each man his armor and gird on his sword upon him, and ride each man his horse and take each his young stork in his hand.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And we will rise up and fight against the city at the place where the serpents are; and all the people did as the king had ordered.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And they took each man his young one in his hand, and they went away, and when they came to the place of the serpents the king said to them, Send forth each man his young stork upon the serpents.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And they sent forth each man his young stork at the king's order, and the young storks ran upon the serpents and they devoured them all and destroyed them out of that place.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And when the king and people had seen that all the serpents were destroyed in that place, all the people set up a great shout.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And they approached and fought against the city and took it and subdued it, and they entered the city.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And there died on that day one thousand and one hundred men of the people of the city, all that inhabited the city, but of the people besieging not one died.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>27</sup> So all the children of Cush went each to his home, to his wife and children and to all belonging to him.</p> 
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And Balaam the magician, when he saw that the city was taken, he opened the gate and he and his two sons and eight brothers fled and returned to Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>29</sup> They are the sorcerers and magicians who are mentioned in the book of the law, standing against Moses when the Lord brought the plagues upon Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>30</sup> So Moses took the city by his wisdom, and the children of Cush placed him on the throne instead of Kikianus king of Cush.</p>
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And they placed the royal crown upon his head, and they gave him for a wife Adoniah the Cushite queen, wife of Kikianus.</p>
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And Moses feared the Lord God of his fathers, so that he came not to her, nor did he turn his eyes to her.</p> 
                      <p><sup>33</sup> For Moses remembered how Abraham had made his servant Eliezer swear, saying unto him, Thou shalt not take a woman from the daughters of Canaan for my son Isaac.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>34</sup> Also what Isaac did when Jacob had fled from his brother, when he commanded him, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan, nor make alliance with any of the children of Ham.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>35</sup> For the Lord our God gave Ham the son of Noah, and his children and all his seed, as slaves to the children of Shem and to the children of Japheth, and unto their seed after them for slaves, forever.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>36</sup> Therefore Moses turned not his heart nor his eyes to the wife of Kikianus all the days that he reigned over Cush.</p> 
                      <p><sup>37</sup> And Moses feared the Lord his God all his life, and Moses walked before the Lord in truth, with all his heart and soul, he turned not from the right way all the days of his life; he declined not from the way either to the right or to the left, in which Abraham, Isaac and Jacob had walked.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And Moses strengthened himself in the kingdom of the children of Cush, and he guided the children of Cush with his usual wisdom, and Moses prospered in his kingdom.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>39</sup> And at that time Aram and the children of the east heard that Kikianus king of Cush had died, so Aram and the children of the east rebelled against Cush in those days.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>40</sup> And Moses gathered all the children of Cush, a people very mighty, about thirty thousand men, and he went forth to fight with Aram and the children of the east.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And they went at first to the children of the east, and when the children of the east heard their report, they went to meet them, and engaged in battle with them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>42</sup> And the war was severe against the children of the east, so the Lord gave all the children of the east into the hand of Moses, and about three hundred men fell down slain.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>43</sup> And all the children of the east turned back and retreated, so Moses and the children of Cush followed them and subdued them, and put a tax upon them, as was their custom.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>44</sup> So Moses and all the people with him passed from there to the land of Aram for battle.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>45</sup> And the people of Aram also went to meet them, and they fought against them, and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Moses, and many of the men of Aram fell down wounded.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>46</sup> And Aram also were subdued by Moses and the people of Cush, and also gave their usual tax.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>47</sup> And Moses brought Aram and the children of the east under subjection to the children of Cush, and Moses and all the people who were with him, turned to the land of Cush.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>48</sup> And Moses strengthened himself in the kingdom of the children of Cush, and the Lord was with him, and all the children of Cush were afraid of him.</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"> War in Africa.</p>
     
                
                    
                      <p><sup>1</sup> In the end of years died Saul king of Edom, and Baal Chanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place.</p>
                      <p><sup>2</sup> In the sixteenth year of the reign of Moses over Cush, Baal Chanan the son of Achbor reigned in the land of Edom over all the children of Edom for thirty-eight years.</p>
                      <p><sup>3</sup> In his days Moab rebelled against the power of Edom, having been under Edom since the days of Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote them and Midian, and brought Moab under subjection to Edom.</p>
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And when Baal Chanan the son of Achbor reigned over Edom, all the children of Moab withdrew their allegiance from Edom.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And Angeas king of Africa died in those days, and Azdrubal his son reigned in his stead.</p>
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And in those days died Janeas king of the children of Chittim, and they buried him in his temple which he had built for himself in the plain of Canopia for a residence, and Latinus reigned in his stead.</p>
                      <p><sup>7</sup> In the twenty-second year of the reign of Moses over the children of Cush, Latinus reigned over the children of Chittim forty-five years.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And he also built for himself a great and mighty tower, and he built therein an elegant temple for his residence, to conduct his government, as was the custom.</p>
                      <p><sup>9</sup> In the third year of his reign he caused a proclamation to be made to all his skilful men, who made many ships for him.</p>
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And Latinus assembled all his forces, and they came in ships, and went therein to fight with Azdrubal son of Angeas king of Africa, and they came to Africa and engaged in battle with Azdrubal and his army.</p>
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And Latinus prevailed over Azdrubal, and Latinus took from Azdrubal the aqueduct which his father had brought from the children of Chittim, when he took Janiah the daughter of Uzi for a wife, so Latinus overthrew the bridge of the aqueduct, and smote the whole army of
                      Azdrubal a severe blow.</p>
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And the remaining strong men of Azdrubal strengthened themselves, and their hearts were filled with envy, and they courted death, and again engaged in battle with Latinus king of Chittim.</p>
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And the battle was severe upon all the men of Africa, and they all fell wounded before Latinus and his people, and Azdrubal the king also fell in that battle.</p>
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And the king Azdrubal had a very beautiful daughter, whose name was Ushpezena, and all the men of Africa embroidered her likeness on their garments, on account of her great beauty and comely appearance.</p>
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And the men of Latinus saw Ushpezena, the daughter of Azdrubal, and praised her unto Latinus their king.</p>
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And Latinus ordered her to be brought to him, and Latinus took Ushpezena for a wife, and he turned back on his way to Chittim.</p>
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And it was after the death of Azdrubal son of Angeas, when Latinus had turned back to his land from the battle, that all the inhabitants of Africa rose up and took Anibal the son of Angeas, the younger brother of Azdrubal, and made him king instead at his brother over the whole land at Africa.</p>                   
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And when he reigned, he resolved to go to Chittim to fight with the children of Chittim, to avenge the cause of Azdrubal his brother, and the cause of the inhabitants of Africa, and he did so.</p>
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And he made many ships, and he came therein with his whole army, and he went to Chittim.</p>     
                      <p><sup>20</sup> So Anibal fought with the children of Chittim, and the children of Chittim fell wounded before Anibal and his army, and Anibal avenged his brother's cause.</p>
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And Anibal continued the war for eighteen years with the children of Chittim, and Anibal dwelt in the land of Chittim and encamped there for a long time.</p>
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And Anibal smote the children of Chittim very severely, and he slew their great men and princes, and of the rest of the people he smote about eighty thousand men.</p>   
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And at the end of days and years, Anibal returned to his land of Africa, and he reigned securely in the place of Azdrubal his brother.</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"> Thirty Thousand Ephraimites think it Time to get out of Egypt, Rise up to go to Canaan, but are Slain by the Philistines.</p>


                                             
                      <p><sup>1</sup> At that time, in the hundred and eightieth year of the Israelites going down into Egypt, there went forth from Egypt valiant men, thirty thousand on foot, from the children of Israel, who were all of the tribe of Joseph, of the children of Ephraim the son of Joseph.</p>
                      <p><sup>2</sup> For they said the period was completed which the Lord had appointed to the children of Israel in the times of old, which he had spoken to Abraham.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And these men girded themselves, and they put each man his sword at his side, and every man his armor upon him, and they trusted to their strength, and they went out together from Egypt with a mighty hand.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> But they brought no provision for the road, only silver and gold, not even bread for that day did they bring in their hands, for they thought of getting their provision for pay from the Philistines, and if not they would take it by force.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And these men were very mighty and valiant men, one man could pursue a thousand and two could rout ten thousand, so they trusted to their strength and went together as they were.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And they directed their course toward the land of Gath, and they went down and found the shepherds of Gath feeding the cattle of the children of Gath.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And they said to the shepherds, Give us some of the sheep for pay, that we may eat, for we are hungry, for we have eaten no bread this day.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And the shepherds said, Are they our sheep or cattle that we should give them to you even for pay? so the children of Ephraim approached to take them by force.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And the shepherds of Gath shouted over them that their cry was heard at a distance, so all the children of Gath went out to them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And when the children of Gath saw the evil doings of the children of Ephraim, they returned and assembled the men of Gath, and they put on each man his armor, and came forth to the children of Ephraim for battle.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And they engaged with them in the valley of Gath, and the battle was severe, and they smote from each other a great many on that day.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And on the second day the children of Gath sent to all the cities of the Philistines that they should come to their help, saying,</p>                       
                      <p><sup>13</sup> Come up unto us and help us, that we may smite the children of Ephraim who have come forth from Egypt to take our cattle, and to fight against us without cause.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>14</sup> Now the souls of the children of Ephraim were exhausted with hunger and thirst, for they had eaten no bread for three days. And forty thousand men went forth from the cities of the Philistines to the assistance of the men of Gath.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And these men were engaged in battle with the children of Ephraim, and the Lord delivered the children of Ephraim into the hands of the Philistines.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And they smote all the children of Ephraim, all who had gone forth from Egypt, none were remaining but ten men who had run away from the engagement.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>17</sup> For this evil was from the Lord against the children of Ephraim, for they transgressed the word of the Lord in going forth from Egypt, before the period had arrived which the Lord in the days of old had appointed to Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And of the Philistines also there fell a great many, about twenty thousand men, and their brethren carried them and buried them in their cities.</p>                    
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And the slain of the children of Ephraim remained forsaken in the valley of Gath for many days and years, and were not brought to burial, and the valley was filled with men's bones.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And the men who had escaped from the battle came to Egypt, and told all the children of Israel all that had befallen them.</p>
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And their father Ephraim mourned over them for many days, and his brethren came to console him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And he came unto his wife and she bare a son, and he called his name Beriah, for she was unfortunate in his house.</p>
                  
        
                    
        <H2>Chapter 12</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Moses leaves Cush and goes to the Land of Midian. Reuel, taking him for a Refugee, keeps him in prison for Ten Years. Is fed by Zipporah, the Daughter of Reuel. Pharaoh smitten of the Plague. Slays a child of the Israelites every day. He dies of the Rot,
          and his Son, Adikam, Reigns in his Stead.</p>



                                             
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And Moses the son of Amram was still king in the land of Cush in those days, and he prospered in his kingdom, and he conducted the government of the children of Cush in justice, in righteousness, and integrity.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And all the children of Cush loved Moses all the days that he reigned over them, and all the inhabitants of the land of Cush were greatly afraid of him.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And in the fortieth year of the reign of Moses over Cush, Moses was sitting on the royal throne whilst Adoniah the queen was before him, and all the nobles were sitting around him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And Adoniah the queen said before the king and the princes, What is this thing which you, the children of Cush, have done for this long time?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> Surely you know that for forty years that this man has reigned over Cush he has not approached me, nor has he served the gods of the children of Cush.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>6</sup> Now therefore hear, O ye children of Cush, and let this man no more reign over you as he is not of our flesh.</p>
                      <p><sup>7</sup> Behold Menacrus my son is grown up, let him reign over you, for it is better for you to serve the son of your lord, than to serve a stranger, slave of the king of Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And all the people and nobles of the children of Cush heard the words which Adoniah the queen had spoken in their ears.</p>
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And all the people were preparing until the evening, and in the morning they rose up early and made Menacrus, son of Kikianus, king over them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And all the children of Cush were afraid to stretch forth their hand against Moses, for the Lord was with Moses, and the children of Cush remembered the oath which they swore unto Moses, therefore they did no harm to him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>11</sup> But the children of Cush gave many presents to Moses, and sent him from them with great honor.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> So Moses went forth from the land of Cush, and went home and ceased to reign over Cush, and Moses was sixty-six years old when he went out of the land of Cush, for the thing was from the Lord, for the period had arrived which he had appointed in the days of old, to bring forth Israel from the affliction of the children of Ham.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>13</sup> So Moses went to Midian, for he was afraid to return to Egypt on account of Pharaoh, and he went and sat at a well of water in Midian.</p>                  
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And the seven daughters of Reuel the Midianite went out to feed their father's flock.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And they came to the well and drew water to water their father's flock.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>16</sup> So the shepherds of Midian came and drove them away, and Moses rose up and helped them and watered the flock.</p> 
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And they came home to their father Reuel, and told him what Moses did for them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And they said, An Egyptian man has delivered us from the hands of the shepherds, he drew up water for us and watered the flock.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And Reuel said to his daughters, And where is he? wherefore have you left the man?</p>                       
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And Reuel sent for him and fetched him and brought him home, and he ate bread with him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And Moses related to Reuel that he had fled from Egypt and that he reigned forty years over Cush, and that they afterward had taken the government from him, and had sent him away in peace with honor and with presents.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And when Reuel had heard the words of Moses, Reuel said within himself, I will put this man into the prison house, whereby I shall conciliate the children of Cush, for he has fled from them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And they took and put him into the prison house, and Moses was in prison ten years, and whilst Moses was in the prison house, Zipporah the daughter of Reuel took pity over him, and supported him with bread and water all the time.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And all the children of Israel were yet in the land of Egypt serving the Egyptians in all manner of hard work, and the hand of Egypt continued in severity over the children of Israel in those days.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>25</sup> At that time the Lord smote Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he afflicted with the plague of leprosy from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head; owing to the cruel treatment of the children of Israel was this plague at that time from the Lord upon Pharaoh king of Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>26</sup> For the Lord had hearkened to the prayer of his people the children of Israel, and their cry reached him on account of their hard work.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>27</sup> Still his anger did not turn from them, and the hand of Pharaoh was still stretched out against the children of Israel, and Pharaoh hardened his neck before the Lord, and he increased his yoke over the children of Israel, and embittered their lives with all manner of
                      hard work.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And when the Lord had inflicted the plague upon Pharaoh king of Egypt, he asked his wise men and sorcerers to cure him.</p>
                      <p><sup>29</sup> And his wise men and sorcerers said unto him, That if the blood of little children were put into the wounds he would be healed.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And Pharaoh hearkened to them, and sent his ministers to Goshen to the children of Israel to take their little children.</p>
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And Pharaoh's ministers went and took the infants of the children of Israel from the bosoms of their mothers by force, and they brought them to Pharaoh daily, a child each day, and the physicians killed them and applied them to the plague; thus did they all the days.</p>
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And the number of the children which Pharaoh slew was three hundred and seventy-five.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>33</sup> But the Lord hearkened not to the physicians of the king of Egypt, and the plague went on increasing mightily.</p>
                      <p><sup>34</sup> And Pharaoh was ten years afflicted with that plague, still the heart of Pharaoh was more hardened against the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And at the end of ten years the Lord continued to afflict Pharaoh with destructive plagues.</p>                    
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And the Lord smote him with a bad tumor and sickness at the stomach, and that plague turned to a severe boil.</p> 
                      <p><sup>37</sup> At that time the two ministers of Pharaoh came from the land of Goshen where all the children of Israel were, and went to the house of Pharaoh and said to him, We have seen the children of Israel slacken in their work and negligent in their labor.</p> 
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And when Pharaoh heard the words of his ministers, his anger was kindled against the children of Israel exceedingly, for he was greatly grieved at his bodily pain.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>39</sup> And he answered and said, Now that the children of Israel know that I am ill, they turn and scoff at us, now therefore harness my chariot for me, and I will betake myself to Goshen and will see the scoff of the children of Israel with which they are deriding me; so his servants harnessed the chariot for him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>40</sup> And they took and made him ride upon a horse, for he was not able to ride of himself;</p>                       
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And he took with him ten horsemen and ten footmen, and went to the children of Israel to Goshen.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>42</sup> And when they had come to the border of Egypt, the king's horse passed into a narrow place, elevated in the hollow part of the vineyard, fenced on both sides, the low, plain country being on the other side.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>43</sup> And the horses ran rapidly in that place and pressed each other, and the other horses pressed the king's horse.</p> 
                      <p><sup>44</sup> And the king's horse fell into the low plain whilst the king was riding upon it, and when he fell the chariot turned over the king's face and the horse lay upon the king, and the king cried out, for his flesh was very sore.</p>                    
                      <p><sup>45</sup> And the flesh of the king was torn from him, and his bones were broken and he could not ride, for this thing was from the Lord to him, for the Lord had heard the cries of his people the children of Israel and their affliction.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>46</sup> And his servants carried him upon their shoulders, a little at a time, and they brought him back to Egypt, and the horsemen who were with him came also back to Egypt.</p>                    
                      <p><sup>47</sup> And they placed him in his bed, and the king knew that his end was come to die, so Aparanith the queen his wife came and cried before the king, and the king wept a great weeping with her.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>48</sup> And all his nobles and servants came on that day and saw the king in that affliction, and wept a great weeping with him.</p>
                      <p><sup>49</sup> And the princes of the king and all his counselors advised the king to cause one to reign in his stead in the land, whomsoever he should choose from his sons.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>50</sup> And the king had three sons and two daughters which Aparanith the queen his wife had borne to him, besides the king's children of concubines.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>51</sup> And these were their names, the firstborn Othri, the second Adikam, and the third Morion, and their sisters, the name of the elder Bathia and of the other Acuzi.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>52</sup> And Othri the first born of the king was an idiot, precipitate and hurried in his words.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>53</sup> But Adikam was a cunning and wise man and knowing in all the wisdom of Egypt, but of unseemly aspect, thick in flesh, and very short in stature; his height was one cubit.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>54</sup> And when the king saw Adikam his son intelligent and wise in all things, the king resolved that he should be king in his stead after his death.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>55</sup> And he took for him a wife Gedudah daughter of Abilot, and he was ten years old, and she bare unto him four sons.</p>
                      <p><sup>56</sup> And he afterward went and took three wives and begat eight sons and three daughters.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>57</sup> And the disorder greatly prevailed over the king, and his flesh stank like the flesh of a carcass cast upon the field in summer time, during the heat of the sun.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>58</sup> And when the king saw that his sickness had greatly strengthened itself over him, he ordered his son Adikam to be brought to him, and they made him king over the land in his place.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>59</sup> And at the end of three years, the king died, in shame, disgrace, and disgust, and his servants carried him and buried him in the sepulcher of the kings of Egypt in Zoan Mizraim.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>60</sup> But they embalmed him not as was usual with kings, for his flesh was putrid, and they could not approach to embalm him on account of the stench, so they buried him in haste.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>61</sup> For this evil was from the Lord to him, for the Lord had requited him evil for the evil which in his days he had done to Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>62</sup> And he died with terror and with shame, and his son Adikam reigned in his place.</p>
    


        <H2>Chapter 13</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle">Adikam Pharaoh Afflicts Israel more than ever. Moses is Released by Reuel, and Marries his Daughter Zipporah. Moses obtains possession of the Stick Jehovah.</p>                   


                    
                      <p><sup>1</sup> Adikam was twenty years old when he reigned over Egypt, he reigned four years.                     
                      <p><sup>2</sup> In the two hundred and sixth year of Israel's going down to Egypt did Adikam reign over Egypt, but he continued not so long in his reign over Egypt as his fathers had continued their reigns.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> For Melol his father reigned ninety-four years in Egypt, but he was ten years sick and died, for he had been wicked before the Lord.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And all the Egyptians called the name of Adikam Pharaoh like the name of his fathers, as was their custom to do in Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And all the wise men of Pharaoh called the name of Adikam Ahuz, for short is called Ahuz in the Egyptian language.</p> 
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And Adikam was exceedingly ugly, and he was a cubit and a span and he had a great beard which reached to the soles of his feet.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And Pharaoh sat upon his father's throne to reign over Egypt, and he conducted the government of Egypt in his wisdom.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And whilst he reigned he exceeded his father and all the preceding kings in wickedness, and he increased his yoke over the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And he went with his servants to Goshen to the children of Israel, and he strengthened the labor over them and he said unto them, Complete your work, each day's task, and let not your hands slacken from our work from this day forward as you did in the days of my father.</p>
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And he placed officers over them from amongst the children of Israel, and over these officers he placed taskmasters from amongst his servants.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And he placed over them a measure of bricks for them to do according to that number, day by day, and he turned back and went to Egypt.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> At that time the task-masters of Pharaoh ordered the officers of the children of Israel according to the command of Pharaoh, saying,</p>                     
                      <p><sup>13</sup> Thus says Pharaoh, Do your work each day, and finish your task, and observe the daily measure of bricks; diminish not anything.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And it shall come to pass that if you are deficient in your daily bricks, I will put your young children in their stead.</p>
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And the task-masters of Egypt did so in those days as Pharaoh had ordered them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And whenever any deficiency was found in the children of Israel's measure of their daily bricks, the task-masters of Pharaoh would go to the wives of the children of Israel and take infants of the children of Israel to the number of bricks deficient, they would take them by force from their mother's laps, and put them in the building instead of the bricks;</p>                       
                      <p><sup>17</sup> Whilst their fathers and mothers were crying over them and weeping when they heard the weeping voices of their infants in the wall of the building.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And the task-masters prevailed over Israel, that the Israelites should place their children in the building, so that a man placed his son in the wall and put mortar over him, whilst his eyes wept over him, and his tears ran down upon his child.</p> 
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And the task-masters of Egypt did so to the babes of Israel for many days, and no one pitied or had compassion over the babes of the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And the number of all the children killed in the building was two hundred and seventy, some whom they had built upon instead of the bricks which had been left deficient by their fathers, and some whom they had drawn out dead from the building.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And the labor imposed upon the children of Israel in the days of Adikam exceeded in hardship that which they performed in the days of his father.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And the children of Israel sighed every day on account of their heavy work, for they had said to themselves, Behold when Pharaoh shall die, his son will rise up and lighten our work!</p>                       
                      <p><sup>23</sup> But they increased the latter work more than the former, and the children of Israel sighed at this and their cry ascended to God on account of their labor.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And God heard the voice of the children of Israel and their cry, in those days, and God remembered to them his covenant which he had made with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And God saw the burden of the children of Israel, and their heavy work in those days, and he determined to deliver them.</p>
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And Moses the son of Amram was still confined in the dungeon in those days, in the house of Reuel the Midianite, and Zipporah the daughter of Reuel did support him with food secretly day by day.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And Moses was confined in the dungeon in the house of Reuel for ten years.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And at the end of ten years which was the first year of the reign of Pharaoh over Egypt, in the place of his father,</p>
                      <p><sup>29</sup> Zipporah said to her father Reuel, No person inquires or seeks after the Hebrew man, whom thou didst bind in prison now ten years.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>30</sup> Now therefore, if it seem good in thy sight, let us send and see whether he is living or dead, but her father knew not that she had supported him.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And Reuel her father answered and said to her, Has ever such a thing happened that a man should be shut up in a prison without food for ten years, and that he should live?</p>                      
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And Zipporah answered her father, saying, Surely thou hast heard that the God of the Hebrews is great and awful, and does wonders for them at all times.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>33</sup> He it was who delivered Abraham from Ur of the Chaldeans, and Isaac from the sword of his father, and Jacob from the angel of the Lord who wrestled with him at the ford of Jabbuk.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>34</sup> Also with this man has he done many things, he delivered him from the river in Egypt and from the sword of Pharaoh, and from the children of Cush, so also can he deliver him from famine and make him live.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And the thing seemed good in the sight of Reuel, and he did according to the word of his daughter, and sent to the dungeon to ascertain what became of Moses.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And he saw, and behold the man Moses was living in the dungeon, standing upon his feet, praising and praying to the God of his ancestors.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>37</sup> And Reuel commanded Moses to be brought out of the dungeon, so they shaved him and he changed his prison garments and ate bread.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And afterward Moses went into the garden of Reuel which was behind the house, and he there prayed to the Lord his God, who had done mighty wonders for him.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>39</sup> And it was that whilst he prayed he looked opposite to him, and behold a sapphire stick was placed in the ground, which was planted in the midst of the garden.</p>
                      <p><sup>40</sup> And he approached the stick and he looked, and behold the name of the Lord God of hosts was engraved thereon, written and developed upon the stick.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And he read it and stretched forth his hand and he plucked it like a forest tree from the thicket, and the stick was in his hand.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>42</sup> And this is the stick with which all the works of our God were performed, after he had created heaven and earth, and all the host of them, seas, rivers and all their fishes.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>43</sup> And when God had driven Adam from the garden of Eden, he took the stick in his hand and went and tilled the ground from which he was taken.</p>                     
                      <p><sup>44</sup> And the stick came down to Noah and was given to Shem and his descendants, until it came into the hand of Abraham the Hebrew.</p>
                      <p><sup>45</sup> And when Abraham had given all he had to his son Isaac, he also gave to him this stick.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>46</sup> And when Jacob had fled to Padan-aram, he took it into his hand, and when he returned to his father he had not left it behind him.</p>                   
                      <p><sup>47</sup> Also when he went down to Egypt he took it into his hand and gave it to Joseph, one portion above his brethren, for Jacob had taken it by force from his brother Esau.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>48</sup> And after the death of Joseph, the nobles of Egypt came into the house of Joseph, and the stick came into the hand of Reuel the Midianite, and when he went out of Egypt, he took it in his hand and planted it in his garden.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>49</sup> And all the mighty men of the Kinites tried to pluck it when they endeavored to get Zipporah his daughter, but they were unsuccessful.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>50</sup> So that stick remained planted in the garden of Reuel, until he came who had a right to it and took it.</p>
                      <p><sup>51</sup> And when Reuel saw the stick in the hand of Moses, he wondered at it, and he gave him his daughter Zipporah for a wife.</p>
          


        <H2>Chapter 14</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Moses has Two Sons. Pharaoh withholds Straw from the Israelites.</p>

                    
                         
                      <p><sup>1</sup> At that time died Baal Channan son of Achbor, king of Edom, and was buried in his house in the land of Edom.</p>
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And after his death the children of Esau sent to the land of Edom, and took from there a man who was in Edom, whose name was Hadad, and they made him king over them in the place of Baal Channan, their king.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And Hadad reigned over the children of Edom forty-eight years.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And when he reigned he resolved to fight against the children of Moab, to bring them under the power of the children of Esau as they were before, but he was not able, because the children of Moab heard this thing, and they rose up and hastened to elect a king over them
                      from amongst their brethren.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And they afterward gathered together a great people, and sent to the children of Ammon their brethren for help to fight against Hadad king of Edom.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And Hadad heard the thing which the children of Moab had done, and was greatly afraid of them, and refrained from fighting against them.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>7</sup> In those days Moses, the son of Amram, in Midian, took Zipporah, the daughter of Reuel the Midianite, for a wife.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And Zipporah walked in the ways of the daughters of Jacob, she was nothing short of the righteousness of Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel and Leah.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And Zipporah conceived and bare a son and he called his name Gershom, for he said, I was a stranger in a foreign land; but he circumcised not his foreskin, at the command of Reuel his father-in-law.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And she conceived again and bare a son, but circumcised his foreskin, and called his name Eliezer, for Moses said, Because the God of my fathers was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And Pharaoh king of Egypt greatly increased the labor of the children of Israel in those days, and continued to make his yoke heavier upon the children of Israel.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And he ordered a proclamation to be made in Egypt, saying, Give no more straw to the people to make bricks with, let them go and gather themselves straw as they can find it.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>13</sup> Also the tale of bricks which they shall make let them give each day, and diminish nothing from them, for they are idle in their work.</p>                       
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And the children of Israel heard this, and they mourned and sighed, and they cried unto the Lord on account of the bitterness of their souls.</p>                      
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And the Lord heard the cries of the children of Israel, and saw the oppression with which the Egyptians oppressed them.</p>
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And the Lord was jealous of his people and his inheritance, and heard their voice, and he resolved to take them out of the affliction of Egypt, to give them the land of Canaan for a possession.</p>
