        <p class="chapterTitle"> Abraham commanded to Offer up Isaac, in the Land Moriah. Abraham's Obedience. Sarah's Affliction. What Happened on the Way. Satan attempts to hinder them. Isaac an Acceptable Offering. Father and Son alone. The willingness of Isaac. He Assists his Father in Building the Altar. While they both weep bitterly, they yet Rejoice to be counted worthy before the Lord. Isaac bound and placed upon the Altar. The Angels of God intercede for Isaac, who is released at the command of the Lord, and a Ram is offered in his place. Satan, by his deception and Evils, causes the Death of Sarah.</p>               
                    
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> At that time the word of the Lord came to Abraham, and he said unto him, Abraham, and he said, Here I am.</p> 
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And he said to him, Take now thy son, thine only son whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which shall be shown to thee, for there wilt thou see a cloud and the glory of the Lord.</p> 
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And Abraham said within himself, How shall I separate my son Isaac from Sarah his mother, in order to bring him up for a burnt offering before the Lord?</p> 
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And Abraham came into the tent, and he sat before Sarah his wife, and he spoke these words to her,</p> 
                    <p><sup>5</sup> My son Isaac is grown up and he has not for some time studied the service of his God, now tomorrow I will go and bring him to Shem, and Eber his son, and there he will learn the ways of the Lord, for they will teach him to know the Lord as well as to know that when he prayeth continually before the Lord, he will answer him, therefore there he will know the way of serving the Lord his God.</p> 
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And Sarah said, Thou hast spoken well, go my lord and do unto him as thou hast said, but remove him not at a great distance from me, neither let him remain there too long, for my soul is bound within his soul.</p> 
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And Abraham said unto Sarah, My daughter, let us pray to the Lord our God that he may do good with us.</p> 
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And Sarah took her son Isaac and he abode all that night with her, and she kissed and embraced him, and gave him instructions till morning.</p> 
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And she said to him, O my son, how can my soul separate itself from thee? And she still kissed him and embraced him, and she gave Abraham instructions concerning him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And Sarah said to Abraham, O my lord, I pray thee take heed of thy son, and place thine eyes over him, for I have no other son nor daughter but him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>11</sup> O forsake him not. If he be hungry give him bread, and if he be thirsty give him water to drink; do not let him go on foot, neither let him sit in the sun.</p> 
                    <p><sup>12</sup> Neither let him go by himself in the road, neither force him from whatever he may desire, but do unto him as he may say to thee.</p> 
                    <p><sup>13</sup> And Sarah wept bitterly the whole night on account of Isaac, and she gave him instructions till morning.</p> 
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And in the morning Sarah selected a very fine and beautiful garment from those garments which she had in the house, that Abimelech had given to her.</p> 
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And she dressed Isaac her son therewith, and she put a turban upon his head, and she enclosed a precious stone in the top of the turban, and she gave them provision for the road, and they went forth, and Isaac went with his father Abraham, and some of their servants accompanied them to see them off the road.</p> 
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And Sarah went out with them, and she accompanied them upon the road to see them off, and they said to her, Return to the tent.</p> 
                    <p><sup>17</sup> And when Sarah heard the words of her son Isaac she wept bitterly, and Abraham her husband wept with her, and their son wept with them a great weeping; also those who went with them wept greatly.</p> 
                    <p><sup>18</sup> And Sarah caught hold of her son Isaac, and she held him in her arms, and she embraced him and continued to weep with him, and Sarah said, Who knoweth if after this day I shall ever see thee again?</p> 
                    <p><sup>19</sup> And they still wept together, Abraham, Sarah and Isaac, and all those that accompanied them on the road wept with them, and Sarah afterward turned away from her son, weeping bitterly, and all her men servants and maid servants returned with her to the tent.</p> 
                    <p><sup>20</sup> And Abraham went with Isaac his son to bring him up as an offering before the Lord, as He had commanded him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>21</sup> And Abraham took two of his young men with him, Ishmael the son of Hagar and Eliezer his servant, and they went together with them, and whilst they were walking in the road the young men spoke these words to themselves,</p> 
                    <p><sup>22</sup> And Ishmael said to Eliezer, Now my father Abraham is going with Isaac to bring him up for a burnt offering to the Lord, as He commanded him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>23</sup> Now when he returneth he will give unto me all that he possesses, to inherit after him, for I am his first born.</p> 
                    <p><sup>24</sup> And Eliezer answered Ishmael and said, Surely Abraham did cast thee away with thy mother, and swear that thou shouldst not inherit any thing of all he possesses, and to whom will he give all that he has, with all his treasures, but unto me his servant, who has been faithful in his house, who has served him night and day, and has done all that he desired me? to me will he bequeath at his death all that he possesses.</p> 
                    <p><sup>25</sup> And whilst Abraham was proceeding with his son Isaac along the road, Satan came and appeared to Abraham in the figure of a very aged man, humble and of contrite spirit, and he approached Abraham and said to him, Art thou silly or brutish, that thou goest to do this thing this day to thine only son?</p> 
                    <p><sup>26</sup> For God gave thee a son in thy latter days, in thy old age, and wilt thou go and slaughter him this day because he committed no violence, and wilt thou cause the soul of thine only son to perish from the earth?</p> 
                    <p><sup>27</sup> Dost thou not know and understand that this thing cannot be from the Lord? for the Lord cannot do unto man such evil upon earth to say to him, Go slaughter thy child.</p> 
                    <p><sup>28</sup> And Abraham heard this and knew that it was the word of Satan who endeavored to draw him aside from the way of the Lord, but Abraham would not hearken to the voice of Satan, and Abraham rebuked him so that he went away.</p> 
                    <p><sup>29</sup> And Satan returned and came to Isaac; and he appeared unto Isaac in the figure of a young man comely and well favored.</p> 
                    <p><sup>30</sup> And he approached Isaac and said unto him, Dost thou not know and understand that thy old silly father bringeth thee to the slaughter this day for naught?</p> 
                    <p><sup>31</sup> Now therefore, my son, do not listen nor attend to him, for he is a silly old man, and let not thy precious soul and beautiful figure be lost from the earth.</p> 
                    <p><sup>32</sup> And Isaac heard this, and said unto Abraham, Hast thou heard, my father, that which this man has spoken? even thus has he spoken.</p> 
                    <p><sup>33</sup> And Abraham answered his son Isaac and said to him, Take heed of him and do not listen to his words, nor attend to him, for he is Satan, endeavoring to draw us aside this day from the commands of God.</p> 
                    <p><sup>34</sup> And Abraham still rebuked Satan, and Satan went from them, and seeing he could not prevail over them he hid himself from them, and he went and passed before them in the road; and he transformed himself to a large brook of water in the road, and Abraham and Isaac and his two young men reached that place, and they saw a brook large and powerful as the mighty waters.</p> 
                    <p><sup>35</sup> And they entered the brook and passed through it, and the waters at first reached their legs.</p> 
                    <p><sup>36</sup> And they went deeper in the brook and the waters reached up to their necks, and they were all terrified on account of the water; and whilst they were going over the brook Abraham recognized that place, and he knew that there was no water there before.</p> 
                    <p><sup>37</sup> And Abraham said to his son Isaac, I know this place in which there was no brook nor water, now therefore it is this Satan who does all this to us, to draw us aside this day from the commands of God.</p> 
                    <p><sup>38</sup> And Abraham rebuked him and said unto him, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, begone from us for we go by the commands of God.</p> 
                    <p><sup>39</sup> And Satan was terrified at the voice of Abraham, and he went away from them, and the place again became dry land as it was at first.</p> 
                    <p><sup>40</sup> And Abraham went with Isaac toward the place that God had told him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>41</sup> And on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place at a distance which God had told him of.</p> 
                    <p><sup>42</sup> And a pillar of fire appeared to him that reached from the earth to heaven, and a cloud of glory upon the mountain, and the glory of the Lord was seen in the cloud.</p> 
                    <p><sup>43</sup> And Abraham said to Isaac, My son, dost thou see in that mountain, which we perceive at a distance, that which I see upon it?</p> 
                    <p><sup>44</sup> And Isaac answered and said unto his father, I see and lo a pillar of fire and a cloud, and the glory of the Lord is seen upon the cloud.</p> 
                    <p><sup>45</sup> And Abraham knew that his son Isaac was accepted before the Lord for a burnt offering.</p> 
                    <p><sup>46</sup> And Abraham said unto Eliezer and unto Ishmael his son, Do you also see that which we see upon the mountain which is at a distance?</p> 
                    <p><sup>47</sup> And they answered and said, We see nothing more than like the other mountains of the earth. And Abraham knew that they were not accepted before the Lord to go with them, and Abraham said to them, Abide ye here with the ass whilst I and Isaac my son will go to yonder mount and worship there before the Lord and then return to you.</p> 
                    <p><sup>48</sup> And Eliezer and Ishmael remained in that place, as Abraham had commanded.</p> 
                    <p><sup>49</sup> And Abraham took wood for a burnt offering and placed it upon his son Isaac, and he took the fire and the knife, and they both went to that place.</p> 
                    <p><sup>50</sup> And when they were going along Isaac said to his father, Behold, I see here the fire and wood, and where then is the lamb that is to be the burnt offering before the Lord?</p> 
                    <p><sup>51</sup> And Abraham answered his son Isaac, saying, The Lord has made choice of thee my son, to be a perfect burnt offering instead of the lamb.</p> 
                    <p><sup>52</sup> And Isaac said unto his father, I will do all that the Lord spoke to thee with joy and cheerfulness of heart.</p> 
                    <p><sup>53</sup> And Abraham again said unto Isaac his son, Is there in thy heart any thought or counsel concerning this, which is not proper? tell me my son, I pray thee, O my son conceal it not from me.</p> 
                    <p><sup>54</sup> And Isaac answered his father Abraham and said unto him, O my father, as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth, there is nothing in my heart to cause me to deviate either to the right or to the left from the word that he has spoken to thee.</p> 
                    <p><sup>55</sup> Neither limb nor muscle has moved or stirred at this, nor is there in my heart any thought or evil counsel concerning this.</p> 
                    <p><sup>56</sup> But I am of joyful and cheerful heart in this matter, and I say, Blessed is the Lord who has this day chosen me to be a burnt offering before Him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>57</sup> And Abraham greatly rejoiced at the words of Isaac, and they went on and came together to that place that the Lord had spoken of.</p> 
                    <p><sup>58</sup> And Abraham approached to build the altar in that place, and Abraham was weeping, and Isaac took stones and mortar until they had finished building the altar.</p> 
                    <p><sup>59</sup> And Abraham took the wood and placed it in order upon the altar which he had built.</p> 
                    <p><sup>60</sup> And he took his son Isaac and bound him in order to place him upon the wood which was upon the altar, to slay him for a burnt offering before the Lord.</p> 
                    <p><sup>61</sup> And Isaac said to his father, Bind me securely and then place me upon the altar lest I should turn and move, and break loose from the force of the knife upon my flesh and thereof profane the burnt offering; and Abraham did so.</p> 
                    <p><sup>62</sup> And Isaac still said to his father, O my father, when thou shalt have slain me and burnt me for an offering, take with thee that which shall remain of my ashes to bring to Sarah my mother, and say to her, This is the sweet smelling savor of Isaac; but do not tell her this if she should sit near a well or upon any high place, lest she should cast her soul after me and die.</p> 
                    <p><sup>63</sup> And Abraham heard the words of Isaac, and he lifted up his voice and wept when Isaac spake these words; and Abraham's tears gushed down upon Isaac his son, and Isaac wept bitterly, and he said to his father, Hasten thou, O my father, and do with me the will of the Lord our God as He has commanded thee.</p> 
                    <p><sup>64</sup> And the hearts of Abraham and Isaac rejoiced at this thing which the Lord had commanded them; but the eye wept bitterly whilst the heart rejoiced.</p> 
                    <p><sup>65</sup> And Abraham bound his son Isaac, and placed him on the altar upon the wood, and Isaac stretched forth his neck upon the altar before his father, and Abraham stretched forth his hand to take the knife to slay his son as a burnt offering before the Lord.</p> 
                    <p><sup>66</sup> At that time the angels of mercy came before the Lord and spake to him concerning Isaac, saying,</p> 
                    <p><sup>67</sup> 0 Lord, thou art a merciful and compassionate King over all that thou hast created in heaven and in earth, and thou supportest them all; give therefore ransom and redemption instead of thy servant Isaac, and pity and have compassion upon Abraham and Isaac his son, who are this day performing thy commands.</p> 
                    <p><sup>68</sup> Hast thou seen, O Lord, how Isaac the son of Abraham thy servant is bound down to the slaughter like an animal? now therefore let thy pity be roused for them, O Lord.</p> 
                    <p><sup>69</sup> At that time the Lord appeared unto Abraham, and called to him, from heaven, and said unto him, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him, for now I know that thou fearest God in performing this act, and in not withholding thy son, thine only son, from me.</p>  
                    <p><sup>70</sup> And Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, a ram was caught in a thicket by his horns; that was the ram which the Lord God had created in the earth in the day that he made earth and heaven.</p> 
                    <p><sup>71</sup> For the Lord had prepared this ram from that day, to be a burnt offering instead of Isaac.</p> 
                    <p><sup>72</sup> And this ram was advancing to Abraha/m when Satan caught hold of him and entangled his horns in the thicket, that he might not advance to Abraham, in order that Abraham might slay his son.</p> 
                    <p><sup>73</sup> And Abraham, seeing the ram advancing to him and Satan withholding him, fetched him and brought him before the altar, and he loosened his son Isaac from his binding, and he put the ram in his stead, and Abraham killed the ram upon the altar, and brought it up as an offering in the place of his son Isaac.</p> 
                    <p><sup>74</sup> And Abraham sprinkled some of the blood of the ram upon the altar, and he exclaimed and said, This is in the place of my son, and may this be considered this day as the blood of my son before the Lord.</p> 
                    <p><sup>75</sup> And all that Abraham did on this occasion by the altar, he would exclaim and say, This is in the room of my son, and may it this day be considered before the Lord in the place of my son; and Abraham finished the whole of the service by the altar, and the service was accepted before the Lord, and was accounted as if it had been Isaac; and the Lord blessed Abraham and his seed on that day.</p> 
                    <p><sup>76</sup> And Satan went to Sarah, and he appeared to her in the figure of an old man very humble and meek, and Abraham was yet engaged in the burnt offering before the Lord.</p> 
                    <p><sup>77</sup> And he said unto her, Dost thou not know all the work that Abraham has made with thine only son this day? for he took Isaac and built an altar, and killed him, and brought him up as a sacrifice upon the altar, and Isaac cried and wept before his father, but he looked not at him, neither did he have compassion over him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>78</sup> And Satan repeated these words, and he went away from her, and Sarah heard all the words of Satan, and she imagined him to be an old man from amongst the sons of men who had been with her son, and had come and told her these things.</p> 
                    <p><sup>79</sup> And Sarah lifted up her voice and wept and cried out bitterly on account of her son; and she threw herself upon the ground and she cast dust upon her head, and she said, O my son, Isaac my son, O that I had this day died instead of thee. And she continued to weep and said, It grieves me for thee, O my son, my son Isaac, O that I had died this day in thy stead.</p> 
                    <p><sup>80</sup> And she still continued to weep, and said, It grieves me for thee after that I have reared thee and have brought thee up; now my joy is turned into mourning over thee, I that had a longing for thee, and cried and prayed to God till I bare thee at ninety years old; and now hast thou served this day for the knife and the fire, to be made an offering.</p> 
                    <p><sup>81</sup> But I console myself with thee, my son, in its being the word of the Lord, for thou didst perform the command of thy God; for who can transgress the word of our God, in whose hands is the soul of every living creature?</p> 
                    <p><sup>82</sup> Thou art just, O Lord our God, for all thy works are good and righteous; for I also am rejoiced with thy word which thou didst command, and whilst mine eye weepeth bitterly my heart rejoiceth.</p> 
                    <p><sup>83</sup> And Sarah laid her head upon the bosom of one of her handmaids, and she became as still as a stone.</p> 
                    <p><sup>84</sup> She afterward rose up and went about making inquiries till she came to Hebron, and she inquired of all those whom she met walking in the road, and no one could tell her what had happened to her son.</p> 
                    <p><sup>85</sup> And she came with her maid servants and men servants to Kireath-arba, which is Hebron, and she asked concerning her Son, and she remained there while she sent some of her servants to seek where Abraham had gone with Isaac; they went to seek him in the house of Shem and Eber, and they could not find him, and they sought throughout the land and he was not there.</p> 
                    <p><sup>86</sup> And behold, Satan came to Sarah in the shape of an old man, and he came and stood before her, and he said unto her, I spoke falsely unto thee, for Abraham did not kill his son and he is not dead; and when she heard the word her joy was so exceedingly violent on account of her son, that her soul went out through joy; she died and was gathered to her people.</p> 
                    <p><sup>87</sup> And when Abraham had finished his service he returned with his son Isaac to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba, and they came home.</p> 
                    <p><sup>88</sup> And Abraham sought for Sarah, and could not find her, and he made inquiries concerning her, and they said unto him, She went as far as Hebron to seek you both where you had gone, for thus was she informed.</p> 
                    <p><sup>89</sup> And Abraham and Isaac went to her to Hebron, and when they found that she was dead they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly over her; and Isaac fell upon his mother's face and wept over her, and he said, O my mother, my mother, how hast thou left me, and where hast thou gone? O how, how hast thou left me!</p> 
                    <p><sup>90</sup>  And Abraham and Isaac wept greatly and all their servants wept with them on account of Sarah, and they mourned over her a great and heavy mourning.</p> 
                    
                    
                    
        <H2>Chapter 2</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Abraham Purchases a Burial Place. Isaac sent to the House of Shem and Eber to Learn the Way of the Lord. Eliezer is sent to get a Wife for Isaac. Goes to the House of Bethuel and brings Rebecca.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And the life of Sarah was one hundred and twenty-seven years, and Sarah died; and Abraham rose up from before his dead to seek a burial place to bury his wife Sarah; and he went and spoke to the children of Heth, the inhabitants of the land, saying,</p> 
                    <p><sup>2</sup> I am a stranger and a sojourner with you in your land; give me a possession of a burial place in your land, that I may bury my dead from before me.</p> 
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And the children of Heth said unto Abraham, behold the land is before thee, in the choice of our sepulchers bury thy dead, for no man shall withhold thee from burying thy dead.</p> 
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And Abraham said unto them, If you are agreeable to this go and entreat for me to Ephron, the son of Zochar, requesting that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which is in the end of his field, and I will purchase it of him for whatever he desire for it.</p> 
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth, and they went and called for him, and he came before Abraham, and Ephron said unto Abraham, Behold all thou requirest thy servant will do; and Abraham said, No, but I will buy the cave and the field which thou hast for value, In order that it may be for a possession of a burial place for ever.</p> 
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And Ephron answered and said, Behold the field and the cave are before thee, give whatever thou desirest; and Abraham said, Only at full value will I buy it from thy hand, and from the hands of those that go in at the gate of thy city, and from the hand of thy seed forever.</p> 
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And Ephron and all his brethren heard this, and Abraham weighed to Ephron four hundred shekels of silver in the hands of Ephron and in the hands of all his brethren; and Abraham wrote this transaction, and he wrote it and testified it with four witnesses.</p> 
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And these are the names of the witnesses, Amigal son of Abishna the Hittite, Adichorom son of Ashunach the Hivite, Abdon son of Achiram the Gomerite, Bakdil the son of Abudish the Zidonite.</p> 
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And Abraham took the book of the purchase, and placed it in his treasures, and these are the words that Abraham wrote in the book, namely:</p> 
                    <p><sup>10</sup> That the cave and the field Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite, and from his seed, and from those that go out of his city, and from their seed for ever, are to be a purchase to Abraham and to his seed and to those that go forth from his loins, for a possession of a burial place for ever; and he put a signet to it and testified it with witnesses.</p> 
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And the field and the cave that was in it and all that place were made sure unto Abraham and unto his seed after him, from the children of Heth; behold it is before Mamre in Hebron, which is in the land of Canaan.</p> 
                    <p><sup>12</sup> And after this Abraham buried his wife Sarah there, and that place and all its boundary became to Abraham and unto his seed for a possession of a burial place.</p> 
                    <p><sup>13</sup> And Abraham buried Sarah with pomp as observed at the interment of kings, and she was buried in very fine and beautiful garments.</p> 
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And at her bier was Shem, his sons Eber and Abimelech, together with Anar, Ashcol and Mamre, and all the grandees of the land followed her bier.</p> 
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And the days of Sarah were one hundred and twenty-seven years and she died, and Abraham made a great and heavy mourning, and he performed the rites of mourning for seven days.</p> 
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And all the inhabitants of the land comforted Abraham and Isaac his son on account of Sarah.</p> 
                    <p><sup>17</sup> And when the days of their mourning passed by Abraham sent away his son Isaac, and he went to the house of Shem and Eber, to learn the ways of the Lord and his instructions, and Abraham remained there three years.</p> 
                    <p><sup>18</sup> At that time Abraham rose up with all his servants, and they went and returned homeward to Beersheba, and Abraham and all his servants remained in Beersheba.</p> 
                    <p><sup>19</sup> And at the revolution of the year Abimelech king of the Philistines died in that year; he was one hundred and ninety-three years old at his death; and Abraham went with his people to the land of the Philistines, and 
                    <p><sup>20</sup> And it was after the death of Abimelech that the people of Gerar took Benmalich his son, and he was only twelve years old, and they made him lying in the place of his father.</p> 
                    <p><sup>21</sup> And they called his name Abimelech after the name of his father, for thus was it their custom to do in Gerar, and Abimelech reigned instead of Abimelech his father, and he sat upon his throne.</p> 
                    <p><sup>22</sup> And Lot the son of Haran also died in those days, in the thirty-ninth year of the life of Isaac, and all the days that Lot lived were one hundred and forty years and he died.</p> 
                    <p><sup>23</sup> And these are the children of Lot, that were born to him by his daughters, the name of the first born was Moab, and the name of the second was Benami.</p> 
                    <p><sup>24</sup> And the two sons of Lot went and took themselves wives from the land of Canaan, and they bare children to them, and the children of Moab were Ed, Mayon, Tarsus, and Kanvil, four sons, these are fathers to the children of Moab unto this day.</p> 
                    <p><sup>25</sup> And all the families of the children of Lot went to dwell wherever they should light upon, for they were fruitful and increased abundantly.</p> 
                    <p><sup>26</sup> And they went and built themselves cities in the land where they dwelt, and they called the names of the cities which they built after their own names.</p> 
                    <p><sup>27</sup> And Nahor the son of Terah, brother to Abraham, died in those days in the fortieth year of the life of Isaac, and all the days of Nahor were one hundred and seventy-two years and he died and was buried in Haran.</p> 
                    <p><sup>28</sup> And when Abraham heard that his brother was dead he grieved sadly, and he mourned over his brother many days.</p> 
                    <p><sup>29</sup> And Abraham called for Eliezer his head servant, to give him orders concerning his house, and he came and stood before him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>30</sup> And Abraham said to him, Behold I am old, I do not know the day of my death; for I am advanced in days; now therefore rise up, go forth and do not take a wife for my son from this place and from this land, from the daughters of the Canaanites amongst whom we dwell.</p> 
                    <p><sup>31</sup> But go to my land and to my birthplace, and take from thence a wife for my son, and the Lord God of Heaven and earth who took me from my father's house and brought me to this place, and said unto me, To thy seed will I give this land for an inheritance for ever, he will send his angel before thee and prosper thy way, that thou mayest obtain a wife for my son from my family and from my father's house.</p> 
                    <p><sup>32</sup> And the servant answered his master Abraham and said, Behold I go to thy birthplace and to thy father's house, and take a wife for thy son from there; but if the woman be not willing to follow me to this land, shall I take thy son back to the land of thy birthplace?</p> 
                    <p><sup>33</sup> And Abraham said unto him, Take heed that thou bring not my son hither again, for the Lord before whom I have walked he will send his angel before thee and prosper thy way.</p> 
                    <p><sup>34</sup> And Eliezer did as Abraham ordered him, and Eliezer swore unto Abraham his master upon this matter; and Eliezer rose up and took ten camels of the camels of his master, and ten men from his master's servants with him, and they rose up and went to Haran, the city of Abraham and Nahor, in order to fetch a wife for Isaac the son of Abraham; and whilst they were gone Abraham sent to the house of Shem and Eber, and they brought from thence his son Isaac.</p> 
                    <p><sup>35</sup> And Isaac came home to his father's house to Beersheba, whilst Eliezer and his men came to Haran; and they stopped in the city by the watering place, and he made his camels to kneel down by the water and they remained there.</p> 
                    <p><sup>36</sup> And Eliezer, Abraham's servant, prayed and said, O God of Abraham my master; send me I pray thee good speed this day and show kindness unto my master, that thou shalt appoint this day a wife for my master's son from his family.</p> 
                    <p><sup>37</sup> And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Eliezer, for the sake of his servant Abraham, and he happened to meet with the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, brother to Abraham, and Eliezer came to her house.</p> 
                    <p><sup>38</sup> And Eliezer related to them all his concerns, and that he was Abraham's servant, and they greatly rejoiced at him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>39</sup> And they all blessed the Lord who brought this thing about, and they gave him Rebecca, the daughter of Bethuel, for a wife for Isaac.</p> 
                    <p><sup>40</sup> And the young woman was of very comely appearance, she was a virgin, and Rebecca was ten years old in those days.</p> 
                    <p><sup>41</sup> And Bethuel and Laban and his children made a feast on that night, and Eliezer and his men came and ate and drank and rejoiced there on that night.</p> 
                    <p><sup>42</sup> And Eliezer rose up in the morning, he and the men that were with him, and he called to the whole household of Bethuel, saying, Send me away that I may go to my master; and they rose up and sent away Rebecca and her nurse Deborah, the daughter of Uz, and they gave her silver and gold, men servants and maid servants, and they blessed her.</p> 
                    <p><sup>43</sup> And they sent Eliezer away with his men; and the servants took Rebecca, and he went and returned to his master to the land of Canaan.</p> 
                    <p><sup>44</sup> And Isaac took Rebecca and she became his wife, and he brought her into the tent.</p> 
                    <p><sup>45</sup> And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebecca, the daughter of his uncle Bethuel, for a wife.</p> 
                    
                    
                      
        <H2>Chapter 3</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Abraham takes Keturah for a Wife, by whom he has Six Sons. The Generations of the Sons of Keturah, and of Ishmael.</p>                
                    
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And it was at that time that Abraham again took a wife in his old age, and her name was Keturah, from the land of Canaan.</p> 
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And she bare unto him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuach, being six sons. And the children of Zimran were Abihen, Molich and Narim.</p>

                    <p><sup>7</sup> And all these went to the mountain at the east, and they built themselves six cities in which they dwelt unto this day.</p> 
                    <p><sup>8</sup> But the children of Sheba and Dedan, children of Jokshan, with their children, did not dwell with their brethren in their cities, and they journeyed and encamped in the countries and wildernesses unto this day.</p> 
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And the children of Midian, son of Abraham, went to the east of the land of Cush, and they there found a large valley in the eastern country, and they remained there and built a city, and they dwelt therein, that is the land of Midian unto this day.</p> 
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And Midian dwelt in the city which he built, he and his five sons and all belonging to him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And these are the names of the sons of Midian according to their names in their cities, Ephah, Epher, Chanoch, Abida and Eldaah.</p>

                    <p><sup>14</sup> And these are the generations of Ishmael the son Abraham, whom Hagar, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham.</p> 
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And Ishmael took a wife from the land of Egypt, and her name was Ribah, the same is Meribah.</p> 
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And Ribah bare unto Ishmael Nebayoth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam and their sister Bosmath.</p> 
                    <p><sup>17</sup> And Ishmael cast away his wife Ribah, and she went from him and returned to Egypt to the house of her father, and she dwelt there, for she had been very bad in the sight of Ishmael, and in the sight of his father Abraham.</p> 
                    <p><sup>18</sup> And Ishmael afterward took a wife from the land of Canaan, and her name was Malchuth, and she bare unto him Nishma, Dumah, Masa, Chadad, Tema, Yetur, Naphish and Kedma.</p> 
                    <p><sup>19</sup> These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, being twelve princes according to their nations; and the families of Ishmael afterward spread forth, and Ishmael took his children and all the property that he had gained, together with the souls of his household and all belonging to him, and they went to dwell where they should find a place.</p> 
                    <p><sup>20</sup> And they went and dwelt near the wilderness of Paran, and their dwelling was from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt as thou comest toward Assyria.</p> 
                    <p><sup>21</sup> And Ishmael and his sons dwelt in the land, and they had children born to them, and they were fruitful and increased abundantly.</p> 
                    <p><sup>22</sup> And these are the names of the sons of Nebayoth the first born of Ishmael; Mend, Send, Mayon; and the sons of Kedar were Alyon, Kezem, Chamad and Eli.</p>

                    <p><sup>28</sup> And Rebecca the daughter of Bethuel, the wife of Abraham's son Isaac, was barren in those days, she had no offspring; and Isaac dwelt with his father in the land of Canaan; and the Lord was with Isaac; and Arpachshad the son of Shem the son of Noah died in those days, in the forty-eighth year of the life of Isaac, and all the days that Arpachshad lived were four hundred and thirty-eight years, and he died.</p>
