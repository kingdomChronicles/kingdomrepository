<p class="chapterTitle">How to compute Jubilee years</p>
<p>
1 Jubilee  = 7 weeks <br>
1 Week     = 7 years <br>
1 Jubilee  = 49 years
</p>
<p>Sample Computation:</p>
<p>There are 49 Jubilees, 2 weeks and 2 years from Adam to the 40 days of Moses on Mt. Sinai.</p>
<p>
49 jubilees x 49 years / jubilee =    2401 years <br>
7 weeks x 7 years / week ----- =    49 years <br>
2 years------------------------- =     2  years 
</p>

<p>2,401 years + 49 years + 2 years = 2410 years from Adam to Mt Sinai when the Law was given to Moses </p>

            <p class="chapterTitle">
            Moses receives the tables of the law and instruction on past and future history which he is to inscribe in a book, 1-4. Apostasy of Israel,5-9. Captivity of Israel and Judah, 10-13.

Moses bidden to write down the future history of the world (the Book of Jubilees?), 26. And an angel to write down the law, 27. This angel takes the heavenly chronological tablets to dictate therefrom to Moses, 29. </p>
            
            <p class="chapterTitle">T<small>HIS</small> is the history of the division of the days of the law and of the testimony, of the events of the years, of their (year) weeks, of their Jubilees throughout all the years of the world, as the Lord spake to Moses on Mount Sinai when he went up to receive the tables of the law and of the commandment, according to the voice of God as he said unto him, 'Go up to the top of the Mount.'</p>

                <p><sup>1</sup> And it came to pass in the first year of the exodus of the children of Israel out of Egypt, in the third month, on the sixteenth day of the month, [2450 Anno Mundi] that God spake to Moses, saying: 'Come up to Me on the Mount, and I will give thee two tables of stone of the law and of the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayst teach them.'</p>   
                <p><sup>2</sup> And Moses went up into the mount of God, and the glory of the Lord abode on Mount Sinai, and a cloud  overshadowed it six days.</p>
                <p><sup>3</sup> And He called to Moses on the seventh day out of the midst of the cloud, and the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a flaming fire on the top of the mount.</p>
                <p><sup>4</sup> And Moses was on the Mount forty days and forty nights, and God taught him the earlier and the later  history of the division of all the days of the law and of the testimony.</p>
                <p><sup>5</sup> And He said: 'Incline thine heart to every word which I shall speak to thee on this mount, and write them in a book in order that their generations may see how I have not forsaken them for all the evil which they have wrought in transgressing the covenant which I establish between Me and thee for their generations this day on Mount Sinai.</p>
                <p><sup>6</sup> And thus it will come to pass when all these things come upon them, that they will recognise that I am more righteous than they in all their judgments and in all their actions, and they will recognise that I have been truly  with them. </p>
                <p><sup>7</sup> And do thou write for thyself all these words which I declare unto, thee this day, for I know their  rebellion and their stiff neck, before I bring them into the land of which I sware to their fathers, to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob, saying: ' Unto your seed will I give a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
                <p><sup>8</sup> And they will eat and be satisfied, and they will turn to strange gods, to (gods) which cannot deliver them from aught of their tribulation: and this witness shall be heard for a witness against them.  For they will forget all My commandments, (even) all that I command them, and they will walk after the Gentiles, and after their uncleanness, and after their shame, and will serve their gods, and these will prove unto them an offence and a tribulation and an affliction and a snare.</p>
                <p><sup>9</sup> And many will perish and they will be taken captive, and will fall into the hands of the enemy, because they have forsaken My ordinances and My commandments, and the festivals of My covenant, and My sabbaths, and My holy place which I have hallowed for Myself in their midst, and My tabernacle, and My sanctuary, which I have hallowed for Myself in the midst of the land, that I should set my name upon it, and that it should dwell (there).</p>
                <p><sup>10</sup> And they will make to themselves high places and groves and graven images, and they will worship, each his own (graven image), so as to go astray, and they will sacrifice their children to demons, and to all the works of the error of their hearts.</p>
                <p><sup>11</sup> And I will send witnesses unto them, that I may witness against them, but they will not hear, and will slay the witnesses also, and they will persecute those who seek the law, and they will abrogate and change everything so as to work evil before My eyes.</p>
                <p><sup>12</sup> And I will hide My face from them, and I will deliver them into the hand of the Gentiles for captivity, and for a prey, and for devouring, and I will remove them from the midst of the land, and I will scatter them amongst the Gentiles.</p>
                <p><sup>13</sup> And they will forget all My law and all My commandments and all My judgments, and will go astray as to new moons, and sabbaths, and festivals, and jubilees, and ordinances.</p>
                <p><sup>14</sup> And after this they will turn to Me from amongst the Gentiles with all their heart and with all their soul and with all their strength, and I will gather them from amongst all the Gentiles, and they will seek me, so that I shall be found of them, when they seek me with all their heart and with all their soul.</p>
                <p><sup>15</sup> And I will disclose to them abounding peace with righteousness, and I will remove them the plant of uprightness, with all My heart and with all My soul, and they shall be for a blessing and not for a curse, and they shall be the head and not the tail.</p>
                <p><sup>16</sup> And I will build My sanctuary in their midst, and I will dwell with them, and I will be their God and they shall be My people in truth and righteousness.</p>
                <p><sup>17</sup> And I will not forsake them nor fail them; for I am the Lord their God.'</p>
                <p><sup>18</sup> And Moses fell on his face and prayed and said, 'O Lord my God, do not forsake Thy people and Thy inheritance, so that they should wander in the error of their hearts, and do not deliver them into the hands of their enemies, the Gentiles, lest they should rule over them and cause them to sin against Thee.</p>
                <p><sup>19</sup> Let thy mercy, O Lord, be lifted up upon Thy people, and create in them an upright spirit, and let not the spirit of Beliar rule over them to accuse them before Thee, and to ensnare them from all the paths of righteousness, so that they may perish from before Thy face.</p>
                <p><sup>20</sup> But they are Thy people and Thy inheritance, which thou hast delivered with thy great power from the hands of the Egyptians: create in them a clean heart and a holy spirit, and let them not be ensnared in their sins from henceforth until eternity.'</p>
                <p><sup>21</sup> And the Lord said unto Moses:  'I know their contrariness and their thoughts and their stiffneckedness, and they will not be obedient till they confess their own sin and the sin of their fathers.</p>
                <p><sup>22</sup> And after this they will turn to Me in all uprightness and with all (their) heart and with all (their) soul, and I will circumcise the foreskin of their heart and the foreskin of the heart of their seed, and I will create in them a holy spirit, and I will cleanse them so that they shall not turn away from Me from that day unto eternity.</p>
                <p><sup>23</sup> And their souls will cleave to Me and to all My commandments, and they will fulfil My commandments, and I will be their Father and they shall be My children.</p>
                <p><sup>24</sup> And they all shall be called children of the living God, and every angel and every spirit shall know, yea, they shall know that these are My children, and that I am their Father in uprightness and righteousness, and that I love them.</p>
                <p><sup>25</sup> And do thou write down for thyself all these words which I declare unto thee on this mountain, the first and the last, which shall come to pass in all the divisions of the days in the law and in the testimony and in the weeks and the jubilees unto eternity, until I descend and dwell with them throughout eternity.'</p>
                <p><sup>26</sup> And He said to the angel of the presence: Write for Moses from the beginning of creation till My sanctuary has been built among them for all eternity.</p>
                <p><sup>27</sup> And the Lord will appear to the eyes of all, and all shall know that I am the God of Israel and the Father of all the children of Jacob, and King on Mount Zion for all eternity.  And Zion and Jerusalem shall be holy.' </p>
                <p><sup>28</sup> And the angel of the presence who went before the camp of Israel took the tables of the divisions of the years -from the time of the creation- of the law and of the testimony of the weeks of the jubilees, according to the individual years, according to all the number of the jubilees [according, to the individual years], from the day of the [new] creation when the heavens and the earth shall be renewed and all their creation according to the powers of the heaven, and according to all the creation of the earth, until the sanctuary of the Lord shall be made in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, and all the luminaries be renewed for healing and for peace and for blessing for all the elect of Israel, and that thus it may be from that day and unto all the days of the earth.</p>
                
    <H2>Chapter 2</H2>

            <p class="chapterTitle"> The history of the twenty-two distinct acts of creation on the six days, 1-16. Institution of the Sabbath: its observance by the highest angels, with whom Israel is afterwards to be associated, 17-32. (cf. Gen. i-ii. 3.)</p>

                <p><sup>1</sup> And the angel of the presence spake to Moses according to the word of the Lord, saying:  Write the complete history of the creation, how in six days the Lord God finished all His works and all that He created, and kept Sabbath on the seventh day and hallowed it for all ages, and appointed it as a sign for all His works.</p>           
                <p><sup>2</sup> For on the first day He created the heavens which are above and the earth and the waters and all the spirits which serve before him -the angels of the presence, and the angels of sanctification, and the angels [of the spirit of fire and the angels] of the spirit of the winds, and the angels of the spirit of the clouds, and of darkness, and of snow and of hail and of hoar frost, and the angels of the voices and of the thunder and of the lightning, and the angels of the spirits of cold and of heat, and of winter and of spring and of autumn and of summer and of all the spirits of his creatures which are in the heavens and on the earth, (He created) the abysses and the darkness, eventide &lt;and night&gt;, and the light, dawn and day, which He hath prepared in the knowledge of his heart.</p>           
                <p><sup>3</sup> And thereupon we saw His works, and praised Him, and lauded before Him on account of all His works; for seven great works did He create on the first day.</p>           
                <p><sup>4</sup> And on the second day He created the firmament in the midst of the waters, and the waters were divided on that day -half of them went up above and half of them went down below the firmament (that was) in the midst over the face of the whole earth. And this was the only work (God) created on the second day.</p>           
                <p><sup>5</sup> And on the third day He commanded the waters to pass from off the face of the whole earth into one place, and the dry land to appear.</p>           
                <p><sup>6</sup> And the waters did so as He commanded them, and they retired from off the face of the earth into one place outside of this firmament, and the dry land appeared.</p>           
                <p><sup>7</sup> And on that day He created for them all the seas according to their separate gathering-places, and all the rivers, and the gatherings of the waters in the mountains and on all the earth, and all the lakes, and all the dew of the earth, and the seed which is sown, and all sprouting things, and fruit-bearing trees, and trees of the wood, and the garden of Eden, in Eden and all <em>plants after their kind</em>.</p>           
                <p><sup>8</sup> These four great works God created on the third day. And on the fourth day He created the sun and the moon and the stars, and set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon all the earth, and to rule over the day and the night, and divide the light from the darkness.</p>           
                <p><sup>9</sup> And God appointed the sun to be a great sign on the earth for days and for sabbaths and for months and for feasts and for years and for sabbaths of years and for jubilees and for all seasons of the years.</p>           
                <p><sup>10</sup> And it divideth the light from the darkness [and] for prosperity, that all things may prosper which shoot and grow on the earth.</p>           
                <p><sup>11</sup> These three kinds He made on the fourth day.  And on the fifth day He created great sea monsters in the depths of the waters, for these were the first things of flesh that were created by his hands, the fish and everything that moves in the waters, and everything that flies, the birds and all their kind.</p>           
                <p><sup>12</sup> And the sun rose above them to prosper (them), and above everything that was on the earth, everything that shoots out of the earth, and all fruit-bearing trees, and all flesh.</p>           
                <p><sup>13</sup> These three kinds He created on the fifth day.  And on the sixth day He created all the animals of the earth, and all cattle, and everything that moves on the earth.</p>           
                <p><sup>14</sup> And after all this He created man, a man and a woman created He them, and gave him dominion over all that is upon the earth, and in the seas, and over everything that flies, and over beasts and over cattle, and over everything that moves on the earth, and over the whole earth, and over all this He gave him dominion.</p>           
                <p><sup>15</sup> And these four kinds He created on the sixth day.  And there were altogether two and twenty kinds.</p>           
                <p><sup>16</sup> And He finished all his work on the sixth day -all that is in the heavens and on the earth, and in the seas and in the abysses, and in the light and in the darkness, and in everything.</p>           
                <p><sup>17</sup> And He gave us a great sign, the Sabbath day, that we should work six days, but keep Sabbath on the seventh day from all work.</p>           
                <p><sup>18</sup> And all the angels of the presence, and all the angels of sanctification, these two great classes -He hath bidden us to keep the Sabbath with Him in heaven and on earth.</p>           
                <p><sup>19</sup> And He said unto us:  'Behold, I will separate unto Myself a people from among all the peoples, and these shall keep the Sabbath day, and I will sanctify them unto Myself as My people, and will bless them; as I have sanctified the Sabbath day and do sanctify (it) unto Myself, even so will I bless them, and they shall be My people and I will be their God.</p>           
                <p><sup>20</sup> And I have chosen the seed of Jacob from amongst all that I have seen, and have written him down as My first-born son,and have sanctified him unto Myself for ever and ever; and I will teach them the Sabbath day, that they may keep Sabbath thereon from all work.'</p>           
                <p><sup>21</sup> And thus He created therein a sign in accordance with which they should keep Sabbath with us on the seventh day, to eat and to drink, and to bless Him who has created all things as He has blessed and sanctified unto Himself a peculiar people above all peoples, and that they should keep Sabbath together with us.</p>           
                <p><sup>22</sup> And He caused His commands to ascend as a sweet savour acceptable before Him all the days . . .</p>           
                <p><sup>23</sup> There (were) two and twenty heads of mankind from Adam to Jacob, and two and twenty kinds of work were made until the seventh day; this is blessed and holy; and the former also is blessed and holy; and this one serves with that one for sanctification and blessing.</p>           
                <p><sup>24</sup> And to this (Jacob and his seed) it was granted that they should always be the blessed and holy ones of the first testimony and law, even as He had sanctified and blessed the Sabbath day on the seventh day.</p>           
                <p><sup>25</sup> He created heaven and earth and everything that He created in six days, and God made the seventh day holy, for all His works; therefore He commanded on its behalf that, whoever does any work thereon shall die, and that he who defiles it shall surely die.</p>           
                <p><sup>26</sup> Wherefore do thou command the children of Israel to observe this day that they may keep it holy and not do thereon any work, and not to defile it, as it is holier than all other days.</p>           
                <p><sup>27</sup> And whoever profanes it shall surely die, and whoever does thereon any work shall surely die eternally, that the children of Israel may observe this day throughout their generations, and not be rooted out of the land; for it is a holy day and a blessed day.</p>           
                <p><sup>28</sup> And every one who observes it and keeps Sabbath thereon from all his work, will be holy and blessed throughout all days like unto us.</p>           
                <p><sup>29</sup> Declare and say to the children of Israel the law of this day both that they should keep Sabbath thereon, and that they should not forsake it in the error of their hearts; (and) that it is not lawful to do any work thereon which is unseemly, to do thereon their own pleasure, and that they should not prepare thereon anything to be eaten or drunk, and (that it is not lawful) to draw water, or bring in or take out thereon through their gates any burden, which they had not prepared for themselves on the sixth day in their dwellings.</p>           
                <p><sup>30</sup> And they shall not bring in nor take out from house to house on that day; for that day is more holy and blessed than any jubilee day of the jubilees; on this we kept Sabbath in the heavens before it was made known to any flesh to keep Sabbath thereon on the earth.</p>           
                <p><sup>31</sup> And the Creator of all things blessed it, but he did not sanctify all peoples and nations to keep Sabbath thereon, but Israel alone: them alone he permitted to eat and drink and to keep Sabbath thereon on the earth.</p>           
                <p><sup>32</sup> And the Creator of all things blessed this day which He had created for blessing and holiness and glory above all days.</p>           
                <p><sup>33</sup> This law and testimony was given to the children of Israel as a law for ever unto their generations.</p>           


    <H2>Chapter 3</H2>

          <p class="chapterTitle"> Adam names all creatures, 1-3. Creaton of Eve and enactment of Levitical laws of purification, 4-14. Adam and Eve in Paradise: their sin and expulsion, 15-29. Law of covering one's shame enacted, 30-32. Adam and Eve live in &Ecirc;ld&acirc;, 32-35. (Cf.Gen. ii.18-25, iii.)</p>
    
                <p><sup>1</sup> And on the six days of the second week we brought, according to the word of God, unto Adam all the beasts, and all the cattle, and all the birds, and everything that moves on the earth, and everything that moves in the water, according to their kinds, and according to their types:  the beasts on the first day; the cattle on the second day; the birds on the third day; and all that which moves on the earth on the fourth day; and that which moves in the water on the fifth day.</p> 
                <p><sup>2</sup> And Adam named them all by their respective names, and as he called them, so was their name.</p> 
                <p><sup>3</sup> And on these five days Adam saw all these, male and female, according to every kind that was on the earth, but he was alone and found no helpmeet for him.</p> 
                <p><sup>4</sup> And the Lord said unto us: 'It is not good that the man should be alone:  let us make a helpmeet for him.'</p> 
                <p><sup>5</sup> And the Lord our God caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and he slept, and He took for the woman one rib from amongst his ribs, and this rib was the origin of the woman from amongst his ribs, and He built up the flesh in its stead, and built the woman.</p> 
                <p><sup>6</sup> And He awaked Adam out of his sleep and on awaking he rose on the sixth day, and He brought her to him, and he knew her, and said unto her: 'This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called [my] wife; because she was taken from her husband.'</p> 
                <p><sup>7</sup> Therefore shall man and wife be one and therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.</p> 
                <p><sup>8</sup> In the first week was Adam created, and the rib -his wife:  in the second week He showed her unto him:  and for this reason the commandment was given to keep in their defilement, for a male seven days, and for a female twice seven days.</p> 
                <p><sup>9</sup> And after Adam had completed forty days in the land where he had been created, we brought him into the garden of Eden to till and keep it, but his wife they brought in on the eightieth day, and after this she entered into the garden of Eden.</p> 
                <p><sup>10</sup> And for this reason the commandment is written on the heavenly tablets in regard to her that gives birth:  'if she bears a male, she shall remain in her uncleanness seven days according to the first week of days, and thirty and three days shall she remain in the blood of her purifying, and she shall not touch any hallowed thing, nor enter into the sanctuary, until she accomplishes these days which (are enjoined) in the case of a male child.</p> 
                <p><sup>11</sup> But in the case of a female child she shall remain in her uncleanness two weeks of days, according to the first two weeks, and sixty-six days in the blood of her purification, and they will be in all eighty days.'</p> 
                <p><sup>12</sup> And when she had completed these eighty days we brought her into the garden of Eden, for it is holier than all the earth besides and every tree that is planted in it is holy.</p> 
                <p><sup>13</sup> Therefore, there was ordained regarding her who bears a male or a female child the statute of those days that she should touch no hallowed thing, nor enter into the sanctuary until these days for the male or female child are accomplished.</p> 
                <p><sup>14</sup> This is the law and testimony which was written down for Israel, in order that they should observe (it) all the days.</p> 
                <p><sup>15</sup> And in the first week of the first jubilee, [1-7 A.M.] Adam and his wife were in the garden of Eden for seven years tilling and keeping it, and we gave him work and we instructed him to do everything that is suitable for tillage.</p> 
                <p><sup>16</sup> And he tilled (the garden), and was naked and knew it not, and was not ashamed, and he protected the garden from the birds and beasts and cattle, and gathered its fruit, and eat, and put aside the residue for himself and for his wife [and put aside that which was being kept].</p> 
                <p><sup>17</sup> And after the completion of the seven years, which he had completed there, seven years exactly, [8 A.M.] and in the second month, on the seventeenth day (of the month), the serpent came and approached the woman, and the serpent said to the woman, 'Hath God commanded you, saying, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?' </p> 
                <p><sup>18</sup> And she said to it, 'Of all the fruit of the trees of the garden God hath said unto us, Eat; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said unto us, Ye shall not eat thereof, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.'</p> 
                <p><sup>19</sup> And the serpent said unto the woman, 'Ye shall not surely die:  for God doth know that on the day ye shall eat thereof, your eyes will be opened, and ye will be as gods, and ye will know good and evil.</p> 
                <p><sup>20</sup> And the woman saw the tree that it was agreeable and pleasant to the eye, and that its fruit was good for food, and she took thereof and eat.</p> 
                <p><sup>21</sup> And when she had first covered her shame with figleaves, she gave thereof to Adam and he eat, and his eyes were opened, and he saw that he was naked.</p> 
                <p><sup>22</sup> And he took figleaves and sewed (them) together, and made an apron for himself, and ,covered his shame.</p> 
                <p><sup>23</sup> And God cursed the serpent, and was wroth with it for ever . . .</p> 
                <p><sup>24</sup> And He was wroth with the woman, because she harkened to the voice of the serpent, and did eat; and He said unto her:  'I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy pains:  in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children, and thy return shall be unto thy husband, and he will rule over thee.'</p> 
                <p><sup>25</sup> And to Adam also he said, ' Because thou hast harkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat thereof, cursed be the ground for thy sake:  thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat thy bread in the sweat of thy face, till thou returnest to the earth from whence thou wast taken; for earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return.'</p> 
                <p><sup>26</sup> And He made for them coats of skin, and clothed them, and sent them forth from the Garden of Eden.</p> 
                <p><sup>27</sup> And on that day on which Adam went forth from the Garden, he offered as a sweet savour an offering, frankincense, galbanum, and stacte, and spices in the morning with the rising of the sun from the day when he covered his shame.</p> 
                <p><sup>28</sup> And on that day was closed the mouth of all beasts, and of cattle, and of birds, and of whatever walks, and of whatever moves, so that they could no longer speak:  for they had all spoken one with another with one lip and with one tongue.</p> 
                <p><sup>29</sup> And He sent out of the Garden of Eden all flesh that was in the Garden of Eden, and all flesh was scattered according to its kinds, and according to its types unto the places which had been created for them.</p> 
                <p><sup>30</sup> And to Adam alone did He give (the wherewithal) to cover his shame, of all the beasts and cattle.</p> 
                <p><sup>31</sup> On this account, it is prescribed on the heavenly tablets as touching all those who know the judgment of the law, that they should cover their shame, and should not uncover themselves as the Gentiles uncover themselves.</p> 
                <p><sup>32</sup> And on the new moon of the fourth month, Adam and his wife went forth from the Garden of Eden, and they dwelt in the land of Elda in the land of their creation.</p> 
                <p><sup>33</sup> And Adam called the name of his wife Eve.</p> 
                <p><sup>34</sup> And they had no son till the first jubilee, [8 A.M.] and after this he knew her.</p> 
                <p><sup>35</sup> Now he tilled the land as he had been instructed in the Garden of Eden.</p>
