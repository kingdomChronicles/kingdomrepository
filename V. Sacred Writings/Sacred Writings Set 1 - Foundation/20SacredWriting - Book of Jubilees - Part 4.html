<p class="chapterTitle">How to compute Jubilee years</p>
<p>
1 Jubilee  = 7 weeks <br>
1 Week     = 7 years <br>
1 Jubilee  = 49 years
</p>
<p>Sample Computation:</p>
<p>There are 49 Jubilees, 2 weeks and 2 years from Adam to the 40 days of Moses on Mt. Sinai.</p>
<p>
49 jubilees x 49 years / jubilee =    2401 years <br>
7 weeks x 7 years / week ----- =    49 years <br>
2 years------------------------- =     2  years 
</p>

<p>2,401 years + 49 years + 2 years = 2410 years from Adam to Mt Sinai when the Law was given to Moses </p>

    <H2>Chapter 1</H2>

          <p class="chapterTitle"> K&acirc;in&acirc;m discovers an inscription relating to the sun and stars, 1-4. His sons, 5-8. Noah's sons and Noah divide the earth, 10-11. Shem's inheritance, 12-21: Ham's, 22-24: Japheth's, 25-30. (Cf. Gen. x.)</p>
                
                <p><sup>1</sup> In the twenty-ninth jubilee, in the first week, [1373 A.M.] in the beginning thereof Arpachshad took to himself a wife and her name was Rasu'eja, the daughter of Susan, the daughter of Elam, and she bare him a son in the third year in this week, [1375 A.M.] and he called his name Kainam.</p> 
                <p><sup>2</sup> And the son grew, and his father taught him writing, and he went to seek for himself a place where he might seize for himself a city.</p> 
                <p><sup>3</sup> And he found a writing which former (generations) had carved on the rock, and he read what was thereon, and he transcribed it and sinned owing to it; for it contained the teaching of the Watchers in accordance with which they used to observe the omens of the sun and moon and stars in all the signs of heaven.</p> 
                <p><sup>4</sup> And he wrote it down and said nothing regarding it; for he was afraid to speak to Noah about it lest he should be angry with him on account of it.</p> 
                <p><sup>5</sup> And in the thirtieth jubilee, [1429 A.M.] in the second week, in the first year thereof, he took to himself a wife, and her name was Melka, the daughter of Madai, the son of Japheth, and in the fourth year [1432 A.M.] he begat a son, and called his name Shelah; for he said:  'Truly I have been sent.'</p> 
                <p><sup>6</sup> [And in the fourth year he was born], and Shelah grew up and took to himself a wife, and her name was Mu'ak, the daughter of Kesed, his father's brother, in the one and thirtieth jubilee, in the fifth week, in the first year [1499 A.M.] thereof.</p> 
                <p><sup>7</sup> And she bare him a son in the fifth year [1503 A.M.] thereof, and he called his name Eber:  and he took unto himself a wife, and her name was 'Az&ucirc;r&acirc;d, the daughter of Nebrod, in the thirty-second jubilee, in the seventh week, in the third year thereof. [1564 A.M.]</p> 
                <p><sup>8</sup> And in the sixth year [1567 A.M.] thereof, she bare him  son, and he called his name Peleg; for in the days when he was born the children of Noah began to divide the earth amongst themselves:  for this reason he called his name Peleg.</p> 
                <p><sup>9</sup> And they divided (it) secretly amongst themselves, and told it to Noah.</p> 
                <p><sup>10</sup> And it came to pass in the beginning of the thirty-third jubilee [1569 A.M.] that they divided the earth into three parts, for Shem and Ham and Japheth, according to the inheritance of each, in the first year in the first week, when one of us who had been sent, was with them.</p> 
                <p><sup>11</sup> And he called his sons, and they drew nigh to him, they and their children, and he divided the earth into the lots, which his three sons were to take in possession, and they reached forth their hands, and took the writing out of the bosom of Noah, their father.</p> 
                <p><sup>12</sup> And there came forth on the writing as Shem's lot the middle of the earth which he should take as an inheritance for himself and for his sons for the generations of eternity, from the middle of the mountain range of Rafa, from the mouth of the water from the river Tina, and his portion goes towards the west through the midst of this river, and it extends till it reaches the water of the abysses, out of which this river goes forth and pours its waters into the sea Me'at, and this river flows into the great sea.  And all that is towards the north is Japheth's, and all that is towards the south belongs to Shem.</p> 
                <p><sup>13</sup> And it extends till it reaches Karaso:  this is in the bosom of the tongue which looks towards the south.</p> 
                <p><sup>14</sup> And his portion extends along the great sea, and it extends in a straight line till it reaches the west of the tongue which looks towards the south: for this sea is named the tongue of the Egyptian Sea.</p> 
                <p><sup>15</sup> And it turns from here towards the south towards the mouth of the great sea on the shore of (its) waters, and it extends to the west to 'Afra, and it extends till it reaches the waters of the river Gihon, and to the south of the waters of Gihon, to the banks of this river.</p> 
                <p><sup>16</sup> And it extends towards the east, till it reaches the Garden of Eden, to the south thereof, [to the south] and from the east of the whole land of Eden and of the whole east, it turns to the east and proceeds till it reaches the east of the mountain named Rafa, and it descends to the bank of the mouth of the river Tina.</p> 
                <p><sup>17</sup> This portion came forth by lot for Shem and his sons, that they should possess it for ever unto his generations for evermore.</p> 
                <p><sup>18</sup> And Noah rejoiced that this portion came forth for Shem and for his sons, and he remembered all that he had spoken with his mouth in prophecy; for he had said: 'Blessed be the Lord God of Shem And may the Lord dwell in the dwelling of Shem.'</p> 
                <p><sup>19</sup> And he knew that the Garden of Eden is the holy of holies, and the dwelling of the Lord, and Mount Sinai the centre of the desert, and Mount Zion -the centre of the navel of the earth:  these three were created as holy places facing each other.</p> 
                <p><sup>20</sup> And he blessed the God of gods, who had put the word of the Lord into his mouth, and the Lord for evermore.</p> 
                <p><sup>21</sup> And he knew that a blessed portion and a blessing had come to Shem and his sons unto the generations for ever -the whole land of Eden and the whole land of the Red Sea, and the whole land of the east and India, and on the Red Sea and the mountains thereof, and all the land of Bashan, and all the land of Lebanon and the islands of Kaftur, and all the mountains of Sanir and 'Amana, and the mountains of Asshur in the north, and all the land of Elam, Asshur, and Babel, and Susan and Ma'edai, and all the mountains of Ararat, and all the region beyond the sea, which is beyond the mountains of Asshur towards the north, a blessed and spacious land, and all that is in it is very good.</p> 
                <p><sup>22</sup> And for Ham came forth the second portion, beyond the Gihon towards the south to the right of the Garden, and it extends towards the south and it extends to all the mountains of fire, and it extends towards the west to the sea of 'Atel and it extends towards the west till it reaches the sea of Ma'uk -that (sea) into which everything which is not destroyed descends.</p> 
                <p><sup>23</sup> And it goes forth towards the north to the limits of Gadir, and it goes forth to the coast of the waters of the sea to the waters of the great sea till it draws near to the river Gihon, and goes along the river Gihon till it reaches the right of the Garden of Eden.</p> 
                <p><sup>24</sup> And this is the land which came forth for Ham as the portion which he was to occupy for ever for himself and his sons unto their generations for ever.</p> 
                <p><sup>25</sup> And for Japheth came forth the third portion beyond the river Tina to the north of the outflow of its waters, and it extends north- easterly to the whole region of Gog, and to all the country east thereof.</p> 
                <p><sup>26</sup> And it extends northerly to the north, and it extends to the mountains of Qelt towards the north, and towards the sea of Ma'uk, and it goes forth to the east of Gadir as far as the region of the waters of the sea.</p> 
                <p><sup>27</sup> And it extends until it approaches the west of Fara and it returns towards 'Aferag, and it extends easterly to the waters of the sea of Me'at.</p> 
                <p><sup>28</sup> And it extends to the region of the river Tina in a north-easterly direction until it approaches the boundary of its waters towards the mountain Rafa, and it turns round towards the north.</p> 
                <p><sup>29</sup> This is the land which came forth for Japheth and his sons as the portion of his inheritance which he should possess for himself and his sons, for their generations for ever; five great islands, and a great land in the north.</p> 
                <p><sup>30</sup> But it is cold, and the land of Ham is hot, and the land of Shem is neither hot nor cold, but it is of blended cold and heat.</p> 

    <H2>Chapter 2</H2>

          <p class="chapterTitle"> Subdivision of the three portions amongst the grandchildren of Noah. Amongst Ham's children, 1:
            Shem's, 2-6: Japheth's, 7-13. Oath taken by Noah's sons, 14-15.</p>
                      
                <p><sup>1</sup> And Ham divided amongst his sons, and the first portion came forth for Cush towards the east, and to the west of him for Mizraim, and to the west of him for Put, and to the west of him [and to the west thereof] on the sea for Canaan.</p> 
                <p><sup>2</sup> And Shem also divided amongst his sons, and the first portion came forth for Ham and his sons, to the east of the river Tigris till it approaches the east, the whole land of India, and on the Red Sea on its coast, and the waters of Dedan, and all the mountains of Mebri and Ela, and all the land of Susan and all that is on the side of Pharnak to the Red Sea and the river Tina.</p> 
                <p><sup>3</sup> And for Asshur came forth the second Portion, all the land of Asshur and Nineveh and Shinar and to the border of India, and it ascends and skirts the river.</p> 
                <p><sup>4</sup> And for Arpachshad came forth the third portion, all the land of the region of the Chaldees to the east of the Euphrates, bordering on the Red Sea, and all the waters of the desert close to the tongue of the sea which looks towards Egypt, all the land of Lebanon and Sanir and 'Amana to the border of the Euphrates.</p> 
                <p><sup>5</sup> And for Aram there came forth the fourth portion, all the land of Mesopotamia between the Tigris and the Euphrates to the north of the Chaldees to the border of the mountains of Asshur and the land of 'Arara.</p> 
                <p><sup>6</sup> And there came forth for Lud the fifth portion, the mountains of Asshur and all appertaining to them till it reaches the Great Sea, and till it reaches the east of Asshur his brother.</p> 
                <p><sup>7</sup> And Japheth also divided the land of his inheritance amongst his sons.</p> 
                <p><sup>8</sup> And the first portion came forth for Gomer to the east from the north side to the river Tina; and in the north there came forth for Magog all the inner portions of the north until it reaches to the sea of Me'at.</p> 
                <p><sup>9</sup> And for Madai came forth as his portion that he should posses from the west of his two brothers to the islands, and to the coasts of the islands.</p> 
                <p><sup>10</sup> And for Javan came forth the fourth portion every island and the islands which are towards the border of Lud.</p> 
                <p><sup>11</sup> And for Tubal there came forth the fifth portion in the midst of the tongue which approaches towards the
                  border of the portion of Lud to the second tongue, to the region beyond the second tongue unto the third tongue.</p> 
                <p><sup>12</sup> And for Meshech came forth the sixth portion, all the region beyond the third tongue till it approaches the east of Gadir.</p> 
                <p><sup>13</sup> And for Tiras there came forth the seventh portion, four great islands in the midst of the sea, which reach to the portion of Ham [and the islands of Kamaturi came out by lot for the sons of Arpachshad as his inheritance].</p> 
                <p><sup>14</sup> And thus the sons of Noah divided unto their sons in the presence of Noah their father, and he bound them all by an oath, imprecating a curse on every one that sought to seize the portion which had not fallen (to him) by his lot.</p> 
                <p><sup>15</sup> And they all said, 'So be it; so be it ' for themselves and their sons for ever throughout their generations till the day of judgment, on which the Lord God shall judge them with a sword and with fire for all the unclean wickedness of their errors, wherewith they have filled the earth with transgression and uncleanness and fornication and sin.</p> 

    <H2>Chapter 3</H2>

          <p class="chapterTitle"> Evil spirits leads astray the sons of Noah, 1-2. Noah's prayer, 3-6. Mast&ecirc;m&acirc; allowed to retain one-tenth of his subject spirits, 7-11. Noah taught the use of herbs by the angels for resisting the demons, 12-14. Noah dies, 15-17. Building of Babel and the confusion of tongues, 18-27. Canaan seizes on Palestine, 29-34. Madai receives Media, 33-36.</p>
                            
                <p><sup>1</sup> And in the third week of this jubilee the unclean demons began to lead astray the children of the sons of Noah, and to make to err and destroy them.</p> 
                <p><sup>2</sup> And the sons of Noah came to Noah their father, and they told him concerning the demons which were leading astray and blinding and slaying his sons' sons.</p> 
                <p><sup>3</sup> And he prayed before the Lord his God, and said:  <BR><BR>
           
                       'God of the spirits of all flesh, who hast shown mercy unto me <BR>
                       And hast saved me and my sons from the waters of the flood,<BR>
                       And hast not caused me to perish as Thou didst the sons of perdition;<P>
                       
                       For Thy grace has been great towards me,<BR>
                       And great has been Thy mercy to my soul;<BR><BR>
                  
                       Let Thy grace be lift up upon my sons, <BR>
                       And let not wicked spirits rule over them<BR>
                       Lest they should destroy them from the earth.</p> 
                <p><sup>4</sup> But do Thou bless me and my sons, that we may increase and multiply and replenish the earth.</p> 
                <p><sup>5</sup> And Thou knowest how Thy Watchers, the fathers of these spirits, acted in my day: and as for these spirits which are living, imprison them and hold them fast in the place of condemnation, and let them not bring destruction on the sons of thy servant, my God; for these are malignant, and created in order to destroy.</p> 
                <p><sup>6</sup> And let them not rule over the spirits of the living; for Thou alone canst exercise dominion over them.  And let them not have power over the sons of the righteous from henceforth and for evermore.'</p> 
                <p><sup>7</sup> And the Lord our God bade us to bind all.</p> 
                <p><sup>8</sup> And the chief of the spirits, Mast&ecirc;m&acirc;, came and said:  'Lord, Creator, let some of them remain before me, and let them harken to my voice, and do all that I shall say unto them; for if some of them are not left to me, I shall not be able to execute the power of my will on the sons of men; for these are for corruption and leading astray before my judgment, for great is the wickedness of the sons of men.'</p> 
                <p><sup>9</sup> And He said:  Let the tenth part of them remain before him, and let nine parts descend into the place of condemnation.'</p> 
                <p><sup>10</sup> And one of us He commanded that we should teach Noah all their medicines; for He knew that they would not walk in uprightness, nor strive in righteousness.</p> 
                <p><sup>11</sup> And we did according to all His words:  all the malignant evil ones we bound in the place of condemnation and a tenth part of them we left that they might be subject before Satan on the earth.</p> 
                <p><sup>12</sup> And we explained to Noah all the medicines of their diseases, together with their seductions, how he might heal them with herbs of the earth.</p> 
                <p><sup>13</sup> And Noah wrote down all things in a book as we instructed him concerning every kind of medicine.  Thus the evil spirits were precluded from (hurting) the sons of Noah.</p> 
                <p><sup>14</sup> And he gave all that he had written to Shem, his eldest son; for he loved him exceedingly above all his sons.</p> 
                <p><sup>15</sup> And Noah slept with his fathers, and was buried on Mount Lubar in the land of Ararat. </p> 
                <p><sup>16</sup> Nine hundred and fifty years he completed in his life, nineteen jubilees and two weeks and five years. [1659 A.M.]</p> 
                <p><sup>17</sup> And in his life on earth he excelled the children of men save Enoch because of the righteousness, wherein he was perfect.  For Enoch's office was ordained for a testimony to the generations of the world, so that he should recount all the deeds of generation unto generation, till the day of judgment.</p> 
                <p><sup>18</sup> And in the three and thirtieth jubilee, in the first year in the second week, Peleg took to himself a wife, whose name was Lomna the daughter of Sina'ar, and she bare him a son in the fourth year of this week, and he called his name Reu; for he said:  'Behold the children of men have become evil through the wicked purpose of building for themselves a city and a tower in the land of Shinar.'</p> 
                <p><sup>19</sup> For they departed from the land of Ararat eastward to Shinar; for in his days they built the city and the tower, saying, 'Go to, let us ascend thereby into heaven.'</p> 
                <p><sup>20</sup> And they began to build, and in the fourth week they made brick with fire, and the bricks served them for stone, and the clay with which they cemented them together was asphalt which comes out of the sea, and out of the fountains of water in the land of Shinar.</p> 
                <p><sup>21</sup> And they built it:  forty and three years [1645-1688 A.M.] were they building it; its breadth was 203 bricks, and the height (of a brick) was the third of one; its height amounted to 5433 cubits and 2 palms, and (the extent of one wall was) thirteen stades (and of the other thirty stades).</p> 
                <p><sup>22</sup> And the Lord our God said unto us:  Behold, they are one people, and (this) they begin to do, and now nothing will be withholden from them.  Go to, let us go down and confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech, and they may be dispersed into cities and nations, and one purpose will no longer abide with them till the day of judgment.'</p> 
                <p><sup>23</sup> And the Lord descended, and we descended with him to see the city and the tower which the children of men had built.</p> 
                <p><sup>24</sup> And he confounded their language, and they no longer understood one another's speech, and they ceased then to build the city and the tower.</p> 
                <p><sup>25</sup> For this reason the whole land of Shinar is called Babel, because the Lord did there confound all the language of the children of men, and from thence they were dispersed into their cities, each according to his language and his nation.</p> 
                <p><sup>26</sup> And the Lord sent a mighty wind against the tower and overthrew it upon the earth, and behold it was between Asshur and Babylon in the land of Shinar, and they called its name 'Overthrow'.</p> 
                <p><sup>27</sup> In the fourth week in the first year [1688 A.M.] in the beginning thereof in the four and thirtieth jubilee, were they dispersed from the land of Shinar.</p> 
                <p><sup>28</sup> And Ham and his sons went into the land which he was to occupy, which he acquired as his portion in the land of the south.</p> 
                <p><sup>29</sup> And Canaan saw the land of Lebanon to the river of Egypt, that it was very good, and he went not into the land of his inheritance to the west (that is to) the sea, and he dwelt in the land of Lebanon, eastward and westward from the border of Jordan and from the border of the sea.</p> 
                <p><sup>30</sup> And Ham, his father, and Cush and Mizraim his brothers said unto him: 'Thou hast settled in a land which is not thine, and which did not fall to us by lot:  do not do so; for if thou dost do so, thou and thy sons will fall in the land and (be) accursed through sedition; for by sedition ye have settled, and by sedition will thy children fall, and thou shalt be rooted out for ever.</p> 
                <p><sup>31</sup> Dwell not in the dwelling of Shem; for to Shem and to his sons did it come by their lot.</p> 
                <p><sup>32</sup> Cursed art thou, and cursed shalt thou be beyond all the sons of Noah, by the curse by which we bound ourselves by an oath in the presence of the holy judge, and in the presence of Noah our father.'</p> 
                <p><sup>33</sup> But he did not harken unto them, and dwelt in the land of Lebanon from Hamath to the entering of Egypt, he and his sons until this day.</p> 
                <p><sup>34</sup> And for this reason that land is named Canaan.</p> 
                <p><sup>35</sup> And Japheth and his sons went towards the sea and dwelt in the land of their portion, and Madai saw the land of the sea and it did not please him, and he begged a (portion) from Ham and Asshur and Arpachshad, his wife's brother, and he dwelt in the land of Media, near to his wife's brother until this day.</p> 
                <p><sup>36</sup> And he called his dwelling-place, and the dwelling-place of his sons, Media, after the name of their father Madai.</p>
