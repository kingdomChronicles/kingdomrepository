<p class="chapterTitle">How to compute Jubilee years</p>
<p>
1 Jubilee  = 7 weeks <br>
1 Week     = 7 years <br>
1 Jubilee  = 49 years
</p>
<p>Sample Computation:</p>
<p>There are 49 Jubilees, 2 weeks and 2 years from Adam to the 40 days of Moses on Mt. Sinai.</p>
<p>
49 jubilees x 49 years / jubilee =    2401 years <br>
7 weeks x 7 years / week ----- =    49 years <br>
2 years------------------------- =     2  years 
</p>

<p>2,401 years + 49 years + 2 years = 2410 years from Adam to Mt Sinai when the Law was given to Moses </p>

    <H2>Chapter 1</H2>

            <p class="chapterTitle"> Abram receives the promise of a son and of innumerable descendants, 1-7. Offers a sacrifice and is told of his seed being in Egypt, 8-17. God's convenant with Abram, 18-20. Hagar bears Ishmael, 21-24. (Cf. Gen. xv.; xvi.1-4, 11.)</p>

                        
                <p><sup>1</sup>After these things, in the fourth year of this week, on the new moon of the third month, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a dream, saying:  'Fear not, Abram; I am thy defender, and thy reward will be exceeding great.' </p> 
                <p><sup>2</sup>And he said:  'Lord, Lord, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go hence childless, and the son of Maseq, the son of my handmaid, is the Dammasek Eliezer: he will be my heir, and to me thou hast given no seed.' </p> 
                <p><sup>3</sup>And he said unto him:  'This (man) will not be thy heir, but one that will come out of thine own bowels; he will be thine heir.'</p> 
                <p><sup>4</sup>And He brought him forth abroad, and said unto him:  'Look toward heaven and number the stars if thou art able to number them.'</p> 
                <p><sup>5</sup>And he looked toward heaven, and beheld the stars. And He said unto him:  'So shall thy seed be.' </p> 
                <p><sup>6</sup>And he believed in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteousness. </p> 
                <p><sup>7</sup>And He said unto him:  'I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee the land of the Canaanites to possess it for ever; and I will be God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.' </p> 
                <p><sup>8</sup>And he said:  'Lord, Lord, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit (it)?'     </p> 
                <p><sup>9</sup>And He said unto him:  'Take Me an heifer of three years, and a goat of three years, and a sheep of three years, and a turtle-dove, and a pigeon.' </p> 
                <p><sup>10</sup>And he took all these in the middle of the month and he dwelt at the oak of Mamre, which is near Hebron. </p> 
                <p><sup>11</sup>And he built there an altar, and sacrificed all these; and he poured their blood upon the altar, and divided them in the midst, and laid them over against each other; but the birds divided he not. </p> 
                <p><sup>12</sup>And birds came down upon the pieces, and Abram drove them away, and did not suffer the birds to touch them. </p> 
                <p><sup>13</sup>And it came to pass, when the sun had set, that an ecstasy fell upon Abram, and lo ! an horror of great darkness fell upon him, and it was said unto Abram:  'Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land (that is) not theirs, and they shall bring them into bondage, and afflict them four hundred years. </p> 
                <p><sup>14</sup>And the nation also to whom they will be in bondage will I judge, and after that they shall come forth thence with much substance. </p> 
                <p><sup>15</sup>And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace, and be buried in a good old age. </p> 
                <p><sup>16</sup>But in the fourth generation they shall return hither; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.' </p> 
                <p><sup>17</sup>And he awoke from his sleep, and he arose, and the sun had set; and there was a flame, and behold ! a furnace was smoking, and a flame of fire passed between the pieces. </p> 
                <p><sup>18</sup>And on that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying:  'To thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates, the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Perizzites, and the Rephaim, the Phakorites, and the Hivites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites. </p> 
                <p><sup>19</sup>And the day passed, and Abram offered the pieces, and the birds, and their fruit offerings, and their drink offerings, and the fire devoured them. </p> 
                <p><sup>20</sup>And on that day we made a covenant with Abram, according as we had covenanted with Noah in this month; and Abram renewed the festival and ordinance for himself for ever. </p> 
                <p><sup>21</sup>And Abram rejoiced, and made all these things known to Sarai his wife; and he believed that he would have seed, but she did not bear. </p> 
                <p><sup>22</sup>And Sarai advised her husband Abram, and said unto him:  'Go in unto Hagar, my Egyptian maid:  it may be that I shall build up seed unto thee by her.' </p> 
                <p><sup>23</sup>And Abram harkened unto the voice of Sarai his wife, and said unto her, 'Do (so).' And Sarai took Hagar, her maid, the Egyptian, and gave her to Abram, her husband, to be his wife. </p> 
                <p><sup>24</sup>And he went in unto her, and she conceived and bare him a son, and he called his name Ishmael, in the fifth year of this week [1965 A.M.]; and this was the eighty-sixth year in the life of Abram.</p>
                    
                    

    <H2>Chapter 2</H2>

              <p class="chapterTitle"> Abram celebrates the feast of first fruits, 1-2: his name changed and circumcision instituted, 3-14. Sarai's name changed and Isaak promised, 15-21. Abraham, Ishmael, and all his household circumcised, 22-24. Circumcision an eternal ordination, 25, 26. Israel shares this honour with the highest angels who were created circumcised, 27-29. Israel subject to God alone: other nations to angels, 30-32. Future faithlessness of Israel, 33-34. (Cf. Gen. xvii.)</p>
                                                      
             
                <p><sup>1</sup>And in the fifth year of the fourth week of this jubilee, [1979 A.M.] in the third month, in the middle of the month, Abram celebrated the feast of the first-fruits of the grain harvest. </p> 
                <p><sup>2</sup>And he offered new offerings on the altar, the first-fruits of the produce, unto the Lord, an heifer and a goat and a sheep on the altar as a burnt sacrifice unto the Lord; their fruit offerings and their drink offerings he offered upon the altar with frankincense. </p> 
                <p><sup>3</sup>And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him: 'I am God Almighty; approve thyself before me and be thou perfect. </p> 
                <p><sup>4</sup>And I will make My covenant between Me and thee, and I will multiply thee exceedingly.' </p> 
                <p><sup>5</sup>And Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, and said: </p> 
                <p><sup>6</sup>'Behold my ordinance is with thee,<BR> 
                                 And thou shalt be the father of many nations.</p> 
                <p><sup>7</sup>Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, <BR>
                                 But thy name from henceforth, even for ever, shall be Abraham.  <BR>
                                 For the father of many nations have I made thee.    </p> 
                <p><sup>8</sup>And I will make thee very great, <BR>
                                 And I will make thee into nations, <BR>
                                 And kings shall come forth from thee.</p> 
                <p><sup>9</sup>And I shall establish My covenant between Me and thee, and thy seed after thee, throughout their generations, for an eternal covenant, so that I may be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.               </p> 
                <p><sup>10</sup>&lt;And I will give to thee and to thy seed after thee&gt; the land where thou hast been a sojourner, the land of Canaan, that thou mayst possess it for ever, and I will be their God.' </p> 
                <p><sup>11</sup>And the Lord said unto Abraham:  'And as for thee, do thou keep my covenant, thou and thy seed after thee: and circumcise ye every male among you, and circumcise your foreskins, and it shall be a token of an eternal covenant between Me and you. </p> 
                <p><sup>12</sup>And the child on the eighth day ye shall circumcise, every male throughout your generations, him that is born in the house, or whom ye have bought with money from any stranger, whom ye have acquired who is not of thy seed.</p> 
                <p><sup>13</sup>He that is born in thy house shall surely be circumcised, and those whom thou hast bought with money shall be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an eternal ordinance. </p> 
                <p><sup>14</sup>And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin on the eigth day, that soul shall be cut off from his people, for he has broken My covenant.' </p> 
                <p><sup>15</sup>And God said unto Abraham:  'As for Sarai thy wife, her name shall no more be called Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. </p> 
                <p><sup>16</sup>And I will bless her, and give thee a son by her, and I will bless him, and he shall become a nation, and kings of nations shall proceed from him.'</p> 
                <p><sup>17</sup>And Abraham fell on his face, and rejoiced, and said in his heart: 'Shall a son be born to him that is a hundred years old, and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bring forth?'</p> 
                <p><sup>18</sup>And Abraham said unto God:  'O that Ishmael might live before thee!'</p> 
                <p><sup>19</sup>And God said:  'Yea, and Sarah also shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaac, and I will establish My covenant with him, an everlasting covenant, and for his seed after him.</p> 
                <p><sup>20</sup>And as for Ishmael also have I heard thee, and behold I will bless him, and make him great, and multiply him exceedingly, and he shall beget twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.</p> 
                <p><sup>21</sup>But My covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee, in these days, in the next year.'</p> 
                <p><sup>22</sup>And He left off speaking with him, and God went up from Abraham.</p> 
                <p><sup>23</sup>And Abraham did according as God had said unto him, and he took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and whom he had bought with his money, every male in his house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin.</p> 
                <p><sup>24</sup>And on the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and all the men of his house, &lt;and those born in the house&gt;, and all those, whom he had bought with money from the children of the stranger, were circumcised with him.</p> 
                <p><sup>25</sup>This law is for all the generations for ever, and there is no circumcision of the days, and no omission of one day out of the eight days; for it is an eternal ordinance, ordained and written on the heavenly tablets. </p> 
                <p><sup>26</sup>And every one that is born, the flesh of whose foreskin is not circumcised on the eighth day, belongs not to the children of the covenant which the Lord made with Abraham, but to the children of destruction; nor is there, moreover, any sign on him that he is the Lord's, but (he is destined) to be destroyed and slain from the earth, and to rooted out of the earth, for he has broken the covenant of the Lord our God. </p> 
                <p><sup>27</sup>For all the angels of the presence and all the angels of sanctification have been so created from the day of their creation, and before the angels of the presence and the angels of sanctification He hath sanctified Israel, that they should be with Him and with His holy angels. </p> 
                <p><sup>28</sup>And do thou command the children of Israel and let them observe the sign of this covenant for their generations as an eternal ordinance, and they will not be rooted out of the land. </p> 
                <p><sup>29</sup>For the command is ordained for a covenant, that they should observe it for ever among all the children of Israel. </p> 
                <p><sup>30</sup>For Ishmael and his sons and his brothers and Esau, the Lord did not cause to approach Him, and he chose them not because they are the children of Abraham, because He knew them, but He chose Israel to be His people. </p> 
                <p><sup>31</sup>And He sanctified it, and gathered it from amongst all the children of men; for there are many nations and many peoples, and all are His, and over all hath He placed spirits in authority to lead them astray from Him. </p> 
                <p><sup>32</sup>But over Israel He did not appoint any angel or spirit, for He alone is their ruler, and He will preserve them and require them at the hand of His angels and His spirits, and at the hand of all His powers in order that He may preserve them and bless them, and that they may be His and He may be theirs from henceforth for ever. </p> 
                <p><sup>33</sup>And now I announce unto thee that the children of Israel will not keep true to this ordinance, and they will not circumcise their sons according to all this law; for in the flesh of their circumcision they will omit this circumcision of their sons, and all of them, sons of Beliar, will leave their sons uncircumcised as they were born. </p> 
                <p><sup>34</sup>And there will be great wrath from the Lord against the children of Israel.  because they have forsaken His covenant and turned aside from His word, and provoked and blasphemed, inasmuch as they do not observe the ordinance of this law; for they have treated their members like the Gentiles, so that they may be removed and rooted out of the land. And there will no more be pardon or forgiveness unto them [so that there should be forgiveness and pardon] for all the sin of this eternal error.</p>
                            
 

    <H2>Chapter 3</H2>

            <p class="chapterTitle"> Angels appear to Abraham in Hebron and Isaac again promised, 1-4. Destruction of Sodom and Lot's deliverance, 5-9. Abraham at Beersheba: birth of and circumcision of Isaac, whose seed was to be the portion of God, 10-19. Institution of the feast of Tabernacles, 20-31. (Cf. Gen. xviii.1, 10, 12; xix.24, 29, 33-37; xx.1, 4, 8; xxi. 1-4.)</p>
                                                                    
                   
                <p><sup>1</sup>And on the new moon of the fourth month we appeared unto Abraham, at the oak of Mamre, and we talked with him, and we announced to him that a son would be given to him by Sarah his wife.</p>
                <p><sup>2</sup>And Sarah laughed, for she heard that we had spoken these words with Abraham, and we admonished her, and she became afraid, and denied that she had laughed on account of the words.</p>
                <p><sup>3</sup>And we told her the name of her son, as his name is ordained and written in the heavenly tablets (i.e.) Isaac,</p>
                <p><sup>4</sup>And (that) when we returned to her at a set time, she would have conceived a son.</p>
                <p><sup>5</sup>And in this month the Lord executed his judgments on Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Zeboim, and all the region of the Jordan, and He burned them with fire and brimstone, and destroyed them until this day, even as [lo] I have declared unto thee all their works, that they are wicked and sinners exceedingly, and that they defile themselves and commit fornication in their flesh, and work uncleanness on the earth.</p>
                <p><sup>6</sup>And, in like manner, God will execute judgment on the places where they have done according to the uncleanness of the Sodomites, like unto the judgment of Sodom.</p>
                <p><sup>7</sup>But Lot we saved; for God remembered Abraham, and sent him out from the midst of the overthrow.</p>
                <p><sup>8</sup>And he and his daughters committed sin upon the earth, such as had not been on the earth since the days of
                Adam till his time; for the man lay with his daughters.</p>
                <p><sup>9</sup>And, behold, it was commanded and engraven concerning all his seed, on the heavenly tablets, to remove them and root them out, and to execute judgment upon them like the judgment of Sodom, and to leave no seed of the man on earth on the day of condemnation.</p>
                <p><sup>10</sup>And in this month Abraham moved from Hebron, and departed and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur in the mountains of Gerar.</p>
                <p><sup>11</sup>And in the middle of the fifth month he moved from thence, and dwelt at the Well of the Oath.</p>
                <p><sup>12</sup>And in the middle of the sixth month the Lord visited Sarah and did unto her as He had spoken and she conceived.</p>
                <p><sup>13</sup>And she bare a son in the third month, and in the middle of the month, at the time of which the Lord had spoken to Abraham, on the festival of the first fruits of the harvest, Isaac was born.  </p>
                <p><sup>14</sup>And Abraham circumcised his son on the eighth day:  he was the first that was circumcised according to the covenant which is ordained for ever.</p>
                <p><sup>15</sup>And in the sixth year of the fourth week we came to Abraham, to the Well of the Oath, and we appeared unto him [as we had told Sarah that we should return to her, and she would have conceived a son.</p>
                <p><sup>16</sup>And we returned in the seventh month, and found Sarah with child before us] and we blessed him, and we announced to him all the things which had been decreed concerning him, that he should not die till he should beget six sons more, and should see (them) before he died; but (that) in Isaac should his name and seed be called:</p>
                <p><sup>17</sup>And (that) all the seed of his sons should be Gentiles, and be reckoned with the Gentiles; but from the sons of Isaac one should become a holy seed, and should not be reckoned among the Gentiles.</p>
                <p><sup>18</sup>For he should become the portion of the Most High, and all his seed had fallen into the possession of God, that it should be unto the Lord a people for (His) possession above all nations and that it should become a kingdom and priests and a holy nation.</p>
                <p><sup>19</sup>And we went our way, and we announced to Sarah all that we had told him, and they both rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</p>
                <p><sup>20</sup>And he built there an altar to the Lord who had delivered him, and who was making him rejoice in the land of his sojourning, and he celebrated a festival of joy in this month seven days, near the altar which he had built at the Well of the Oath.</p>
                <p><sup>21</sup>And he built booths for himself and for his servants on this festival, and he was the first to celebrate the feast of tabernacles on the earth.</p>
                <p><sup>22</sup>And during these seven days he brought each day to the altar a burnt offering to the Lord, two oxen, two rams, seven sheep, one he-goat, for a sin offering, that he might atone thereby for himself and for his seed.</p>
                <p><sup>23</sup>And, as a thank-offering, seven rams, seven kids, seven sheep, and seven he-goats, and their fruit offerings and their drink offerings; and he burnt all the fat thereof on the altar, a chosen offering unto the Lord for a sweet smelling savour.</p>
                <p><sup>24</sup>And morning and evening he burnt fragrant substances, frankincense and galbanum, and stackte, and nard, and myrrh, and spice, and costum; all these seven he offered, crushed, mixed together in equal parts (and) pure.</p>
                <p><sup>25</sup>And he celebrated this feast during seven days, rejoicing with all his heart and with all his soul, he and all those who were in his house, and there was no stranger with him, nor any that was uncircumcised.</p>
                <p><sup>26</sup>And he blessed his Creator who had created him in his generation, for He had created him according to His good pleasure; for He knew and perceived that from him would arise the plant of righteousness for the eternal generations, and from him a holy seed, so that it should become like Him who had made all things.</p>
                <p><sup>27</sup>And he blessed and rejoiced, and he called the name of this festival the festival of the Lord, a joy acceptable to the Most High God.</p>
                <p><sup>28</sup>And we blessed him for ever, and all his seed after him throughout all the generations of the earth, because he celebrated this festival in its season, according to the testimony of the heavenly tablets.</p>
                <p><sup>29</sup>For this reason it is ordained on the heavenly tablets concerning Israel, that they shall celebrate the feast of tabernacles seven days with joy, in the seventh month, acceptable before the Lord -a statute for ever throughout their generations every year.</p>
                <p><sup>30</sup>And to this there is no limit of days; for it is ordained for ever regarding Israel that they should celebrate it and dwell in booths, and set wreaths upon their heads, and take leafy boughs, and willows from the brook.</p>
                <p><sup>31</sup>And Abraham took branches of palm trees, and the fruit of goodly trees, and every day going round the altar with the branches seven times [a day] in the morning, he praised and gave thanks to his God for all things in joy.</p>
