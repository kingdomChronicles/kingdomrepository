        <H2>Chapter 1</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Isaac and Rebecca pray for children. Their Prayers answered, and Esau and Jacob are Born. Abraham, after recounting all the Wonderful Works of the Lord, enjoins his Son to Walk in His way and keep His Commandments. In the Fifteenth Year of Jacob and Esau's lives, Abraham Dies and is Buried by all the Kings of the land. All the People and even the children mourn for Abraham for a Full.</p>               
                    
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And in the fifty-ninth year of the life of Isaac the son of Abraham, Rebecca his wife was still barren in those days.</p> 
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And Rebecca said unto Isaac, Truly I have heard, my lord, that thy mother Sarah was barren in her days until my Lord Abraham, thy father, prayed for her and she conceived by him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>3</sup> Now therefore stand up, pray thou also to God and he will hear thy prayer and remember us through his mercies.</p> 
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And Isaac answered his wife Rebecca, saying, Abraham has already prayed for me to God to multiply his seed, now therefore this barrenness must proceed to us from thee.</p> 
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And Rebecca said unto him, But arise now thou also and pray, that the Lord may hear thy prayer and grant me children, and Isaac hearkened to the words of his wife, and Isaac and his wife rose up and went to the land of Moriah to pray there and to seek the Lord, and when they had reached that place Isaac stood up and prayed to the Lord on account of his wife because she was barren.</p> 
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And Isaac said, O Lord God of heaven and earth, whose goodness and mercies fill the earth, thou who didst take my father from his father's house and from his birthplace, and didst bring him unto this land, and didst say unto him, To thy seed will I give the land, and thou didst promise him and didst declare unto him, I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand of the sea, now may thy words be verified which thou didst speak unto my father.</p> 
                    <p><sup>7</sup> For thou art the Lord our God, our eyes are toward thee to give us seed of men, as thou didst promise us, for thou art the Lord our God and our eyes are directed toward thee only.</p>  
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And the Lord heard the prayer of Isaac the son of Abraham, and the Lord was entreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived.</p> 
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And in about seven months after the children struggled together within her, and it pained her greatly that she was wearied on account of them, and she said to all the women who were then in the land, Did such a thing happen to you as it has to me? and they said unto her, No.</p> 
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And she said unto them, Why am I alone in this amongst all the women that were upon earth? and she went to the land of Moriah to seek the Lord on account of this; and she went to Shem and Eber his son to make inquiries of them in this matter, and that they should seek the Lord in this thing respecting her.</p> 
                    <p><sup>11</sup>And she also asked Abraham to seek and inquire of the Lord about all that had befallen her.</p> 
                    <p><sup>12</sup> And they all inquired of the Lord concerning this matter, and they brought her word from the Lord and told her, Two children are in thy womb, and two nations shall rise from them; and one nation shall be stronger than the other, and the greater shall serve the younger.</p> 
                    <p><sup>13</sup> And when her days to be delivered were completed, she knelt down, and behold there were twins in her womb, as the Lord had spoken to her.</p> 
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And the first came out red all over like a hairy garment, and all the people of the land called his name Esau, saying, That this one was made complete from the womb.</p> 
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And after that came his brother, and his hand took hold of Esau's heel, therefore they called his name Jacob.</p> 
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And Isaac, the son of Abraham, was sixty years old when he begat them.</p> 
                    <p><sup>17</sup> And the boys grew up to their fifteenth year, and they came amongst the society of men. Esau was a designing and deceitful man, and an expert hunter in the field, and Jacob was a man perfect and wise, dwelling in tents, feeding flocks and learning the instructions of the Lord and the commands of his father and mother.</p> 
                    <p><sup>18</sup> And Isaac and the children of his household dwelt with his father Abraham in the land of Canaan, as God had commanded them.</p> 
                    <p><sup>19</sup> And Ishmael the son of Abraham went with his children and all belonging to them, and they returned there to the land of Havilah, and they dwelt there.</p> 
                    <p><sup>20</sup> And all the children of Abraham's concubines went to dwell in the land of the east, for Abraham had sent them away from his son, and had given them presents, and they went away.</p> 
                    <p><sup>21</sup> And Abraham gave all that he had to his son Isaac, and he also gave him all his treasures.</p> 
                    <p><sup>22</sup> And he commanded him saying, Dost thou not know and understand the Lord is God in heaven and in earth, and there is no other beside him?</p> 
                    <p><sup>23</sup> And it was he who took me from my father's house, and from my birth place, and gave me all the delights upon earth; who delivered me from the counsel of the wicked, for in him did I trust.</p> 
                    <p><sup>24</sup> And he brought me to this place, and he delivered me from Ur Casdim; and he said unto me, To thy seed will I give all these lands, and they shall inherit them when they keep my commandments, my statutes and my judgments that I have commanded thee, and which I shall command them.</p> 
                    <p><sup>25</sup> Now therefore my son, hearken to my voice, and keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I commanded thee, do not turn from the right way either to the right or to the left, in order that it may be well with thee and thy children after thee forever.</p> 
                    <p><sup>26</sup> And remember the wonderful works of the Lord, and his kindness that he has shown toward us, in having delivered us from the hands of our enemies, and the Lord our God caused them to fall into our hands; and now therefore keep all that I have commanded thee, and turn not away from the commandments of thy God, and serve none beside him, in order that it may be well with thee and thy seed after thee.</p> 
                    <p><sup>27</sup> And teach thou thy children and thy seed the instructions of the Lord and his commandments, and teach them the upright way in which they should go, in order that it may be well with them forever.</p> 
                    <p><sup>28</sup> And Isaac answered his father and said unto him, That which my Lord has commanded that will I do, and I will not depart from the commands of the Lord my God, I will keep all that he commanded me; and Abraham blessed his son Isaac, and also his children; and Abraham taught Jacob the instruction of the Lord and his ways.</p> 
                    <p><sup>29</sup> And it was at that time that Abraham died, in the fifteenth year of the life of Jacob and Esau, the sons of Isaac, and all the days of Abraham were one hundred and seventy-five years, and he died and was gathered to his people in good old age, old and satisfied with days, and Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>30</sup> And when the inhabitants of Canaan heard that Abraham was dead, they all came with their kings and princes and all their men to bury Abraham.</p> 
                    <p><sup>31</sup> And all the inhabitants of the land of Haran, and all the families of the house of Abraham, and all the princes and grandees, and the sons of Abraham by the concubines, all came when they heard of Abraham's death, and they requited Abraham's kindness, and comforted Isaac his son, and they buried Abraham in the cave which he bought from Ephron the Hittite and his children, for the possession of a burial place.</p> 
                    <p><sup>32</sup> And all the inhabitants of Canaan, and all those who had known Abraham, wept for Abraham a whole year, and men and women mourned over him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>33</sup> And all the little children, and all the inhabitants of the land wept on account of Abraham, for Abraham had been good to them all, and because he had been upright with God and men.</p> 
                    <p><sup>34</sup> And there arose not a man who feared God like unto Abraham, for he had feared his God from his youth, and had served the Lord, and had gone in all his ways during his life, from his childhood to the day of his death.</p> 
                    <p><sup>35</sup> And the Lord was with him and delivered him from the counsel of Nimrod and his people, and when he made war with the four kings of Elam he conquered them.</p> 
                    <p><sup>36</sup> And he brought all the children of the earth to the service of God, and he taught them the ways of the Lord, and caused them to know the Lord.</p> 
                    <p><sup>37</sup> And he formed a grove and he planted a vineyard therein, and he had always prepared in his tent meat and drink to those that passed through the land, that they might satisfy themselves in his house.</p> 
                    <p><sup>38</sup> And the Lord God delivered the whole earth on account of Abraham.</p> 
                    <p><sup>39</sup> And it was after the death of Abraham that God blessed his son Isaac and his children, and the Lord was with Isaac as he had been with his father Abraham, for Isaac kept all the commandments of the Lord as Abraham his father had commanded him; he did not turn to the right or to the left from the right path which his father had commanded him.</p> 
                    
                   
                    
        <H2>Chapter 2</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Esau slays Nimrod and Two of his Mighty Men. Returns Home weary from the Fight, and sells his Birthright for Value.</p>
                    
                 
         
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And Esau at that time, after the death of Abraham, frequently went in the field to hunt.</p> 
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And Nimrod king of Babel, the same was Amraphel, also frequently went with his mighty men to hunt in the field, and to walk about with his men in the cool of the day.</p> 
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And Nimrod was observing Esau all the days, for a jealousy was formed in the heart of Nimrod against Esau all the days.</p> 
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And on a certain day Esau went in the field to hunt, and he found Nimrod walking in the wilderness with his two men.</p> 
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And all his mighty men and his people were with him in the wilderness, but they removed at a distance from him, and they went from him in different directions to hunt, and Esau concealed himself for Nimrod, and he lurked for him in the wilderness.</p> 
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And Nimrod and his men that were with him did not know him, and Nimrod and his men frequently walked about in the field at the cool of the day, and to know where his men were hunting in the field.</p> 
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And Nimrod and two of his men that were with him came to the place where they were, when Esau started suddenly from his lurking place, and drew his sword, and hastened and ran to Nimrod and cut off his head.</p> 
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And Esau fought a desperate fight with the two men that were with Nimrod, and when they called out to him, Esau turned to them and smote them to death with his sword.</p> 
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And all the mighty men of Nimrod, who had left him to go to the wilderness, heard the cry at a distance, and they knew the voices of those two men, and they ran to know the cause of it, when they found their king and the two men that were with him lying dead in the wilderness.</p> 
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And when Esau saw the mighty men of Nimrod coming at a distance, he fled, and thereby escaped; and Esau took the valuable garments of Nimrod, which Nimrod's father had bequeathed to Nimrod, and with which Nimrod prevailed over the whole land, and he ran and concealed them in his house.</p> 
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And Esau took those garments and ran into the city on account of Nimrod's men, and he came unto his father's house wearied and exhausted from fight, and he was ready to die through grief when he approached his brother Jacob and sat before him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>12</sup> And he said unto his brother Jacob, Behold I shall die this day, and wherefore then do I want the birthright? And Jacob acted wisely with Esau in this matter, and Esau sold his birthright to Jacob, for it was so brought about by the Lord.</p> 
                    <p><sup>13</sup> And Esau's portion in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham had bought from the children of Heth for the possession of a burial ground, Esau also sold to Jacob, and Jacob bought all this from his brother Esau for value given.</p> 
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And Jacob wrote the whole of this in a book, and he testified the same with witnesses, and he sealed it, and the book remained in the hands of Jacob.</p> 
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And when Nimrod the son of Cush died, his men lifted him up and brought him in consternation, and buried him in his city, and all the days that Nimrod lived were two hundred and fifteen years and he died.</p> 
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And the days that Nimrod reigned upon the people of the land were one hundred and eighty-five years; and Nimrod died by the sword of Esau in shame and contempt, and the seed of Abraham caused his death as he had seen in his dream.</p> 
                    <p><sup>17</sup> And at the death of Nimrod his kingdom became divided into many divisions, and all those parts that Nimrod reigned over were restored to the respective kings of the land, who recovered them after the death of Nimrod, and all the people of the house of Nimrod were for a long time enslaved to all the other kings of the land.</p> 
                    
                    
                    
        <H2>Chapter 3</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> On account of Famine, Isaac goes to Gerar, the Land of the Philistines. After the Famine he Returns at the Command of the Lord to Hebron. Jacob is sent to the House of Shem where he Remains Thirty-two Years to learn the Way of the Lord, but Esau would not go. Esau marries a Canaanitish   Woman.</p>                 
                    
                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup> And in those days, after the death of Abraham, in that year the Lord brought a heavy famine in the land, and whilst the famine was raging in the land of Canaan, Isaac rose up to go down to Egypt on account of the famine, as his father Abraham had done.</p> 
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And the Lord appeared that night to Isaac and he said to him, Do not go down to Egypt but rise and go to Gerar, to Abimelech king of the Philistines, and remain there till the famine shall cease.</p> 
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And Isaac rose up and went to Gerar, as the Lord commanded him, and he remained there a full year.</p> 
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And when Isaac came to Gerar, the people of the land saw that Rebecca his wife was of a beautiful appearance, and the people of Gerar asked Isaac concerning his wife, and he said, She is my sister, for he was afraid to say she was his wife lest the people of the land should slay him on account of her.</p> 
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And the princes of Abimelech went and praised the woman to the king, but he answered them not, neither did he attend to their words.</p> 
                    <p><sup>6</sup> But he heard them say that Isaac declared her to be his sister, so the king reserved this within himself.</p> 
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And when Isaac had remained three months in the land, Abimelech looked out at the window, and he saw, and behold Isaac was sporting with Rebecca his wife, for Isaac dwelt in the outer house belonging to the king, so that the house of Isaac was opposite the house of the king.</p> 
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And the king said unto Isaac, What is this thou hast done to us in saying of thy wife, She is my sister? how easily might one of the great men of the people have lain with her, and thou wouldst then have brought guilt upon us.</p> 
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And Isaac said unto Abimelech, Because I was afraid lest I die on account of my wife, therefore I said, She is my sister.</p> 
                    <p><sup>10</sup> At that time Abimelech gave orders to all his princes and great men, and they took Isaac and Rebecca his wife and brought them before the king.</p> 
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And the king commanded that they should dress them in princely garments, and make them ride through the streets of the city, and proclaim before them throughout the land, saying, This is the man and this is his wife; whoever toucheth this man or his wife shall surely die. And Isaac returned with his wife to the king's house, and the Lord was with Isaac and he continued to wax great and lacked nothing.</p> 
                    <p><sup>12</sup> And the Lord caused Isaac to find favor in the sight of Abimelech, and in the sight of all his subjects, and Abimelech acted well with Isaac, for Abimelech remembered the oath and the covenant that existed between his father and Abraham.</p> 
                    <p><sup>13</sup> And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Behold the whole earth is before thee; dwell wherever it may seem good in thy sight until thou shalt return to thy land; and Abimelech gave Isaac fields and vineyards and the best part of the land of Gerar, to sow and reap and eat the fruits of the ground until the days of the famine should have passed by.</p> 
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And Isaac sowed in that land, and received a hundred-fold in the same year, and the Lord blessed him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And the man waxed great, and he had possession of flocks and possession of herds and great store of servants.</p> 
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And when the days of the famine had passed away the Lord appeared to Isaac and said unto him, Rise up, go forth from this place and return to thy land, to the land of Canaan; and Isaac rose up and returned to Hebron which is in the land of Canaan, he and all belonging to him as the Lord commanded him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>17</sup> And after this Shelach the son at Arpachshad died in that year, which is the eighteenth year of the lives of Jacob and Esau; and all the days that Shelach lived were four hundred and thirty-three years and he died.</p> 
                    <p><sup>18</sup> At that time Isaac sent his younger son Jacob to the house of Shem and Eber, and he learned the instructions of the Lord, and Jacob remained in the house of Shem and Eber for thirty-two years, and Esau his brother did not go, for he was not willing to go, and he remained in his father's house in the land of Canaan.</p> 
                    <p><sup>19</sup> And Esau was continually hunting in the fields to bring home what he could get, so did Esau all the days.</p> 
                    <p><sup>20</sup> And Esau was a designing and deceitful man, one who hunted after the hearts of men and inveigled them, and Esau was a valiant man in the field, and in the course of time went as usual to hunt; and he came as far as the field of Seir, the same is Edom.</p> 
                    <p><sup>21</sup> And he remained in the land of Seir hunting in the field a year and four months.</p> 
                    <p><sup>22</sup> And Esau there saw in the land of Seir the daughter of a man of Canaan, and her name was Jehudith, the daughter of Beeri, son of Epher, from the families of Heth the son of Canaan.</p> 
                    <p><sup>23</sup> And Esau took her for a wife, and he came unto her; forty years old was Esau when he took her, and he brought her to Hebron, the land of his father's dwelling place, and he dwelt there.</p> 
                    <p><sup>24</sup> And it came to pass in those days, in the hundred and tenth year of the life of Isaac, that is in the fiftieth year of the life of Jacob, in that year died Shem the son of Noah; Shem was six hundred years old at his death.</p> 
                    <p><sup>25</sup> And when Shem died Jacob returned to his father to Hebron which is in the land of Canaan.</p> 
                    <p><sup>26</sup> And in the fifty-sixth year of the life of Jacob, people came from Haran, and Rebecca was told concerning her brother Laban the son of Bethuel.</p> 
                    <p><sup>27</sup> For the wife of Laban was barren in those days, and bare no children, and also all his handmaids bare none to him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>28</sup> And the Lord afterward remembered Adinah the wife of Laban, and she conceived and bare twin daughters, and Laban called the names of his daughters, the name of the elder Leah, and the name of the younger Rachel.</p> 
                    <p><sup>29</sup> And those people came and told these things to Rebecca, and Rebecca rejoiced greatly that the Lord had visited her brother and that he had got children.</p> 
                    
                    
  
        <H2>Chapter 4</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Jacob by deceit obtains his Brother's Blessing. Jacob fearing his Brother's anger, flees to the House of Eber, where he remains for Fourteen Years. Esau again marries a Woman of the Land. Jacob returns to his Father, but being still threatened by Esau, is advised by his Mother to go to her Brother Laban, in Haran. Jacob goes to Haran, being Commanded by his Father not to Marry any of the Daughters of Canaan. Jacob is Waylaid on the Road, by the Son of Esau, and is Robbed of all he Possessed.</p>
                    
                   
                    
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And Isaac the son of Abraham became old and advanced in days, and his eyes became heavy through age; they were dim and could not see.</p> 
                      <p><sup>2</sup> At that time Isaac called unto Esau his son, saying, Get I pray thee thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, rise up and go forth into the field and get me some venison, and make me savory meat and bring it to me, that I may eat in order that I may bless thee before my death, as I have now become old and gray-headed.</p> 
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And Esau did so; and he took his weapon and went forth into the field to hunt for venison, as usual, to bring to his father as he had ordered him, so that he might bless him.</p> 
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And Rebecca heard all the words that Isaac had spoken unto Esau, and she hastened and called her son Jacob, saying, Thus did thy father speak unto thy brother Esau, and thus did I hear, now therefore hasten thou and make that which I shall tell thee.</p> 
                      <p><sup>5</sup> Rise up and go, I pray thee, to the flock and fetch me two fine kids of the goats, and I will get the savory meat for thy father, and thou shalt bring the savory meat that he may eat before thy brother shall have come from the chase, in order that thy father may bless thee.</p> 
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And Jacob hastened and did as his mother had commanded him, and he made the savory meat and brought it before his father before Esau had come from his chase.</p> 
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And Isaac said unto Jacob, Who art thou, my son? And he said, I am thy first born Esau, I have done as thou didst order me, now therefore rise up I pray thee, and eat of my hunt, in order that thy soul may bless me as thou didst speak unto me.</p> 
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And Isaac rose up and he ate and he drank, and his heart was comforted, and he blessed Jacob and Jacob went away from his father; and as soon as Isaac had blessed Jacob and he had gone away from him, behold Esau came from his hunt from the field, and he also made savory meat and brought it to his father to eat thereof and to bless him.</p> 
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And Isaac said unto Esau, And who was he that has taken venison and brought it me before thou camest and whom I did bless? And Esau knew that his brother Jacob had done this, and the anger of Esau was kindled against his brother Jacob that he had acted thus toward him.</p> 
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And Esau said, Is he not rightly called Jacob? for he has supplanted me twice, he took away my birthright and now he has taken away my blessing; and Esau wept greatly; and when Isaac heard the voice of his son Esau weeping, Isaac said unto Esau, What can I do, my son, thy brother came with subtlety and took away thy blessing; and Esau hated his brother Jacob on account of the blessing that his father had given him, and his anger was greatly roused against him.</p> 
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And Jacob was very much afraid of his brother Esau, and he rose up and fled to the house of Eber the son of Shem, and he concealed himself there on account of his brother, and Jacob was sixty-three years old when he went forth from the land of Canaan from Hebron, and Jacob was concealed in Eber's house fourteen years on account of his brother Esau, and he there continued to learn the ways of the Lord and his commandments.</p> 
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And when Esau saw that Jacob had fled and escaped from him, and that Jacob had cunningly obtained the blessing, then Esau grieved exceedingly, and he was also vexed at his father and mother; and he also rose up and took his wife and went away from his father and mother to the land of Seir, and he dwelt there; and Esau saw there a woman from amongst the daughters of Heth whose name was Bosmath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and he took her for a wife in addition to his first wife, and Esau called her name Adah, saying the blessing had in that time passed from him.</p> 
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And Esau dwelt in the land of Seir six months without seeing his father and mother, and afterward Esau took his wives and rose up and returned to the land of Canaan, and Esau placed his two wives in his father's house in Hebron.</p> 
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And the wives of Esau vexed and provoked Isaac and Rebecca with their works, for they walked not in the ways of the Lord, but served their father's gods of wood and stone as their father had taught them, and they were more wicked than their father.</p> 
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And they went according to the evil desires of their hearts, and they sacrificed and burnt incense to the Baalim, and Isaac and Rebecca became weary of them.</p> 
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And Rebecca said, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good then is life unto me?</p> 
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And in those days Adah the wife of Esau conceived and bare him a son, and Esau called the name of the son that was born unto him Eliphaz, and Esau was sixty-five years old when she bare him.</p> 
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And Ishmael the son of Abraham died in those days, in the sixty-forth year of the life of Jacob, and all the days that Ishmael lived were one hundred and thirty-seven years and he died.</p> 
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And when Isaac heard that Ishmael was dead he mourned for him, and Isaac lamented over him many days.</p> 
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And at the end of fourteen years of Jacob's residing in the house of Eber, Jacob desired to see his father and mother, and Jacob came to the house of his father and mother to Hebron, and Esau had in those days forgotten what Jacob had done to him in having taken the blessing from him in those days.</p> 
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And when Esau saw Jacob coming to his father and mother he remembered what Jacob had done to him, and he was greatly incensed against him and he sought to slay him.</p> 
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And Isaac the son of Abraham was old and advanced in days, and Esau said, Now my father's time is drawing nigh that he must die, and when he shall die I will slay my brother Jacob.</p> 
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And this was told to Rebecca, and she hastened and sent and called for Jacob her son, and she said unto him, Arise, go and flee to Haran to my brother Laban, and remain there for some time, until thy brother's anger be turned from thee and then shalt thou come back.</p> 
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And Isaac called unto Jacob and said unto him, Take not a wife from the daughters of Canaan, for thus did our father Abraham command us according to the word of the Lord which he had commanded him, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; if thy children keep my covenant that I have made with thee, then will I also perform to thy children that which I have spoken unto thee and I will not forsake them.</p> 
                      <p><sup>25</sup> Now therefore my son hearken to my voice, to all that I shall command thee, and refrain from taking a wife from amongst the daughters of Canaan; arise, go to Haran to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father, and take unto thee a wife from there from the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.</p> 
                      <p><sup>26</sup> Therefore take heed lest thou shouldst forget the Lord thy God and all his ways in the land to which thou goest, and shouldst get connected with the people of the land and pursue vanity and forsake the Lord thy God.</p> 
                      <p><sup>27</sup> But when thou comest to the land serve there the Lord, do not turn to the right or to the left from the way which I commanded thee and which thou didst learn.</p> 
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And may the Almighty God grant thee favor in the sight of the people of the earth, that thou mayest take there a wife according to thy choice; one who is good and upright in the ways of the Lord.</p> 
                      <p><sup>29</sup> And may God give unto thee and thy seed the blessing of thy father Abraham, and make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and mayest thou become a multitude of people in the land whither thou goest, and may God cause thee to return to this land, the land of thy father's dwelling, with children and with great riches, with joy and with pleasure.</p> 
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And Isaac finished commanding Jacob and blessing him, and he gave him many gifts, together with silver and gold, and he sent him away; and Jacob hearkened to his father and mother; he kissed them and arose and went to Padan-aram; and Jacob was seventy-seven years old when he went out from the land of Canaan from Beersheba.</p> 
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And when Jacob went away to go to Haran Esau called unto his son Eliphaz, and secretly spoke unto him, saying, Now hasten, take thy sword in thy hand and pursue Jacob and pass before him in the road, and lurk for him, and slay him with thy sword in one of the mountains, and take all belonging to him and come back.</p> 
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And Eliphaz the son of Esau was an active man and expert with the bow as his father had taught him, and he was a noted hunter in the field and a valiant man.</p> 
                      <p><sup>33</sup> And Eliphaz did as his father had commanded him, and Eliphaz was at that time thirteen years old, and Eliphaz rose up and went and took ten of his mother's brothers with him and pursued Jacob.</p> 
                      <p><sup>34</sup> And he closely followed Jacob, and he lurked for him in the border of the land of Canaan opposite to the city of Shechem.</p> 
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And Jacob saw Eliphaz and his men pursuing him, and Jacob stood still in the place in which he was going, in order to know what this was, for he did not know the thing; and Eliphaz drew his sword and he went on advancing, he and his men, toward Jacob; and Jacob said unto them, What is to do with you that you have come hither, and what meaneth it that you pursue with your swords.</p> 
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And Eliphaz came near to Jacob and he answered and said unto him, Thus did my father command me, and now therefore I will not deviate from the orders which my father gave me; and when Jacob saw that Esau had spoken to Eliphaz to employ force, Jacob then approached and supplicated Eliphaz and his men, saying to him,</p> 
                      <p><sup>37</sup> Behold all that I have and which my father and mother gave unto me, that take unto thee and go from me, and do not slay me, and may this thing be accounted unto thee a righteousness.</p> 
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And the Lord caused Jacob to find favor in the sight of Eliphaz the son of Esau, and his men, and they hearkened to the voice of Jacob, and they did not put him to death, and Eliphaz and his men took all belonging to Jacob together with the silver and gold that he had brought with him from Beersheba; they left him nothing.</p> 
                      <p><sup>39</sup> And Eliphaz and his men went away from him and they returned to Esau to Beersheba, and they told him all that had occurred to them with Jacob, and they gave him all that they had taken from Jacob.</p> 
                      <p><sup>40</sup> And Esau was indignant at Eliphaz his son, and at his men that were with him, because they had not put Jacob to death.</p> 
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And they answered and said unto Esau, Because Jacob supplicated us in this matter not to slay him, our pity was excited toward him, and we took all belonging to him and brought it unto thee; and Esau took all the silver and gold which Eliphaz had taken from Jacob and he put them by in his house.</p> 
                      <p><sup>42</sup> At that time when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and had commanded him, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife from amongst the daughters of Canaan, and that the daughters of Canaan were bad in the sight of Isaac and Rebecca,</p> 
                      <p><sup>43</sup> Then he went to the house of Ishmael his uncle, and in addition to his older wives he took Machlath the daughter of Ishmael, the sister of Nebayoth, for a wife.</p>
