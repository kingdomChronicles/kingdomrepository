        <H2>Chapter 1</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle">Rikayon's cunning Device to make Money of the Egyptians.</p>       
        

                    
                    <p><sup>1</sup>In those days there was in the land of Shinar a wise man who had understanding in all wisdom, and of a beautiful appearance, but he was poor and indigent; his name was Rikayon and he was hard set to support himself.</p> 
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And he resolved to go to Egypt, to Oswiris the son of Anom king of Egypt, to show the king his wisdom; for perhaps he might find grace in his sight, to raise him up and give him maintenance; and Rikayon did so.</p> 
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And when Rikayon came to Egypt he asked the inhabitants of Egypt concerning the king, and the inhabitants of Egypt told him the custom of the king of Egypt, for it was then the custom of the king of Egypt that he went from his royal palace and was seen abroad only one day in the year, and after that the king would return to his palace to remain there.</p> 
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And on the day when the king went forth he passed judgment in the land, and every one having a suit came before the king that day to obtain his request.</p> 
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And when Rikayon heard of the custom in Egypt and that he could not come into the presence of the king, he grieved greatly and was very sorrowful.</p> 
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And in the evening Rikayon went out and found a house in ruins, formerly a bake house in Egypt, and he abode there all night in bitterness of soul and pinched with hunger, and sleep was removed from his eyes.</p> 
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And Rikayon considered within himself what he should do in the town until the king made his appearance, and how he might maintain himself there.</p> 
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And he rose in the morning and walked about, and met in his way those who sold vegetables and various sorts of seed with which they supplied the inhabitants.</p> 
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And Rikayon wished to do the same in order to get a maintenance in the city, but he was unacquainted with the custom of the people, and he was like a blind man among them.</p> 
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And he went and obtained vegetables to sell them for his support, and the rabble assembled about him and ridiculed him, and took his vegetables from him and left him nothing.</p> 
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And he rose up from there in bitterness of soul, and went sighing to the bake house in which he had remained all the night before, and he slept there the second night.</p> 
                    <p><sup>12</sup> And on that night again he reasoned within himself how he could save himself from starvation, and he devised a scheme how to act.</p> 
                    <p><sup>13</sup> And he rose up in the morning and acted ingeniously, and went and hired thirty strong men of the rabble, carrying their war instruments in their hands, and he led them to the top of the Egyptian sepulchre, and he placed them there.</p> 
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And he commanded them, saying, Thus saith the king, Strengthen yourselves and be valiant men, and let no man be buried here until two hundred pieces of silver be given, and then he may be buried; and those men did according to the order of Rikayon to the people of Egypt the whole of that year.</p> 
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And in eight months time Rikayon and his men gathered great riches of silver and gold, and Rikayon took a great quantity of horses and other animals, and he hired more men, and he gave them horses and they remained with him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And when the year came round, at the time the king went forth into the town, all the inhabitants of Egypt assembled together to speak to him concerning the work of Rikayon and his men.</p> 
                    <p><sup>17</sup> And the king went forth on the appointed day, and all the Egyptians came before him and cried unto him, saying,</p> 
                    <p><sup>18</sup> May the king live forever. What is this thing thou doest in the town to thy servants, not to suffer a dead body to be buried until so much silver and gold be given? Was there ever the like unto this done in the whole earth, from the days of former kings yea even from the days of Adam, unto this day, that the dead should not be buried only for a set price?</p> 
                    <p><sup>19</sup> We know it to be the custom of kings to take a yearly tax from the living, but thou dost not only do this, but from the dead also thou exactest a tax day by day.</p> 
                    <p><sup>20</sup> Now, O king, we can no more bear this, for the whole city is ruined on this account, and dost thou not know it?</p> 
                    <p><sup>21</sup>And when the king heard all that they had spoken he was very wroth, and his anger burned within him at this affair, for he had known nothing of it.</p> 
                    <p><sup>22</sup> And the king said, Who and where is he that dares to do this wicked thing in my land without my command? Surely you will tell me.</p> 
                    <p><sup>23</sup> And they told him all the works of Rikayon and his men, and the king's anger was aroused, and he ordered Rikayon and his men to be brought before him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>24</sup> And Rikayon took about a thousand children, sons and daughters, and clothed them in silk and embroidery, and he set them upon horses and sent them to the king by means of his men, and he also took a great quantity of silver and gold and precious stones, and a strong and beautiful horse, as a present for the king, with which he came before the king and bowed down to the earth before him; and the king, his servants and all the inhabitants of Egypt wondered at the work of Rikayon, and they saw his riches and the present that he had brought to the king.</p> 
                    <p><sup>25</sup> And it greatly pleased the king and he wondered at it; and when Rikayon sat before him the king asked him concerning all his works, and Rikayon spoke all his words wisely before the king, his servants and all the inhabitants of Egypt.</p> 
                    <p><sup>26</sup> And when the king heard the words of Rikayon and his wisdom, Rikayon found grace in his sight, and he met with grace and kindness from all the servants of the king and from all the inhabitants of Egypt, on account of his wisdom and excellent speeches, and from that time they loved him exceedingly.</p> 
                    <p><sup>27</sup> And the king answered and said to Rikayon, Thy name shall no more be called Rikayon but Pharaoh shall be thy name, since thou didst exact a tax from the dead; and he called his name Pharaoh.</p> 
                    <p><sup>28</sup> And the king and his subjects loved Rikayon for his wisdom, and they consulted with all the inhabitants of Egypt to make him prefect under the king.</p> 
                    <p><sup>29</sup> And all the inhabitants of Egypt and its wise men did so, and it was made a law in Egypt.</p> 
                    <p><sup>30</sup> And they made Rikayon Pharaoh prefect under Oswiris king of Egypt, and Rikayon Pharaoh governed over Egypt, daily administering justice to the whole city, but Oswiris the king would judge the people of the land one day in the year, when he went out to make his appearance.</p> 
                    <p><sup>31</sup> And Rikayon Pharaoh cunningly usurped the government of Egypt, and he exacted a tax from all the inhabitants of Egypt.</p> 
                    <p><sup>32</sup> And all the inhabitants of Egypt greatly loved Rikayon Pharaoh, and they made a decree to call every king that should reign over them and their seed in Egypt, Pharaoh.</p> 
                    <p><sup>33</sup> Therefore all the kings that reigned in Egypt from that time forward were called Pharaoh unto this day.</p> 


        <H2>Chapter 2</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle">On Account of Famine in Canaan, Abram goes to Egypt. Tells the People that Sarah is his Sister, on account of her Beauty. Pharaoh Desires to take her, but is Prevented by an Angel of the Lord. The Truth is made known, and Sarah is Restored to Abram, with many Presents. Abram returns to his Home. Trouble between Lot and Abram on account of Lot's cattle. Lot Removes to Sodom.</p>                  



                    <p><sup>1</sup> And in that year there was a heavy famine throughout the land of Canaan, and the inhabitants of the land could not remain on account of the famine for it was very grievous.</p> 
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And Abram and all belonging to him rose and went down to Egypt on account of the famine, and when they were at the brook Mitzraim they remained there some time to rest from the fatigue of the road.</p> 
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And Abram and Sarai were walking at the border of the brook Mitzraim, and Abram beheld his wife Sarai that she was very beautiful.</p> 
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And Abram said to his wife Sarai, Since God has created thee with such a beautiful countenance, I am afraid of the Egyptians lest they should slay me and take thee away, for the fear of God is not in these places.</p> 
                    <p><sup>5</sup> Surely then thou shalt do this, Say thou art my sister to all that may ask thee, in order that it may be well with me, and that we may live and not be put to death.</p> 
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And Abram commanded the same to all those that came with him to Egypt on account of the famine; also his nephew Lot he commanded, saying, If the Egyptians ask thee concerning Sarai say she is the sister of Abram.</p> 
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And yet with all these orders Abram did not put confidence in them, but he took Sarai and placed her in a chest and concealed it amongst their vessels, for Abram was greatly concerned about Sarai on account of the wickedness of the Egyptians.</p> 
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And Abram and all belonging to him rose up from the brook Mitzraim and came to Egypt; and they had scarcely entered the gates of the city when the guards stood up to them saying, Give tithe to the king from what you have, and then you may come into the town; and Abram and those that were with him did so.</p> 
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And Abram with the people that were with him came to Egypt, and when they came they brought the chest in which Sarai was concealed and the Egyptians saw the chest.</p> 
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And the king's servants approached Abram, saying, What hast thou here in this chest which we have not seen? Now open thou the chest and give tithe to the king of all that it contains.</p> 
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And Abram said, This chest I will not open, but all you demand upon it I will give. And Pharaoh's officers answered Abram, saying, It is a chest of precious stones, give us the tenth thereof.</p> 
                    <p><sup>12</sup> Abram said, All that you desire I will give, but you must not open the chest.</p> 
                    <p><sup>13</sup> And the king's officers pressed Abram, and they reached the chest and opened it with force, and they saw, and behold a beautiful woman was in the chest.</p> 
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And when the officers of the king beheld Sarai they were struck with admiration at her beauty, and all the princes and servants of Pharaoh assembled to see Sarai, for she was very beautiful. And the king's officers ran and told Pharaoh all that they had seen, and they praised Sarai to the king; and Pharaoh ordered her to be brought, and the woman came before the king.</p> 
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And Pharaoh beheld Sarai and she pleased him exceedingly, and he was struck with her beauty, and the king rejoiced greatly on her account, and made presents to those who brought him the tidings concerning her.</p> 
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And the woman was then brought to Pharaoh's house, and Abram grieved on account of his wife, and he prayed to the Lord to deliver her from the hands of Pharaoh.</p> 
                    <p><sup>17</sup> And Sarai also prayed at that time and said, O Lord God thou didst tell my Lord Abram to go from his land and from his father's house to the land of Canaan, and thou didst promise to do well with him if he would perform thy commands; now behold we have done that which thou didst command us, and we left our land and our families, and we went to a strange land and to a people whom we have not known before.</p> 
                    <p><sup>18</sup> And we came to this land to avoid the famine, and this evil accident has befallen me; now therefore, O Lord God, deliver us and save us from the hand of this oppressor, and do well with me for the sake of thy mercy.</p> 
                    <p><sup>19</sup> And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Sarai, and the Lord sent an angel to deliver Sarai from the power of Pharaoh.</p> 
                    <p><sup>20</sup> And the king came and sat before Sarai and behold an angel of the Lord was standing over them, and he appeared to Sarai and said to her, Do not fear, for the Lord has heard thy prayer.</p> 
                    <p><sup>21</sup> And the king approached Sarai and said to her, What is that man to thee who brought thee hither? and she said, He is my brother.</p> 
                    <p><sup>22</sup> And the king said, It is incumbent upon us to make him great, to elevate him and to do unto him all the good which thou shalt command us; and at that time the king sent to Abram silver and gold and precious stones in abundance, together with cattle, men servants and maid servants; and the king ordered Abram to be brought, and he sat in the court of the king's house, and the king greatly exalted Abram on that night.</p> 
                    <p><sup>23</sup> And the king approached to speak to Sarai, and he reached out his hand to touch her, when the angel smote him heavily, and he was terrified and he refrained from reaching to her.</p> 
                    <p><sup>24</sup> And when the king came near to Sarai, the angel smote him to the ground, and acted thus to him the whole night, and the king was terrified.</p> 
                    <p><sup>25</sup> And the angel on that night smote heavily all the servants of the king, and his whole household, on account of Sarai, and there was a great lamentation that night amongst the people of Pharaoh's house.</p> 
                    <p><sup>26</sup> And Pharaoh, seeing the evil that befell him, said, Surely on account of this woman has this thing happened to me, and he removed himself at some distance from her and spoke pleasing words to her.</p> 
                    <p><sup>27</sup> And the king said to Sarai, Tell me I pray thee concerning the man with whom thou camest here; and Sarai said, This man is my husband, and I said to thee that he was my brother for I was afraid, lest thou shouldst put him to death through wickedness.</p> 
                    <p><sup>28</sup> And the king kept away from Sarai, and the plagues of the angel of the Lord ceased from him and his household; and Pharaoh knew that he was smitten on account of Sarai, and the king was greatly astonished at this.</p> 
                    <p><sup>29</sup> And in the morning the king called for Abram and said to him, What is this thou hast done to me? Why didst thou say, She is my sister, owing to which I took her unto me for a wife, and this heavy plague has therefore come upon me and my household.</p> 
                    <p><sup>30</sup> Now therefore here is thy wife, take her and go from our land lest we all die on her account. And Pharaoh took more cattle, men servants and maid servants, and silver and gold, to give to Abram, and he returned unto him Sarai his wife.</p> 
                    <p><sup>31</sup> And the king took a maiden whom he begat by his concubines, and he gave her to Sarai for a handmaid.</p> 
                    <p><sup>32</sup> And the king said to his daughter, It is better for thee my daughter to be a handmaid in this man's house than to be mistress in my house, after we have beheld the evil that befell us on account of this woman.</p> 
                    <p><sup>33</sup> And Abram arose, and he and all belonging to him went away from Egypt; and Pharaoh ordered some of his men to accompany him and all that went with him.</p>  
                    <p><sup>34</sup> And Abram returned to the land of Canaan, to the place where he had made the altar, where he at first had pitched his tent.</p> 
                    <p><sup>35</sup> And Lot the son of Haran, Abram's brother, had a heavy stock of cattle, flocks and herds and tents, for the Lord was bountiful to them on account of Abram.</p> 
                    <p><sup>36</sup> And when Abram was dwelling in the land the herdsmen of Lot quarrelled with the herdsmen of Abram, for their property was too great for them to remain together in the land, and the land could not bear them on account of their cattle.</p> 
                    <p><sup>37</sup> And when Abram's herdsmen went to feed their flock they would not go into the fields of the people of the land, but the cattle of Lot's herdsmen did otherwise, for they were suffered to feed in the fields of the people of the land.</p> 
                    <p><sup>38</sup> And the people of the land saw this occurrence daily, and they came to Abram and quarrelled with him on account of Lot's herdsmen.</p> 
                    <p><sup>39</sup> And Abram said to Lot, What is this thou art doing to me, to make me despicable to the inhabitants of the land, that thou orderest thy herdsman to feed thy cattle in the fields of other people? Dost thou not know that I am a stranger in this land amongst the children of Canaan, and why wilt thou do this unto me?</p> 
                    <p><sup>40</sup> And Abram quarrelled daily with Lot on account of this, but Lot would not listen to Abram, and he continued to do the same and the inhabitants of the land came and told Abram.</p> 
                    <p><sup>41</sup> And Abram said unto Lot, How long wilt thou be to me for a stumbling block with the inhabitants of the land? Now I beseech thee let there be no more quarrelling between us, for we are kinsmen.</p> 
                    <p><sup>42</sup> But I pray thee separate from me, go and choose a place where thou mayest dwell with thy cattle and all belonging to thee, but Keep thyself at a distance from me, thou and thy household.</p> 
                    <p><sup>43</sup> And be not afraid in going from me, for if any one do an injury to thee, let me know and I will avenge thy cause from him, only remove from me.</p> 
                    <p><sup>44</sup> And when Abram had spoken all these words to Lot, then Lot arose and lifted up his eyes toward the plain of Jordan.</p> 
                    <p><sup>45</sup> And he saw that the whole of this place was well watered, and good for man as well as affording pasture for the cattle.</p> 
                    <p><sup>46</sup> And Lot went from Abram to that place, and he there pitched his tent and he dwelt in Sodom, and they were separated from each other.</p> 
                    <p><sup>47</sup> And Abram dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and he pitched his tent there, and Abram remained in that place many years.</p> 
                    


        <H2>Chapter 3</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Four Kings with Eight Hundred Thousand Men War against Sodom and the Cities of the Plain, and destroy and plunder their people. Abram, Hearing that Lot is taken captive, gathers together about Three Hundred Men and Pursues the Kings, retakes the captives, and smites the whole Army of the confederate Rings. On his Return, Abram meets Adonizedek, King of Jerusalem, the same was Shem. Abram gives Tithing of all he had taken to Adonizedek, and is Blessed of Him. Abram Restores to every Man his property which he had retaken in the War, and returns to Hebron. The Lord again appears to Abram and promises to bless him with a Numberless Posterity. Sarah being childless gives Hagar to Abram for a Wife, and becoming jealous of her, afflicts her. An Angel comforts Hagar. Ishmael is Born.</p>    



                    <p><sup>1</sup> At that time Chedorlaomer king of Elam sent to all the neighboring kings, to Nimrod, king of Shinar who was then under his power, and to Tidal, king of Goyim, and to Arioch, king of Elasar, with whom he made a covenant, saying, Come up to me and assist me, that we may smite all the towns of Sodom and its inhabitants, for they have rebelled against me these thirteen years.</p> 
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And these four kings went up with all their camps, about eight hundred thousand men, and they went as they were, and smote every man they found in their road.</p> 
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And the five kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, Bera king of Sodom, Bersha king of Gomorrah, and Bela king of Zoar, went out to meet them, and they all joined together in the valley of Siddim.</p> 
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And these nine kings made war in the valley of Siddim; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah were smitten before the kings of Elam.</p> 
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And the valley of Siddim was full of lime pits and the kings of Elam pursued the kings of Sodom, and the kings of Sodom with their camps fled and fell into the lime pits, and all that remained went to the mountain for safety, and the five kings of Elam came after them and pursued them to the gates of Sodom, and they took all that there was in Sodom.</p> 
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And they plundered all the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and they also took Lot, Abram's brother's son, and his property, and they seized all the goods of the cities of Sodom, and they went away; and Unic, Abram's servant, who was in the battle, saw this, and told Abram all that the kings had done to the cities of Sodom, and that Lot was taken captive by them.</p> 
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And Abram heard this, and he rose up with about three hundred and eighteen men that were with him, and he that night pursued these kings and smote them, and they all fell before Abram and his men, and there was none remaining but the four kings who fled, and they went each his own road.</p> 
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And Abram recovered all the property of Sodom, and he also recovered Lot and his property, his wives and little ones and all belonging to him, so that Lot lacked nothing.</p> 
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And when he returned from smiting these kings, he and his men passed the valley of Siddim where the kings had made war together.</p> 
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And Bera king of Sodom, and the rest of his men that were with him, went out from the lime pits into which they had fallen, to meet Abram and his men.</p> 
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And Adonizedek king of Jerusalem, the same was Shem, went out with his men to meet Abram and his people, with bread and wine, and they remained together in the valley of Melech.</p> 
                    <p><sup>12</sup> And Adonizedek blessed Abram, and Abram gave him a tenth from all that he had brought from the spoil of his enemies, for Adonizedek was a priest before God.</p> 
                    <p><sup>13</sup> And all the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah who were there, with their servants, approached Abram and begged of him to return them their servants whom he had made captive, and to take unto himself all the property.</p> 
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And Abram answered the kings of Sodom, saying, As the Lord liveth who created heaven and earth, and who redeemed my soul from all affliction, and who delivered me this day from my enemies, and gave them into my hand, I will not take anything belonging to you, that you may not boast tomorrow, saying, Abram became rich from our property that he saved.</p> 
                    <p><sup>15</sup> For the Lord my God in whom I trust said unto me, Thou shalt lack nothing, for I will bless thee in all the works of thy hands.</p> 
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And now therefore behold, here is all belonging to you, take it and go; as the Lord liveth I will not take from you from a living soul down to a shoetie or thread, excepting the expense of the food of those who went out with me to battle, as also the portions of the men who went with me, Anar, Ashcol, and Mamre, they and their men, as well as those also who had remained to watch the baggage, they shall take their portion of the spoil.</p> 
                    <p><sup>17</sup> And the kings of Sodom gave Abram according to all that he had said, and they pressed him to take of whatever he chose, but he would not.</p> 
                    <p><sup>18</sup> And he sent away the kings of Sodom and the remainder of their men, and he gave them orders about Lot, and they went to their respective places.</p> 
                    <p><sup>19</sup> And Lot, his brother's son, he also sent away with his property, and he went with them, and Lot returned to his home, to Sodom, and Abram and his people returned to their home to the plains of Mamre, which is in Hebron.</p> 
                    <p><sup>20</sup> At that time the Lord again appeared to Abram in Hebron, and he said to him, Do not fear, thy reward is very great before me, for I will not leave thee, until I shall have multiplied thee, and blessed thee and made thy seed like the stars in heaven, which cannot be measured nor numbered.</p> 
                    <p><sup>21</sup> And I will give unto thy seed all these lands that thou seest with thine eyes, to them will I give them for an inheritance forever, only be strong and do not fear, walk before me and be perfect.</p> 
                    <p><sup>22</sup> And in the seventy-eighth year of the life of Abram, in that year died Reu, the son of Peleg, and all the days of Reu were two hundred and thirty-nine years, and he died.</p> 
                    <p><sup>23</sup> And Sarai, the daughter of Haran, Abram's wife, was still barren in those days; she did not bear to Abram either son or daughter.</p> 
                    <p><sup>24</sup> And when she saw that she bare no children she took her handmaid Hagar, whom Pharaoh had given her, and she gave her to Abram her husband for a wife.</p> 
                    <p><sup>25</sup> For Hagar learned all the ways of Sarai as Sarai taught her, she was not in any way deficient in following her good ways.</p> 
                    <p><sup>26</sup> And Sarai said to Abram, Behold here is my handmaid Hagar, go to her that she may bring forth upon my knees, that I may also obtain children through her.</p> 
                    <p><sup>27</sup> And at the end of ten years of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan, which is the eighty-fifth year of Abram's life, Sarai gave Hagar unto him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>28</sup> And Abram hearkened to the voice of his wife Sarai, and he took his handmaid Hagar and Abram came to her and she conceived.</p> 
                    <p><sup>29</sup> And when Hagar saw that she had conceived she rejoiced greatly, and her mistress was despised in her eyes, and she said within herself, This can only be that I am better before God than Sarai my mistress, for all the days that my mistress has been with my lord, she did not conceive, but me the Lord has caused in so short a time to conceive by him.</p> 
                    <p><sup>30</sup> And when Sarai saw that Hagar had conceived by Abram, Sarai was jealous of her handmaid, and Sarai said within herself, This is surely nothing else but that she must be better than I am.</p> 
                    <p><sup>31</sup> And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee, for at the time when thou didst pray before the Lord for children why didst thou not pray on my account, that the Lord should give me seed from thee?</p> 
                    <p><sup>32</sup> And when I speak to Hagar in thy presence, she despiseth my words, because she has conceived, and thou wilt say nothing to her; may the Lord judge between me and thee for what thou hast done to me.</p> 
                    <p><sup>33</sup> And Abram said to Sarai, Behold thy handmaid is in thy hand, do unto her as it may seem good in thy eyes; and Sarai afflicted her, and Hagar fled from her to the wilderness.</p> 
                    <p><sup>34</sup> And an angel of the Lord found her in the place where she had fled, by a well, and he said to her, Do not fear, for I will multiply thy seed, for thou shalt bear a son and thou shalt call his name Ishmael; now then return to Sarai thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.</p> 
                    <p><sup>35</sup> And Hagar called the place of that well Beer-lahai-roi, it is between Kadesh and the wilderness of Bered.</p> 
                    <p><sup>36</sup> And Hagar at that time returned to her master's house, and at the end of days Hagar bare a son to Abram, and Abram called his name Ishmael; and Abram was eighty-six years old when he begat him.</p>
