        <p class="chapterTitle">THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS OF MAN WHOM GOD CREATED UPON THE EARTH ON THE DAY WHEN THE LORD GOD MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH.</p>

        <H2>Chapter 1</H2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Creation of Adam and Eve. The Fall. Birth of Cain and Abel. Abel a Keeper of Sheep. Cain a Tiller of the Soil. The Quarrel Between the Brothers and the Result. Cain, the First Murderer, Cursed of God.</p>

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and God created man in his own image.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And God formed man from the ground, and he blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul endowed with speech.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And the Lord said, It is not good for man to be alone; I will make unto him a helpmeet.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept, and he took away one of his ribs, and he built flesh upon it, and formed it and brought it to Adam, and Adam awoke from his sleep, and behold a woman was standing before him.</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And he said, This is a bone of my bones and it shall be called woman, for this has been taken from man; and Adam called her name Eve, for she was the mother of all living.</p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And God blessed them and called their names Adam and Eve in the day that he created them, and the Lord God said, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.</p>
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And the Lord God took Adam and his wife, and he placed them in the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it; and he commanded them and said unto them, From every tree of the garden you may eat, but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die. </p>
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And when God had blessed and commanded them, he went from them, and Adam and his wife dwelt in the garden according to the command which the Lord had commanded them.</p>
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And the serpent, which God had created with them in the earth, came to them to incite them to transgress the command of God which he had commanded them.</p>
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And the serpent enticed and persuaded the woman to eat from the tree of knowledge, and the woman hearkened to the voice of the serpent, and she transgressed the word of God, and took from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and she ate, and she took from it and gave also to her husband and he ate.</p>
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And Adam and his wife transgressed the command of God which he commanded them, and God knew it, and his anger was kindled against them and he cursed them.</p>
                    <p><sup>12</sup> And the Lord God drove them that day from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which they were taken, and they went and dwelt at the east of the garden of Eden; and Adam knew his wife Eve and she bore two sons and three daughters.</p>
                    <p><sup>13</sup> And she called the name of the first born Cain, saying, I have obtained a man from the Lord, and the name of the other she called Abel, for she said, In vanity we came into the earth, and in vanity we shall be taken from it.</p>
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And the boys grew up and their father gave them a possession in the land; and Cain was a tiller of the ground, and Abel a keeper of sheep.</p>
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And it was at the expiration of a few years, that they brought an approximating offering to the Lord, and Cain brought from the fruit of the ground, and Abel brought from the firstlings of his flock from the fat thereof, and God turned and inclined to Abel and his offering, and a fire came down from the Lord from heaven and consumed it.</p>
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And unto Cain and his offering the Lord did not turn, and he did not incline to it, for he had brought from the inferior fruit of the ground before the Lord, and Cain was jealous against his brother Abel on account of this, and he sought a pretext to slay him.</p>
                    <p><sup>17</sup> And in some time after, Cain and Abel his brother, went one day into the field to do their work; and they were both in the field, Cain tilling and ploughing his ground, and Abel feeding his flock; and the flock passed that part which Cain had ploughed in the ground, and it sorely grieved Cain on this account.</p>
                    <p><sup>18</sup> And Cain approached his brother Abel in anger, and he said unto him, What is there between me and thee, that thou comest to dwell and bring thy flock to feed in my land?</p>
                    <p><sup>19</sup> And Abel answered his brother Cain and said unto him, What is there between me and thee, that thou shalt eat the flesh of my flock and clothe thyself with their wool?</p>
                    <p><sup>20</sup> And now therefore, put off the wool of my sheep with which thou hast clothed thyself, and recompense me for their fruit and flesh which thou hast eaten, and when thou shalt have done this, I will then go from thy land as thou hast said?</p>
                    <p><sup>21</sup> And Cain said to his brother Abel, Surely if I slay thee this day, who will require thy blood from me?</p>
                    <p><sup>22</sup> And Abel answered Cain, saying, Surely God who has made us in the earth, he will avenge my cause, and he will require my blood from thee shouldst thou slay me, for the Lord is the judge and arbiter, and it is he who will requite man according to his evil, and the wicked man according to the wickedness that he may do upon earth.</p>
                    <p><sup>23</sup> And now, if thou shouldst slay me here, surely God knoweth thy secret views, and will judge thee for the evil which thou didst declare to do unto me this day.</p>
                    <p><sup>24</sup> And when Cain heard the words which Abel his brother had spoken, behold the anger of Cain was kindled against his brother Abel for declaring this thing.</p>
                    <p><sup>25</sup> And Cain hastened and rose up, and took the iron part of his ploughing instrument, with which he suddenly smote his brother and he slew him, and Cain spilt the blood of his brother Abel upon the earth, and the blood of Abel streamed upon the earth before the flock.</p>
                    <p><sup>26</sup> And after this Cain repented having slain his brother, and he was sadly grieved, and he wept over him and it vexed him  exceedingly.</p>
                    <p><sup>27</sup> And Cain rose up and dug a hole in the field, wherein he put his brother's body, and he turned the dust over it.</p>
                    <p><sup>28</sup> And the Lord knew what Cain had done to his brother, and the Lord appeared to Cain and said unto him, Where is Abel thy brother that was with thee?</p>
                    <p><sup>29</sup> And Cain dissembled, and said, I do not know, am I my brother's keeper? And the Lord said unto him, What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground where thou hast slain him.</p>
                    <p><sup>30</sup> For thou hast slain thy brother and hast dissembled before me, and didst imagine in thy heart that I saw thee not, nor knew all thy actions.</p>
                    <p><sup>31</sup>  But thou didst this thing and didst slay thy brother for naught and because he spoke rightly to thee, and now, therefore, cursed be thou from the ground which opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand, and wherein thou didst bury him.</p>
                    <p><sup>32</sup> And it shall be when thou shalt till it, it shall no more give thee its strength as in the beginning, for thorns and thistles shall the ground produce, and thou shalt be moving and wandering in the earth until the day of thy death.</p>
                    <p><sup>33</sup> And at that time Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, from the place where he was, and he went moving and wandering in the land toward the east of Eden, he and all belonging to him.</p>
                    <p><sup>34</sup> And Cain knew his wife in those days, and she conceived and bare a son, and he called his name Enoch, saying, In that time the Lord began to give him rest and quiet in the earth.</p>
                    <p><sup>35</sup> And at that time Cain also began to build a city: and he built the city and he called the name of the city Enoch, according to the name of his son; for in those days the Lord had given him rest upon the earth, and he did not move about and wander as in the beginning.</p>
                    <p><sup>36</sup> And Irad was born to Enoch, and Irad begat Mechuyael and Mechuyael begat Methusael.</p>
                    
                    
        <H2>Chapter 2</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle">Seth is Born. People begin to Multiply and Become Idolatrous. Third Part of the Earth Destroyed. Earth cursed and becomes corrupt through the Wickedness of Men. Cainan, a Wise and Righteous King, Foretells the Flood. Enoch is Born.</p>            
                  

                    <p><sup>1</sup> And it was in the hundred and thirtieth year of the life of Adam upon the earth, that he again knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bare a son in his likeness and in his image, and she called his name Seth, saying, Because God has appointed me another seed in the place of Abel, for Cain has slain him.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And Seth lived one hundred and five years, and he begat a son; and Seth called the name of his son Enosh, saying, Because in that time the sons of men began to multiply, and to afflict their souls and hearts by transgressing and rebelling against God.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And it was in the days of Enosh that the sons of men continued to rebel and transgress against God, to increase the anger of the Lord against the sons of men.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And the sons of men went and they served other gods, and they forgot the Lord who had created them in the earth: and in those days the sons of men made images of brass and iron, wood and stone, and they bowed down and served them.</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And every man made his god and they bowed down to them, and the sons of men forsook the Lord all the days of Enosh and his children; and the anger of the Lord was kindled on account of their works and abominations which they did in the earth.</p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And the Lord caused the waters of the river Gihon to overwhelm them, and he destroyed and consumed them, and he destroyed the third part of the earth, and notwithstanding this, the sons of men did not turn from their evil ways, and their hands were yet extended to do evil in the sight of the Lord.</p>
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And in those days there was neither sowing nor reaping in the earth; and there was no food for the sons of men and the famine was very great in those days. </p>
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And the seed which they sowed in those days in the ground became thorns, thistles and briers; for from the days of Adam was this declaration concerning the earth, of the curse of God, which he cursed the earth, on account of the sin which Adam sinned before the Lord. </p>
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And it was when men continued to rebel and transgress against God, and to corrupt their ways, that the earth also became corrupt.</p>
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And Enosh lived ninety years and he begat Cainan;</p>
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And Cainan grew up and he was forty years old, and he became wise and had knowledge and skill in all wisdom, and he reigned over all the sons of men, and he led the sons of men to wisdom and knowledge; for Cainan was a very wise man and had understanding in all wisdom, and with his wisdom he ruled over spirits and demons;</p>
                    <p><sup>12</sup> And Cainan knew by his wisdom that God would destroy the sons of men for having sinned upon earth, and that the Lord would in the latter days bring upon them the waters of the flood.</p>
                    <p><sup>13</sup> And in those days Cainan wrote upon tablets of stone, what was to take place in time to come, and he put them in his treasures.</p>
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And Cainan reigned over the whole earth, and he turned some of the sons of men to the service of God.</p>
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And when Cainan was seventy years old, he begat three sons and two daughters.</p>
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And these are the names of the children of Cainan; the name of the first born Mahlallel, the second Enan, and the third Mered, and their sisters were Adah and Zillah; these are the five children of Cainan that were born to him.</p>
                    <p><sup>17</sup> And Lamech, the son of Methusael, became related to Cainan by marriage, and he took his two daughters for his wives, and Adah conceived and bare a son to Lamech, and she called his name Jabal.</p>
                    <p><sup>18</sup> And she again conceived and bare a son, and called his name Jubal; and Zillah, her sister, was barren in those days and had no offspring.</p>
                    <p><sup>19</sup> For in those days the sons of men began to trespass against God, and to transgress the commandments which he had commanded to Adam, to be fruitful and multiply in the earth.</p>
                    <p><sup>20</sup> And some of the sons of men caused their wives to drink a draught that would render them barren, in order that they might retain their figures and whereby their beautiful appearance might not fade.</p>
                    <p><sup>21</sup> And when the sons of men caused some of their wives to drink, Zillah drank with them.</p>
                    <p><sup>22</sup> And the child-bearing women appeared abominable in the sight of their husbands as widows, whilst their husbands lived, for to the barren ones only they were attached.</p>
                    <p><sup>23</sup> And in the end of days and years, when Zillah became old, the Lord opened her womb.</p>
                    <p><sup>24</sup> And she conceived and bare a son and she called his name Tubal Cain, saying, After I had withered away have I obtained him from the Almighty God.</p>
                    <p><sup>25</sup> And she conceived again and bare a daughter, and she called her name Naamah, for she said, After I had withered away have I obtained pleasure and delight.</p>
                    <p><sup>26</sup> And Lamech was old and advanced in years, and his eyes were dim that he could not see, and Tubal Cain, his son, was leading him and it was one day that Lamech went into the field and Tubal Cain his son was with him, and whilst they were walking in the field, Cain the son of Adam advanced towards them; for Lamech was very old and could not see much, and Tubal Cain his son was very young.</p>
                    <p><sup>27</sup> And Tubal Cain told his father to draw his bow, and with the arrows he smote Cain, who was yet far off, and he slew him, for he appeared to them to be an animal.</p>
                    <p><sup>28</sup> And the arrows entered Cain's body although he was distant from them, and he fell to the ground and died.</p>
                    <p><sup>29</sup> And the Lord requited Cain's evil according to his wickedness, which he had done to his brother Abel, according to the word of the Lord which he had spoken.</p>
                    <p><sup>30</sup> And it came to pass when Cain had died, that Lamech and Tubal went to see the animal which they had slain, and they saw, and behold Cain their grandfather was fallen dead upon the earth.</p>
                    <p><sup>31</sup>  And Lamech was very much grieved at having done this, and in clapping his hands together he struck his son and caused his death.</p>
                    <p><sup>32</sup> And the wives of Lamech heard what Lamech had done, and they sought to kill him.</p>
                    <p><sup>33</sup> And the wives of Lamech hated him from that day, because he slew Cain and Tubal Cain, and the wives of Lamech separated from him, and would not hearken to him in those days.</p>
                    <p><sup>34</sup>  And Lamech came to his wives, and he pressed them to listen to him about this matter.</p>
                    <p><sup>35</sup> And he said to his wives Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice O wives of Lamech, attend to my words, for now you have imagined and said that I slew a man with my wounds, and a child with my stripes for their having done no violence, but surely know that I am old and grey-headed, and that my eyes are heavy through age, and I did this thing unknowingly.</p>
                    <p><sup>36</sup> And the wives of Lamech listened to him in this matter, and they returned to him with the advice of their father Adam, but they bore no children to him from that time, knowing that God's anger was increasing in those days against the sons of men, to destroy them with the waters of the flood for their evil doings.</p>
                    <p><sup>37</sup> And Mahlallel the son of Cainan lived sixty-five years and he begat Jared; and Jared lived sixty-two years and he begat Enoch. </p>
                 
      
        <H2>Chapter 3</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle">Enoch Reigns over the Earth. Enoch Establishes Righteousness upon the Earth, and after Reigning Two Hundred and Forty Years is Translated.</p>


                    <p><sup>1</sup> And Enoch lived sixty-five years and he begat Methuselah; and Enoch walked with God after having begot Methuselah, and he served the Lord, and despised the evil ways of men.</p>
                    <p><sup>2</sup> And the soul of Enoch was wrapped up in the instruction of the Lord, in knowledge and in understanding; and he wisely retired from the sons of men, and secreted himself from them for many days.</p>
                    <p><sup>3</sup> And it was at the expiration of many years, whilst he was serving the Lord, and praying before him in his house, that an angel of the Lord called to him from Heaven, and he said, Here am I.</p>
                    <p><sup>4</sup> And he said, Rise, go forth from thy house and from the place where thou dost hide thyself, and appear to the sons of men, in order that thou mayest teach them the way in which they
                      should go and the work which they must accomplish to enter in the ways of God.</p>
                    <p><sup>5</sup> And Enoch rose up according to the word of the Lord, and went forth from his house, from his place and from the chamber in which he was concealed; and he went to the sons of men and taught them the ways of the Lord, and at that time assembled the sons of men and acquainted them with the instruction of the Lord.</p>
                    <p><sup>6</sup> And he ordered it to be proclaimed in all places where the sons of men dwelt, saying, Where is the man who wishes to know the ways of the Lord and good works? let him come to Enoch.</p>
                    <p><sup>7</sup> And all the sons of men then assembled to him, for all who desired this thing went to Enoch, and Enoch reigned over the sons of men according to the word of the Lord, and they came and bowed to him and they heard his word.</p>
                    <p><sup>8</sup> And the spirit of God was upon Enoch, and he taught all his men the wisdom of God and his ways, and the sons of men served the Lord all the days of Enoch, and they came to hear his wisdom.</p>
                    <p><sup>9</sup> And all the kings of the sons of men, both first and last, together with their princes and judges, came to Enoch when they heard of his wisdom, and they bowed down to him, and they also required of Enoch to reign over them, to which he consented.</p>
                    <p><sup>10</sup> And they assembled in all, one hundred and thirty kings and princes, and they made Enoch king over them and they were all under his power and command.</p>
                    <p><sup>11</sup> And Enoch taught them wisdom, knowledge, and the ways of the Lord; and he made peace amongst them, and peace was throughout the earth during the life of Enoch.</p>
                    <p><sup>12</sup> And Enoch reigned over the sons of men two hundred and forty-three years, and he did justice and righteousness with all his people, and he led them in the ways of the Lord.</p>
                    <p><sup>13</sup> And these are the generations of Enoch, Methuselah, Elisha, and Elimelech, three sons; and their sisters were Melca and Nahmah, and Methuselah lived eighty-seven years and he begat Lamech.</p>
                    <p><sup>14</sup> And it was in the fifty-sixth year of the life of Lamech when Adam died; nine hundred and thirty years old was he at his death, and his two sons, with Enoch and Methuselah his son, buried him with great pomp, as at the burial of kings, in the cave which God had told him.</p>
                    <p><sup>15</sup> And in that place all the sons of men made a great mourning and weeping on account of Adam; it has therefore become a custom among the sons of men to this day.</p>
                    <p><sup>16</sup> And Adam died because he ate of the tree of knowledge; he and his children after him, as the Lord God had spoken.</p>
                    <p><sup>17</sup> And it was in the year of Adam's death which was the two hundred and forty-third year of the reign of Enoch, in that time Enoch resolved to separate himself from the sons of men and to secret himself as at first in order to serve the Lord.</p>
                    <p><sup>18</sup> And Enoch did so, but did not entirely secret himself from them, but kept away from the sons of men three days and then went to them for one day.</p>
                    <p><sup>19</sup> And during the three days that he was in his chamber, he prayed to, and praised the Lord his God, and the day on which he went and appeared to his subjects he taught them the ways of the Lord, and all they asked him about the Lord he told them.</p>
                    <p><sup>20</sup> And he did in this manner for many years, and he afterward concealed himself for six days, and appeared to his people one day in seven; and after that once in a month, and then once in a year, until all the kings, princes and sons of men sought for him, and desired again to see the face of Enoch, and to hear his word; but they could not, as all the sons of men were greatly afraid of Enoch, and they feared to approach him on account of the Godlike awe that was seated upon his countenance; therefore no man could look at him, fearing he might be punished and die.</p>
                    <p><sup>21</sup> And all the kings and princes resolved to assemble the sons of men, and to come to Enoch, thinking that they might all speak to him at the time when he should come forth amongst them, and they did so.</p>
                    <p><sup>22</sup> And the day came when Enoch went forth and they all assembled and came to him, and Enoch spoke to them the words of the Lord and he taught them wisdom and knowledge, and they bowed down before him and they said, May the king live! May the king live!</p>
                    <p><sup>23</sup>  And in some time after, when the kings and princes and the sons of men were speaking to Enoch, and Enoch was teaching them the ways of God, behold an angel of the Lord then called unto Enoch from heaven, and wished to bring him up to heaven to make him reign there over the sons of God, as he had reigned over the sons of men upon earth.</p>
                    <p><sup>24</sup> When at that time Enoch heard this he went and assembled all the inhabitants of the earth, and taught them wisdom and knowledge and gave them divine instructions, and he said to them, I have been required to ascend into heaven, I therefore do not know the day of my going.</p>
                    <p><sup>25</sup> And now therefore I will teach you wisdom and knowledge and will give you instruction before I leave you, how to act upon earth whereby you may live; and he did so.</p>
                    <p><sup>26</sup> And he taught them wisdom and knowledge, and gave them instruction, and he reproved them, and he placed before them statutes and judgments to do upon earth, and he made peace amongst them, and he taught them everlasting life, and dwelt with them some time teaching them all these things.</p>
                    <p><sup>27</sup> And at that time the sons of men were with Enoch, and Enoch was speaking to them, and they lifted up their eyes and the likeness of a great horse descended from heaven, and the horse paced in the air;</p>
                    <p><sup>28</sup> And they told Enoch what they had seen, and Enoch said to them, On my account does this horse descend upon earth; the time is come when I must go from you and I shall no more be seen by you.</p>
                    <p><sup>29</sup> And the horse descended at that time and stood before Enoch, and all the sons of men that were with Enoch saw him.</p>
                    <p><sup>30</sup> And Enoch then again ordered a voice to be proclaimed, saying, Where is the man who delighteth to know the ways of the Lord his God, let him come this day to Enoch before he is taken from us.</p>
                    <p><sup>31</sup> And all the sons of men assembled and came to Enoch that day; and all the kings of the earth with their princes and counsellors remained with him that day; and Enoch then taught the sons of men wisdom and knowledge, and gave them divine instruction; and he bade them serve the Lord and walk in his ways all the days of their lives, and he continued to make peace amongst them.</p>
                    <p><sup>32</sup> And it was after this that he rose up and rode upon the horse; and he went forth and all the sons of men went after him, about eight hundred thousand men; and they went with him one day's journey.</p>
                    <p><sup>33</sup> And the second day he said to them, Return home to your tents, why will you go? perhaps you may die; and some of them went from him, and those that remained went with him six day's journey; and Enoch said to them every day, Return to your tents, lest you may die; but they were not willing to return, and they went with him.</p>
                    <p><sup>34</sup> And on the sixth day some of the men remained and clung to him, and they said to him, We will go with thee to the place where thou goest; as the Lord liveth, death only shall separate us.</p>
                    <p><sup>35</sup> And they urged so much to go with him, that he ceased speaking to them; and they went after him and would not return;</p>
                    <p><sup>36</sup> And when the kings returned they caused a census to be taken, in order to know the number of remaining men that went with Enoch; and it was upon the seventh day that Enoch ascended into heaven in a whirlwind, with horses and chariots of fire.</p>
                    <p><sup>37</sup> And on the eighth day all the kings that had been with Enoch sent to bring back the number of men that were with Enoch, in that place from which he ascended into heaven.</p>
                    <p><sup>38</sup> And all those kings went to the place and they found the earth there filled with snow, and upon the snow were large stones of snow, and one said to the other, Come, let us break through the snow and see, perhaps the men that remained with Enoch are dead, and are now under the stones of snow, and they searched but could not find him, for he had ascended into heaven.</p>
