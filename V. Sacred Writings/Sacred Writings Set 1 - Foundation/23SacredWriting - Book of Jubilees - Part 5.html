<p class="chapterTitle">How to compute Jubilee years</p>
<p>
1 Jubilee  = 7 weeks <br>
1 Week     = 7 years <br>
1 Jubilee  = 49 years
</p>
<p>Sample Computation:</p>
<p>There are 49 Jubilees, 2 weeks and 2 years from Adam to the 40 days of Moses on Mt. Sinai.</p>
<p>
49 jubilees x 49 years / jubilee =    2401 years <br>
7 weeks x 7 years / week ----- =    49 years <br>
2 years------------------------- =     2  years 
</p>

<p>2,401 years + 49 years + 2 years = 2410 years from Adam to Mt Sinai when the Law was given to Moses </p>

    <H2>Chapter 1</H2>

            <p class="chapterTitle"> Reu and Serug, 1 (cf. Gen. xi.20, 21). Rise of war and bloodshed and eating of blood and idolatry, 2-7. Nachor and Terah, 8-14 (cf. Gen. xi.22-30). Abram's knowledge of God and wonderful deeds, 15-24.</p>
                              
                                       
                <p><sup>1</sup>And in the thirty-fifth jubilee, in the third week, in the first year [1681 A.M.] thereof, Reu took to himself a wife, and her name was '&Ocirc;r&acirc;, the daughter of '&Ucirc;r, the son of Kesed, and she bare him a son, and he called his name S&ecirc;r&ocirc;h, in the seventh year of this week in this jubilee. [1687 A.M.] </p>                  
                <p><sup>2</sup>And the sons of Noah began to war on each other, to take captive and to slay each other, and to shed the blood of men on the earth, and to eat blood, and to build strong cities, and walls, and towers, and individuals (began) to exalt themselves above the nation, and to found the beginnings of kingdoms, and to go to war people against people, and nation against nation, and city against city, and all (began) to do evil, and to acquire arms, and to teach their sons war, and they began to capture cities, and to sell male and female slaves.  </p>                      
                <p><sup>3</sup>And '&Ucirc;r, the son of Kesed, built the city of 'Ara of the Chaldees, and called its name after his own name and the name of his father.  And they made for themselves molten images, and they worshipped each the idol, the molten image which they had made for themselves, and they began to make graven images and unclean simulacra, and malignant spirits assisted and seduced (them) into committing transgression and uncleanness.  </p>                      
                <p><sup>4</sup>And the prince Mast&ecirc;m&acirc; exerted himself to do all this, and he sent forth other spirits, those which were put under his hand, to do all manner of wrong and sin, and all manner of transgression, to corrupt and destroy, and to shed blood upon the earth.  </p>                    
                <p><sup>5</sup>For this reason he called the name of S&ecirc;r&ocirc;h, Serug, for every one turned to do all manner of sin and transgression.  </p>                       
                <p><sup>6</sup>And he grew up, and dwelt in Ur of the Chaldees, near to the father of his wife's mother, and he worshipped idols, and he took to himself a wife in the thirty-sixth jubilee, in the fifth week, in the first year thereof, [1744 A.M.] and her name was Melka, the daughter of Kaber, the daughter of his father's brother.  </p>                      
                <p><sup>7</sup>And she bare him Nahor, in the first year of this week, and he grew and dwelt in Ur of the Chaldees, and his father taught him the researches of the Chaldees to divine and augur, according to the signs of heaven. </p>                        
                <p><sup>8</sup>And in the thirty-seventh jubilee in the sixth week, in the first year thereof, [1800 A.M.] he took to himself a wife, and her name was 'Ijaska, the daughter of Nestag of the Chaldees.</p>                         
                <p><sup>9</sup>And she bare him Terah in the seventh year of this week. [1806 A.M.]</p>                                           
                <p><sup>10</sup>And the prince Mast&ecirc;m&acirc; sent ravens and birds to devour the seed which was sown in the land, in order to destroy the land, and rob the children of men of their labours. Before they could plough in the seed, the ravens picked (it) from the surface of the ground.  </p>                       
                <p><sup>11</sup>And for this reason he called his name Terah because the ravens and the birds reduced them to destitution and devoured their seed.</p>                         
                <p><sup>12</sup>And the years began to be barren, owing to the birds, and they devoured all the fruit of the trees from the trees:  it was only with great effort that they could save a little of all the fruit of the earth in their days.</p>                         
                <p><sup>13</sup>And in this thirty-ninth jubilee, in the second week in the first year, [1870 A.M.] Terah took to himself a wife, and her name was 'Edna, the daughter of 'Abram, the daughter of his father's sister.  And in the seventh year of this week [1876 A.M.] she bare him a son, and he called his name Abram, by the name of the father of his mother; </p>                        
                <p><sup>14</sup>for he had died before his daughter had conceived a son.</p>                         
                <p><sup>15</sup>And the child began to understand the errors of the earth that all went astray after graven images and after uncleanness, and his father taught him writing, and he was two weeks of years old, [1890 A.M.] and he separated himself from his father, that he might not worship idols with him.</p>                          
                <p><sup>16</sup>And he began to pray to the Creator of all things that He might save him from the errors of the children of men, and that his portion should not fall into error after uncleanness and vileness.  </p>                        
                <p><sup>17</sup>And the seed time came for the sowing of seed upon the land, and they all went forth together to protect their seed against the ravens, and Abram went forth with those that went, and the child was a lad of fourteen years.</p>                     
                <p><sup>18</sup>And a cloud of ravens came to devour the seed, and Abram ran to meet them before they settled on the ground, and cried to them before they settled on the ground to devour the seed, and said, ' Descend not:  return to the place whence ye came,' and they proceeded to turn back. </p>                         
                <p><sup>19</sup>And he caused the clouds of ravens to turn back that day seventy times, and of all the ravens throughout all the land where Abram was there settled there not so much as one.</p>                          
                <p><sup>20</sup>And all who were with him throughout all the land saw him cry out, and all the ravens turn back, and his name became great in all the land of the Chaldees. </p>                        
                <p><sup>21</sup>And there came to him this year all those that wished to sow, and he went with them until the time of sowing ceased:  and they sowed their land, and that year they brought enough grain home and eat and were satisfied.</p>                          
                <p><sup>22</sup>And in the first year of the fifth week [1891 A.M.] Abram taught those who made implements for oxen, the artificers in wood, and they made a vessel above the ground, facing the frame of the plough, in order to put the seed thereon, and the seed fell down therefrom upon the share of the plough, and was hidden in the earth, and they no longer feared the ravens. </p>                         
                <p><sup>23</sup>And after this manner they made (vessels) above the ground on all the frames of the ploughs, and they sowed and tilled all the land, according as Abram commanded them, and they no longer feared the birds.</p>
                    

    <H2>Chapter 2</H2>

            <p class="chapterTitle"> Abram seeks to run Terah from idolatry, 1-8. Marries Sarai, 9. Haran and Nachor, 9-11. Abram burns the idols: death of Haran, 12-14 (cf. Gen. xi.28). Terah and his family go to Haran, 15. Abram observes the stars and prays, 16-21. Is bidden to go to Canaan and blessed, 22-24. Power of speaking Hebrew given to him, 25-27. Leaves Haran for Canaan, 28-31. (Cf. Gen. xi.31-xii.3.)</p>
                                      
                                                       
                  <p><sup>1</sup>And it came to pass in the sixth week, in the seventh year thereof, [1904 A.M.] that Abram said to Terah his father, saying, 'Father!'</p>  
                  <p><sup>2</sup>And he said, 'Behold, here am I, my son.'  And he said,<BR>
                            'What help and profit have we from those idols which thou dost worship, <BR>
                             And before which thou dost bow thyself?</p>                
                  <p><sup>3</sup>For there is no spirit in them, <BR>
                             For they are dumb forms, and a misleading of the heart. <BR>
                             Worship them not:  </p>                  
                  <p><sup>4</sup>Worship the God of heaven, <BR>
                             Who causes the rain and the dew to descend on the earth <BR>
                             And does everything upon the earth,<BR><BR>                
                             And has created everything by His word, <BR>
                             And all life is from before His face.</p>                
                  <p><sup>5</sup>Why do ye worship things that have no spirit in them? <BR>
                             For they are the work of (men's) hands,<BR><BR>                
                             And on your shoulders do ye bear them, <BR>
                             And ye have no help from them,<BR><BR>    
                             But they are a great cause of shame to those who make them,<BR>
                             And a misleading of the heart to those who worship them: <BR>
                             Worship them not.'</p>              
                  <p><sup>6</sup>And his father said unto him, I also know it, my son, but what shall I do with a people who have made me to serve before them?</p>  
                  <p><sup>7</sup>And if I tell them the truth, they will slay me; for their soul cleaves to them to worship them and honour them.</p>  
                  <p><sup>8</sup>Keep silent, my son, lest they slay thee.' And these words he spake to his two brothers, and they were angry with him and he kept silent.</p>  
                  <p><sup>9</sup>And in the fortieth jubilee, in the second week, in the seventh year thereof, [1925 A.M.] Abram took to himself a wife, and her name was Sarai, the daughter of his father, and she became his wife.</p>  
                  <p><sup>10</sup>And Haran, his brother, took to himself a wife in the third year of the third week, [1928 A.M.] and she bare him a son in the seventh year of this week, [1932 A.M.] and he called his name Lot.</p>  
                  <p><sup>11</sup>And Nahor, his brother, took to himself a wife.</p>  
                  <p><sup>12</sup>And in the sixtieth year of the life of Abram, that is, in the fourth week, in the fourth year thereof, [1936 A.M.] Abram arose by night, and burned the house of the idols, and he burned all that was in the house and no man knew it.</p>  
                  <p><sup>13</sup>And they arose in the night and sought to save their gods from the midst of the fire.</p>  
                  <p><sup>14</sup>And Haran hasted to save them, but the fire flamed over him, and he was burnt in the fire, and he died in Ur of the Chaldees before Terah his father, and they buried him in Ur of the Chaldees.</p>  
                  <p><sup>15</sup>And Terah went forth from Ur of the Chaldees, he and his sons, to go into the land of Lebanon and into the land of Canaan, and he dwelt in the land of Haran, and Abram dwelt with Terah his father in Haran two weeks of years.</p>  
                  <p><sup>16</sup>And in the sixth week, in the fifth year thereof, [1951 A.M.] Abram sat up throughout the night on the new moon of the seventh month to observe the stars from the evening to the morning, in order to see what would be the character of the year with regard to the rains, and he was alone as he sat and observed.</p>  
                  <p><sup>17</sup>And a word came into his heart and he said:  All the signs of the stars, and the signs of the moon and of the sun are all in the hand of the Lord.  Why do I search (them) out? </p>           
                  <p><sup>18</sup>If He desires, He causes it to rain, morning and evening;<BR>
                             And if He desires, He withholds it, <BR>
                             And all things are in his hand.'</p>
                  <p><sup>19</sup>And he prayed that night and said, <BR>
                             'My God, God Most High, Thou alone art my God, <BR>
                             And Thee and Thy dominion have I chosen.  <BR>
                             And Thou hast created all things, <BR>
                             And all things that are the work of thy hands.</p>
                  <p><sup>20</sup>Deliver me from the hands of evil spirits who have dominion over the thoughts of men's hearts, <BR>
                             And let them not lead me astray from Thee, my God.<BR><BR>   
                             And stablish Thou me and my seed for ever <BR>
                             That we go not astray from henceforth and for evermore.'</p>
                  <p><sup>21</sup>And he said, 'Shall I return unto Ur of the Chaldees who seek my face that I may return to them, am I to remain here in this place?  The right path before Thee prosper it in the hands of Thy servant that he may fulfil (it) and that I may not walk in the deceitfulness of my heart, O my God.'</p> 
                  <p><sup>22</sup>And he made an end of speaking and praying, and behold the word of the Lord was sent to him through me, saying:  'Get thee up from thy country, and from thy kindred and from the house of thy father unto a land which I will show thee, and I shall make thee a great and numerous nation.</p>
                  <p><sup>23</sup>And I will bless thee <BR>
                             And I will make thy name great,  <BR>
                             And thou shalt be blessed in the earth,  <BR>
                             And in Thee shall all families of the earth be blessed,  <BR>
                             And I will bless them that bless thee,  <BR>
                             And curse them that curse thee.</p>
                  <p><sup>24</sup>And I will be a God to thee and thy son, and to thy son's son, and to all thy seed:  fear not, from
                            henceforth and unto all generations of the earth I am thy God.'</p>  
                  <p><sup>25</sup>And the Lord God said: 'Open his mouth and his ears, that he may hear and speak with his mouth, with the language which has been revealed'; for it had ceased from the mouths of all the children of men from the day of the overthrow (of Babel).</p>  
                  <p><sup>26</sup>And I opened his mouth, and his ears and his lips, and I began to speak with him in Hebrew in the tongue of the creation.</p>  
                  <p><sup>27</sup>And he took the books of his fathers, and these were written in Hebrew, and he transcribed them, and he began from henceforth to study them, and I made known to him that which he could not (understand), and he studied them during the six rainy months.</p>  
                  <p><sup>28</sup>And it came to pass in the seventh year of the sixth week [1953 A.M.] that he spoke to his father and informed him, that he would leave Haran to go into the land of Canaan to see it and return to him.</p>  
                  <p><sup>29</sup>And Terah his father said unto him; Go in peace:<BR><BR>
                        
                             May the eternal God make thy path straight.  <BR>
                             And the Lord [(be) with thee, and] protect thee from all evil, <BR>
                             And grant unto thee grace, mercy and favour before those who see thee, <BR>
                             And may none of the children of men have power over thee to harm thee; <BR>
                             Go in peace.</p>
                  <p><sup>30</sup>And if thou seest a land pleasant to thy eyes to dwell in, then arise and take me to thee and take Lot with thee, the son of Haran thy brother as thine own son:  the Lord be with thee.</p>      
                  <p><sup>31</sup>And Nahor thy brother leave with me till thou returnest in peace, and we go with thee all together.'</p>
