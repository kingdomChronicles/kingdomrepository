                      <p><sup>18</sup> And the sons of Joseph, that were born unto him in Egypt, were Manasseh and Ephraim.</p>
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And all the souls that went forth from the loins of Jacob, were seventy souls; these are they who came with Jacob their father unto Egypt to dwell there: and Joseph and all his brethren dwelt securely in Egypt, and they ate of the best of Egypt all the days of the life of
                      Joseph.</p>
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And Joseph lived in the land of Egypt ninety-three years, and Joseph reigned over all Egypt eighty years.</p>
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And when the days of Joseph drew nigh that he should die, he sent and called for his brethren and all his father's household, and they all came together and sat before him.</p>
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And Joseph said unto his brethren and unto the whole of his father's household, Behold I die, and God will surely visit you and bring you up from this land to the land which he swore to your fathers to give unto them.</p>
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And it shall be when God shall visit you to bring you up from here to the land of your fathers, then bring up my bones with you from here.</p>
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And Joseph made the sons of Israel to swear for their seed after them, saying, God will surely visit you and you shall bring up my bones with you from here.</p>
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And it came to pass after this that Joseph died in that year, the seventy-first year of the Israelites going down to Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And Joseph was one hundred and ten years old when he died in the land of Egypt, and all his brethren and all his servants rose up and they embalmed Joseph, as was their custom, and his brethren and all Egypt mourned over him for seventy days.</p>
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And they put Joseph in a coffin filled with spices and all sorts of perfume, and they buried him by the side of the river, that is Sihor, and his sons and all his brethren, and the whole of his father's household made a seven day's mourning for him.</p>
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And it came to pass after the death of Joseph, all the Egyptians began in those days to rule over the children of Israel, and Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who reigned in his father's stead, took all the laws of Egypt and conducted the whole government of Egypt under his counsel, and he reigned securely over his people.</p>
                


        <H2>Chapter 2</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle">Zepho, the Son of Eliphaz, the Son of Esau, who was taken Captive by Joseph where he Buried his Father, Escapes from Egypt with all his
          Men.</p> 

          
                        
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And when the year came round, being the seventy-second year from the Israelites going down to Egypt, after the death of Joseph, Zepho, the son of Eliphaz, the son of Esau, fled from Egypt, he and his men, and they went away.</p>
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And he came to Africa, which is Dinhabah, to Angeas king of Africa, and Angeas received them with great honor, and he made Zepho the captain of his host.</p>
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And Zepho found favor in the sight of Angeas and in the sight of his people, and Zepho was captain of the host to Angeas king of Africa for many days.</p>
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And Zepho enticed Angeas king of Africa to collect all his army to go and fight with the Egyptians, and with the sons of Jacob, and to avenge of them the cause of his brethren.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> But Angeas would not listen to Zepho to do this thing, for Angeas knew the strength of the sons of Jacob, and what they had done to his army in their warfare with the children of Esau.</p>
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And Zepho was in those days very great in the sight of Angeas and in the sight of all his people, and he continually enticed them to make war against Egypt, but they would not.</p>
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And it came to pass in those days there was in the land of Chittim a man in the city of Puzimna, whose name was Uzu, and he became degenerately deified by the children of Chittim, and the man died and had no son, only one daughter whose name was Jania.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And the damsel was exceedingly beautiful, comely and intelligent, there was none seen like unto her for beauty and wisdom throughout the land.</p>
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And the people of Angeas king of Africa saw her and they came and praised her unto him, and Angeas sent to the children of Chittim, and he requested to take her unto himself for a wife, and the people of Chittim consented to give her unto him for a wife.</p>
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And when the messengers of Angeas were going forth from the land of Chittim to take their journey, behold the messengers of Turnus king of Bibentu came unto Chittim, for Turnus king of Bibentu also sent his messengers to request Jania for him, to take unto himself for a wife, for all his men had also praised her to him, therefore he sent all his servants unto her.</p>
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And the servants of Turnus came to Chittim, and they asked for Jania, to be taken unto Turnus their king for a wife.</p>
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And the people of Chittim said unto them, We cannot give her, because Angeas king of Africa desired her to take her unto him for a wife before you came, and that we should give her unto him, and now therefore we cannot do this thing to deprive Angeas of the damsel in order to give her unto Turnus.</p>
                      <p><sup>13</sup> For we are greatly afraid of Angeas lest he come in battle against us and destroy us, and Turnus your master will not be able to deliver us from his hand.</p>
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And when the messengers of Turnus heard all the words of the children of Chittim, they turned back to their master and told him all the words of the children of Chittim.</p>
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And the children of Chittim sent a memorial to Angeas, saying, Behold Turnus has sent for Jania to take her unto him for a wife, and thus have we answered him; and we heard that he has collected his whole army to go to war against thee, and he intends to pass by the road of
                      Sardunia to fight against thy brother Lucus, and after that he will come to fight against thee.</p>
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And Angeas heard the words of the children of Chittim which they sent to him in the record, and his anger was kindled and he rose up and assembled his whole army and came through the islands of the sea, the road to Sardunia, unto his brother Lucus king of Sardunia.</p>
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And Niblos, the son of Lucus, heard that his uncle Angeas was coming, and he went out to meet him with a heavy army, and he kissed him and embraced him, and Niblos said unto Angeas, When thou askest my father after his welfare, when I shall go with thee to fight with
                      Turnus, ask of him to make me captain of his host, and Angeas did so, and he came unto his brother and his brother came to meet him, and he asked him after his welfare.</p>
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And Angeas asked his brother Lucus after his welfare, and to make his son Niblos captain of his host, and Lucus did so, and Angeas and his brother Lucus rose up and they went toward Turnus to battle, and there was with them a great army and a heavy people.</p>
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And he came in ships, and they came into the province of Ashtorash, and behold Turnus came toward them, for he went forth to Sardunia, and intended to destroy it and afterward to pass on from there to Angeas to fight with him.</p>
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And Angeas and Lucus his brother met Turnus in the valley of Canopia, and the battle was strong and mighty between them in that place.</p>
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And the battle was severe upon Lucus king of Sardunia, and all his army fell, and Niblos his son fell also in that battle.</p>
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And his uncle Angeas commanded his servants and they made a golden coffin for Niblos and they put him into it, and Angeas again waged battle toward Turnus, and Angeas was stronger than he, and he slew him, and he smote all his people with the edge of the sword, and Angeas avenged the cause of Niblos his brother's son and the cause of the army of his brother Lucus.</p>
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And when Turnus died, the hands of those that survived the battle became weak, and they fled from before Angeas and Lucus his brother.</p>
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And Angeas and his brother Lucus pursued them unto the highroad, which is between Alphanu and Romah, and they slew the whole army of Turnus with the edge of the sword.</p>
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And Lucus king of Sardunia commanded his servants that they should make a coffin of brass, and that they should place therein the body of his son Niblos, and they buried him in that place.</p>
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And they built upon it a high tower there upon the highroad, and they called its name after the name of Niblos unto this day, and they also buried Turnus king of Bibentu there in that place with Niblos.</p>
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And behold upon the highroad between Alphanu and Romah the grave of Niblos is on one side and the grave of Turnus on the other, and a pavement between them unto this day.</p>
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And when Niblos was buried, Lucus his father returned with his army to his land Sardunia, and Angeas his brother king of Africa went with his people unto the city of Bibentu, that is the city of Turnus.</p>
                      <p><sup>29</sup> And the inhabitants of Bibentu heard of his fame and they were greatly afraid of him, and they went forth to meet him with weeping and supplication, and the inhabitants of Bibentu entreated of Angeas not to slay them nor destroy their city; and he did so, for Bibentu was in those days reckoned as one of the cities of the children of Chittim; therefore he did not destroy the city.</p>
                      <p><sup>30</sup> But from that day forward the troops of the king of Africa would go to Chittim to spoil and plunder it, and whenever they went, Zepho the captain of the host of Angeas would go with them.</p>
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And it was after this that Angeas turned with his army and they came to the city of Puzimna, and Angeas took thence Jania the daughter of Uzu for a wife and brought her unto his city unto Africa.</p>
                   
                   
                    
        <H2>Chapter 3</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle">Petty Wars and contentions of the Nations of Africa with Zepho.</p>


                                 
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And it came to pass at that time Pharaoh king of Egypt commanded all his people to make for him a strong palace in Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And he also commanded the sons of Jacob to assist the Egyptians in the building, and the Egyptians made a beautiful and elegant palace for a royal habitation, and he dwelt therein and he renewed his government and he reigned securely.</p>
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And Zebulun the son of Jacob died in that year, that is the seventy-second year of the going down of the Israelites to Egypt, and Zebulun died a hundred and fourteen years old, and was put into a coffin and given into the hands of his children.</p>
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And in the seventy-fifth year died his brother Simeon, he was a hundred and twenty years old at his death, and he was also put into a coffin and given into the hands of his children.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And Zepho the son of Eliphaz the son of Esau, captain of the host to Angeas king of Dinhabah, was still daily enticing Angeas to prepare for battle to fight with the sons of Jacob in Egypt, and Angeas was unwilling to do this thing, for his servants had related to him all the might of the sons of Jacob, what they had done unto them in their battle with the children of Esau.</p>
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And Zepho was in those days daily enticing Angeas to fight with the sons of Jacob in those days.</p>
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And after some time Angeas hearkened to the words of Zepho and consented to him to fight with the sons of Jacob in Egypt, and Angeas got all his people in order, a people numerous as the sand which is upon the sea shore, and he formed his resolution to go to Egypt to battle.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And amongst the servants of Angeas was a youth fifteen years old, Balaam the son of Beor was his name and the youth was very wise and understood the art of witchcraft.</p>
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And Angeas said unto Balaam, Conjure for us, I pray thee, with the witchcraft, that we may know who will prevail in this battle to which we are now proceeding.</p>
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And Balaam ordered that they should bring him wax, and he made thereof the likeness of chariots and horsemen representing the army of Angeas and the army of Egypt, and he put them in the cunningly prepared waters that he had for that purpose, and he took in his hand
                      the boughs of myrtle trees, and he exercised his cunning, and he joined them over the water, and there appeared unto him in the water the resembling images of the hosts of Angeas falling before the resembling images of the Egyptians and the sons of Jacob.</p>
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And Balaam told this thing to Angeas, and Angeas despaired and did not arm himself to go down to Egypt to battle, and he remained in his city.</p>
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And when Zepho the son of Eliphaz saw that Angeas despaired of going forth to battle with the Egyptians, Zepho fled from Angeas from Africa, and he went and came unto Chittim.</p>
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And all the people of Chittim received him with great honor, and they hired him to fight their battles all the days, and Zepho became exceedingly rich in those days, and the troops of the king of Africa still spread themselves in those days, and the children of Chittim assembled and went to Mount Cuptizia on account of the troops of Angeas king of Africa, who were advancing upon them.</p>
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And it was one day that Zepho lost a young heifer, and he went to seek it, and he heard it lowing round about the mountain.</p>
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And Zepho went and he saw and behold there was a large cave at the bottom of the mountain, and there was a great stone there at the entrance of the cave, and Zepho split the stone and he came into the cave and he looked and behold, a large animal was devouring the ox; from the middle upward it resembled a man, and from the middle downward it resembled an animal, and Zepho rose up against the animal and slew it with his swords.</p>
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And the inhabitants of Chittim heard of this thing, and they rejoiced exceedingly, and they said, What shall we do unto this man who has slain this animal that devoured our cattle?</p>
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And they all assembled to consecrate one day in the year to him, and they called the name thereof Zepho after his name, and they brought unto him drink offerings year after year on that day, and they brought unto him gifts.</p>
                      <p><sup>18</sup> At that time Jania the daughter of Uzu wife of king Angeas became ill, and her illness was heavily felt by Angeas and his officers, and Angeas said unto his wise men, What shall I do to Jania and how shall I heal her from her illness? And his wise men said unto him, Because the air of our country is not like the air of the land of Chittim, and our water is not like their water, therefore from this has the queen become ill.</p>
                      <p><sup>19</sup> For through the change of air and water she became ill, and also because in her country she drank only the water which came from Purmah, which her ancestors had brought up with bridges.</p>
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And Angeas commanded his servants, and they brought unto him in vessels of the waters of Purmah belonging to Chittim, and they weighed those waters with all the waters of the land of Africa, and they found those waters lighter than the waters of Africa.</p>
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And Angeas saw this thing, and he commanded all his officers to assemble the hewers of stone in thousands and tens of thousands, and they hewed stone without number, and the builders came and they built an exceedingly strong bridge, and they conveyed the spring of water from the land of Chittim unto Africa, and those waters were for Jania the queen and for all her concerns, to drink from and to bake, wash and bathe therewith, and also to water therewith all seed from which food can be obtained, and all fruit of the ground.</p>
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And the king commanded that they should bring of the soil of Chittim in large ships, and they also brought stones to build therewith, and the builders built palaces for Jania the queen, and the queen became healed of her illness.</p>
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And at the revolution of the year the troops of Africa continued coming to the land of Chittim to plunder as usual, and Zepho son of Eliphaz heard their report, and he gave orders concerning them and he fought with them, and they fled before him, and he delivered the land
                      of Chittim from them.</p>
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And the children of Chittim saw the valor of Zepho, and the children of Chittim resolved and they made Zepho king over them, and he became king over them, and whilst he reigned they went to subdue the children of Tubal, and all the surrounding islands.</p>
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And their king Zepho went at their head and they made war with Tubal and the islands, and they subdued them, and when they returned from the battle they renewed his government for him, and they built for him a very large palace for his royal habitation and seat, and they made a large throne for him, and Zepho reigned over the whole land of Chittim and over the land of Italia fifty years.</p>
               


                    
        <H2>Chapter 4</H2>

                      <p><sup>1</sup> In that year, being the seventy-ninth year of the Israelites going down to Egypt, died Reuben the son of Jacob, in the land of Egypt; Reuben was a hundred and twenty-five years old when he died, and they put him into a coffin, and he was given into the hands of his children.</p>
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And in the eightieth year died his brother Dan; he was a hundred and twenty years at his death, and he was also put into a coffin and given into the hands of his children.</p>
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And in that year died Chusham king of Edom, and after him reigned Hadad the son of Bedad, for thirty-five years; and in the eighty-first year died Issachar the son of Jacob, in Egypt, and Issachar was a hundred and twenty-two years old at his death, and he was put
                      into a coffin in Egypt, and given into the hands of his children.</p>
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And in the eighty-second year died Asher his brother, he was a hundred and twenty-three years old at his death, and he was placed in a coffin in Egypt, and given into the hands of his children.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And in the eighty-third year died Gad, he was a hundred and twenty-five years old at his death, and he was put into a coffin in Egypt, and given into the hands of his children.</p>
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And it came to pass in the eighty-fourth year, that is the fiftieth year of the reign of Hadad, son of Bedad, king of Edom, that Hadad assembled all the children of Esau, and he got his whole army in readiness, about four hundred thousand men, and he directed his way to the
                      land of Moab, and he went to fight with Moab and to make them tributary to him.</p>
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And the children of Moab heard this thing, and they were very much afraid, and they sent to the children of Midian to assist them in fighting with Hadad, son of Bedad, king of Edom.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And Hadad came unto the land of Moab, and Moab and the children of Midian went out to meet him, and they placed themselves in battle array against him in the field of Moab.</p>
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And Hadad fought with Moab, and there fell of the children of Moab and the children of Midian many slain ones, about two hundred thousand men.</p>
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And the battle was very severe upon Moab, and when the children of Moab saw that the battle was sore upon them, they weakened their hands and turned their backs, and left the children of Midian to carry on the battle.</p>
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And the children of Midian knew not the intentions of Moab, but they strengthened themselves in battle and fought with Hadad and all his host, and all Midian fell before him.</p>
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And Hadad smote all Midian with a heavy smiting, and he slew them with the edge of the sword, he left none remaining of those who came to assist Moab.</p>
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And when all the children of Midian had perished in battle, and the children at Moab had escaped, Hadad made all Moab at that time tributary to him, and they became under his hand, and they gave a yearly tax as it was ordered, and Hadad turned and went back to his land.</p>
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And at the revolution of the year, when the rest of the people of Midian that were in the land heard that all their brethren had fallen in battle with Hadad for the sake of Moab, because the children of Moab had turned their backs in battle and left Midian to fight, then
                      five of the princes of Midian resolved with the rest of their brethren who remained in their land, to fight with Moab to avenge the cause of their brethren.</p>
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And the children of Midian sent to all their brethren the children of the east, and all their brethren, all the children of Keturah came to assist Midian to fight with Moab.</p>
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And the children of Moab heard this thing, and they were greatly afraid that all the children of the east had assembled together against them for battle, and they the children of Moab sent a memorial to the land of Edom to Hadad the son of Bedad, saying,</p>
                      <p><sup>17</sup> Come now unto us and assist us and we will smite Midian, for they all assembled together and have come against us with all their brethren the children of the east to battle, to avenge the cause of Midian that fell in battle.</p>
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And Hadad, son of Bedad, king of Edom, went forth with his whole army and went to the land of Moab to fight with Midian, and Midian and the children of the east fought with Moab in the field of Moab, and the battle was very fierce between them.</p>
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And Hadad smote all the children of Midian and the children of the east with the edge of the sword, and Hadad at that time delivered Moab from the hand of Midian, and those that remained of Midian and of the children of the east fled before Hadad and his army, and
                      Hadad pursued them to their land, and smote them with a very heavy slaughter, and the slain fell in the road.</p>
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And Hadad delivered Moab from the hand of Midian, for all the children of Midian had fallen by the edge of the sword, and Hadad turned and went back to his land.</p>
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And from that day forth, the children of Midian hated the children of Moab, because they had fallen in battle for their sake, and there was a great and mighty enmity between them all the days.</p>
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And all that were found of Midian in the road of the land of Moab perished by the sword of Moab, and all that were found of Moab in the road of the land of Midian, perished by the sword of Midian; thus did Midian unto Moab and Moab unto Midian for many days.</p>
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And it came to pass at that time that Judah the son of Jacob died in Egypt, in the eighty-sixth year of Jacob's going down to Egypt, and Judah was a hundred and twenty-nine years old at his death, and they embalmed him and put him into a coffin, and he was given into the hands of his children.</p>
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And in the eighty-ninth year died Naphtali, he was a hundred and thirty-two years old, and he was put into a coffin and given into the hands of his children.</p>
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And it came to pass in the ninety-first year of the Israelites going down to Egypt, that is in the thirtieth year of the reign of Zepho the son of Eliphaz, the son of Esau, over the children of Chittim, the children of Africa came upon the children of Chittim to plunder them as usual, but they had not come upon them for these thirteen years.</p>
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And they came to them in that year, and Zepho the son of Eliphaz went out to them with some of his men and smote them  desperately, and the troops of Africa fled from before Zepho and the slain fell before him, and Zepho and his men pursued them, going on and
                      smiting them until they were near unto Africa.</p>
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And Angeas king of Africa heard the thing which Zepho had done, and it vexed him exceedingly, and Angeas was afraid of Zepho all the days.</p>
                    


        <H2>Chapter 5</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle">Petty Wars and contentions of the Nations of Africa with Zepho.</p>

                       
                    
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And in the ninety-third year died Levi, the son of Jacob, in Egypt, and Levi was a hundred and thirty-seven years old when he died, and they put him into a coffin and he was given into the hands of his children.</p>
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And it came to pass after the death of Levi, when all Egypt saw that the sons of Jacob the brethren of Joseph were dead, all the Egyptians began to afflict the children of Jacob, and to embitter their lives from that day unto the day of their going forth from Egypt, and they took from their hands all the vineyards and fields which Joseph had given unto them, and all the elegant houses in which the people of Israel lived, and all the fat of Egypt, the Egyptians took all from the sons of Jacob in those days.</p>
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And the hand of all Egypt became more grievous in those days against the children of Israel, and the Egyptians injured the Israelites until the children of Israel were wearied of their lives on account of the Egyptians.</p>
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And it came to pass in those days, in the hundred and second year of Israel's going down to Egypt, that Pharaoh king of Egypt died, and Melol his son reigned in his stead, and all the mighty men of Egypt and all that generation which knew Joseph and his brethren died in
                      those days.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> And another generation rose up in their stead, which had not known the sons of Jacob and all the good which they had done to them, and all their might in Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>6</sup> Therefore all Egypt began from that day forth to embitter the lives of the sons of Jacob, and to afflict them with all manner of hard labor, because they had not known their ancestors who had delivered them in the days of the famine.</p>
                      <p><sup>7</sup> And this was also from the Lord, for the children of Israel, to benefit them in their latter days, in order that all the children of Israel might know the Lord their God.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> And in order to know the signs and mighty wonders which the Lord would do in Egypt on account of his people Israel, in order that the children of Israel might fear the Lord God of their ancestors, and walk in all his ways, they and their seed after them all the days.</p>
                      <p><sup>9</sup> Melol was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned ninety-four years, and all Egypt called his name Pharaoh after the name of his father, as it was their custom to do to every king who reigned over them in Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>10</sup> At that time all the troops of Angeas king of Africa went forth to spread along the land of Chittim as usual for plunder.</p>
                      <p><sup>11</sup> And Zepho the son of Eliphaz the son of Esau heard their report, and he went forth to meet them with his army, and he fought them there in the road.</p>
                      <p><sup>12</sup> And Zepho smote the troops of the king of Africa with the edge of the sword, and left none remaining of them, and not even one returned to his master in Africa.</p>
                      <p><sup>13</sup> And Angeas heard of this which Zepho the son of Eliphaz had done to all his troops, that he had destroyed them, and Angeas assembled all his troops, all the men of the land of Africa, a people numerous like the sand by the sea shore.</p>
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And Angeas sent to Lucus his brother, saying, Come to me with all thy men and help me to smite Zepho and all the children of Chittim who have destroyed my men, and Lucus came with his whole army, a very great force, to assist Angeas his brother to fight with Zepho and
                      the children of Chittim.</p>
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And Zepho and the children of Chittim heard this thing, and they were greatly afraid and a great terror fell upon their hearts.</p>
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And Zepho also sent a letter to the land of Edom to Hadad the son of Bedad king of Edom and to all the children of Esau, saying,</p>
                      <p><sup>17</sup> I have heard that Angeas king of Africa is coming to us with his brother for battle against us, and we are greatly afraid of him, for his army is very great, particularly as he comes against us with his brother and his army likewise.</p>
                      <p><sup>18</sup> Now therefore come you also up with me and help me, and we will fight together against Angeas and his brother Lucus, and you will save us out of their hands, but if not, know ye that we shall all die.</p>
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And the children of Esau sent a letter to the children of Chittim and to Zepho their king, saying, We cannot fight against Angeas and his people for a covenant of peace has been between us these many years, from the days of Bela the first king, and from the days of
                      Joseph the son of Jacob king of Egypt, with whom we fought on the other side of Jordan when he buried his father.</p>
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And when Zepho heard the words of his brethren the children of Esau he refrained from them, and Zepho was greatly afraid of Angeas.</p>
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And Angeas and Lucus his brother arrayed all their forces, about eight hundred thousand men, against the children of Chittim.</p>
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And all the children of Chittim said unto Zepho, Pray for us to the God of thy ancestors, peradventure he may deliver us from the hand of Angeas and his army, for we have heard that he is a great God and that he delivers all who trust in him.</p>
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And Zepho heard their words, and Zepho sought the Lord and he said,</p> 
                      <p><sup>24</sup> 0 Lord God of Abraham and Isaac my ancestors, this day I know that thou art a true God, and all the gods of the nations are vain and useless.</p>
                      <p><sup>25</sup> Remember now this day unto me thy covenant with Abraham our father, which our ancestors related unto us, and do graciously with me this day for the sake of Abraham and Isaac our fathers, and save me and the children of Chittim from the hand of the king of Africa who comes against us for battle.</p>
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Zepho, and he had regard for him on account of Abraham and Isaac, and the Lord delivered Zepho and the children of Chittim from the hand of Angeas and his people.</p>
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And Zepho fought Angeas king of Africa and all his people on that day, and the Lord gave all the people of Angeas into the hands of the children of Chittim.</p>
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And the battle was severe upon Angeas, and Zepho smote all the men of Angeas and Lucus his brother, with the edge of the sword, and there fell from them unto the evening of that day about four hundred thousand men.</p>
                      <p><sup>29</sup> And when Angeas saw that all his men perished, he sent a letter to all the inhabitants of Africa to come to him, to assist him in the battle, and he wrote in the letter, saying, All who are found in Africa let them come unto me from ten years old and upward; let them all come unto me, and behold if he comes not he shall die, and all that he has, with his whole household, the king will take.</p>
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And all the rest of the inhabitants of Africa were terrified at the words of Angeas, and there went out of the city about three hundred thousand men and boys, from ten years upward, and they came to Angeas.</p>
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And at the end of ten days Angeas renewed the battle against Zepho and the children of Chittim, and the battle was very great and strong between them.</p>
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And from the army of Angeas and Lucus, Zepho sent many of the wounded unto his hand, about two thousand men, and Sosiphtar the captain of the host of Angeas fell in that battle.</p>
                      <p><sup>33</sup> And when Sosiphtar had fallen, the African troops turned their backs to flee, and they fled, and Angeas and Lucus his brother were with them.</p>
                      <p><sup>34</sup> And Zepho and the children of Chittim pursued them, and they smote them still heavily on the road, about two hundred men, and they pursued Azdrubal the son of Angeas who had fled with his father, and they smote twenty of his men in the road, and Azdrubal escaped from
                      the children of Chittim, and they did not slay him.</p>
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And Angeas and Lucus his brother fled with the rest of their men, and they escaped and came into Africa with terror and consternation, and Angeas feared all the days lest Zepho the son of Eliphaz should go to war with him.</p>
         


        <H2>Chapter 6</H2> 
        <p class="chapterTitle"> Zepho Leads a Great Army of Chittimites, Edomites, and Ishmaelites against Egypt. Three Hundred Thousand Egyptians put to Flight, but One Hundred and Fifty Men of Israel prevail against Zepho.</p>

   
                    
                      <p><sup>1</sup> And Balaam the son of Beor was at that time with Angeas in the battle, and when he saw that Zepho prevailed over Angeas, he fled from there and came to Chittim.</p>
                      <p><sup>2</sup> And Zepho and the children of Chittim received him with great honor, for Zepho knew Balaam's wisdom, and Zepho gave unto Balaam many gifts and he remained with him.</p>
                      <p><sup>3</sup> And when Zepho had returned from the war, he commanded all the children of Chittim to be numbered who had gone into battle with him, and behold not one was missed.</p>
                      <p><sup>4</sup> And Zepho rejoiced at this thing, and he renewed his kingdom, and he made a feast to all his subjects.</p>
                      <p><sup>5</sup> But Zepho remembered not the Lord and considered not that the Lord had helped him in battle, and that he had delivered him and his people from the hand of the king of Africa, but still walked in the ways of the children of Chittim and the wicked children of Esau, to serve
                      other gods which his brethren the children of Esau had taught him; it is therefore said, From the wicked goes forth wickedness.</p>
                      <p><sup>6</sup> And Zepho reigned over all the children of Chittim securely, but knew not the Lord who had delivered him and all his people from the hand of the king of Africa; and the troops of Africa came no more to Chittim to plunder as usual, for they knew of the power of Zepho who had
                      smitten them all at the edge of the sword, so Angeas was afraid of Zepho the son of Eliphaz, and of the children of Chittim all the days.</p>
                      <p><sup>7</sup> At that time when Zepho had returned from the war, and when Zepho had seen how he prevailed over all the people of Africa and had smitten them in battle at the edge of the sword, then Zepho advised with the children of Chittim, to go to Egypt to fight with the sons of Jacob
                      and with Pharaoh king of Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>8</sup> For Zepho heard that the mighty men of Egypt were dead and that Joseph and his brethren the sons at Jacob were dead, and that all their children the children of Israel remained in Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>9</sup> And Zepho considered to go to fight against them and all Egypt, to avenge the cause of his brethren the children of Esau, whom Joseph with his brethren and all Egypt had smitten in the land of Canaan, when they went up to bury Jacob in Hebron.</p>
                      <p><sup>10</sup> And Zepho sent messengers to Hadad, son of Bedad, king of Edom, and to all his brethren the children of Esau, saying,</p>
                      <p><sup>11</sup> Did you not say that you would not fight against the king of Africa for he is a member of your covenant? behold I fought with him and smote him and all his people.</p>
                      <p><sup>12</sup> Now therefore I have resolved to fight against Egypt and the children of Jacob who are there, and I will be revenged of them for what Joseph, his brethren and ancestors did to us in the land of Canaan when they went up to bury their father in Hebron.</p>
                      <p><sup>13</sup> Now then if you are willing to come to me to assist me in fighting against them and Egypt, then shall we avenge the cause of our brethren.</p>
                      <p><sup>14</sup> And the children of Esau hearkened to the words of Zepho, and the children of Esau gathered themselves together, a very great people, and they went to assist Zepho and the children of Chittim in battle.</p>
                      <p><sup>15</sup> And Zepho sent to all the children of the east and to all the children of Ishmael with words like unto these, and they gathered themselves and came to the assistance of Zepho and the children of Chittim in the war upon Egypt.</p>
                      <p><sup>16</sup> And all these kings, the king of Edom and the children of the east, and all the children of Ishmael, and Zepho the king of Chittim went forth and arrayed all their hosts in Hebron.</p>
                      <p><sup>17</sup> And the camp was very heavy, extending in length a distance of three days' journey, a people numerous as the sand upon the sea shore which can not be counted.</p>
                      <p><sup>18</sup> And all these kings and their hosts went down and came against all Egypt in battle, and encamped together in the valley of Pathros.</p>
                      <p><sup>19</sup> And all Egypt heard their report, and they also gathered themselves together, all the people of the land of Egypt, and of all the cities belonging to Egypt, about three hundred thousand men.</p>
                      <p><sup>20</sup> And the men of Egypt sent also to the children of Israel who were in those days in the land of Goshen, to come to them in order to go and fight with these kings.</p>
                      <p><sup>21</sup> And the men of Israel assembled and were about one hundred and fifty men, and they went into battle to assist the Egyptians.</p>
                      <p><sup>22</sup> And the men of Israel and of Egypt went forth, about three hundred thousand men and one hundred and fifty men, and they went toward these kings to battle, and they placed themselves from without the land of Goshen opposite Pathros.</p>
                      <p><sup>23</sup> And the Egyptians believed not in Israel to go with them in their camps together for battle, for all the Egyptians said, Perhaps the children of Israel will deliver us into the hand of the children of Esau and Ishmael, for they are their brethren.</p>
                      <p><sup>24</sup> And all the Egyptians said unto the children of Israel, Remain you here together in your stand and we will go and fight against the children of Esau and Ishmael, and if these kings should prevail over us, then come you altogether upon them and assist us, and the children
                      of Israel did so.</p>
                      <p><sup>25</sup> And Zepho the son of Eliphaz the son of Esau king of Chittim, and Hadad the son of Bedad king of Edom, and all their camps, and all the children of the east, and children of Ishmael, a people numerous as sand, encamped together in the valley of Pathros opposite Tachpanches.</p>
                      <p><sup>26</sup> And Balaam the son of Beor the Syrian was there in the camp of Zepho, for he came with the children of Chittim to the battle, and Balaam was a man highly honored in the eyes of Zepho and his men.</p>
                      <p><sup>27</sup> And Zepho said unto Balaam, Try by divination for us that we may know who will prevail in the battle, we or the Egyptians.</p>
                      <p><sup>28</sup> And Balaam rose up and tried the art of divination, and he was skillful in the knowledge of it, but he was confused and the work was destroyed in his hand.</p>
                      <p><sup>29</sup> And he tried it again but it did not succeed, and Balaam despaired of it and left it and did not complete it, for this was from the Lord, in order to cause Zepho and his people to fall into the hand of the children of Israel, who had trusted in the Lord, the God of their ancestors, in their war.</p>
                      <p><sup>30</sup> And Zepho and Hadad put their forces in battle array, and all the Egyptians went alone against them, about three hundred  thousand men, and not one man of Israel was with them.</p>
                      <p><sup>31</sup> And all the Egyptians fought with these kings opposite Pathros and Tachpanches, and the battle was severe against the Egyptians.</p>
                      <p><sup>32</sup> And the kings were stronger than the Egyptians in that battle, and about one hundred and eighty men of Egypt fell on that day, and about thirty men of the forces of the kings, and all the men of Egypt fled from before the kings, so the children of Esau and Ishmael pursued the Egyptians, continuing to smite them unto the place where was the camp of the children of Israel.</p>
                      <p><sup>33</sup> And all the Egyptians cried unto the children of Israel, saying, Hasten to us and assist us and save us from the hand of Esau, Ishmael and the children of Chittim.</p>
                      <p><sup>34</sup> And the hundred and fifty men of the children of Israel ran from their station to the camps of these kings, and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord their God to deliver them.</p>
                      <p><sup>35</sup> And the Lord hearkened to Israel, and the Lord gave all the men of the kings into their hand, and the children of Israel fought against these kings, and the children of Israel smote about four thousand of the kings' men.</p>
                      <p><sup>36</sup> And the Lord threw a great consternation in the camp of the kings, so that the fear of the children of Israel fell upon them.</p>
                      <p><sup>37</sup> And all the hosts of the kings fled from before the children of Israel and the children of Israel pursued them continuing to smite them unto the borders of the land of Cush.</p>
                      <p><sup>38</sup> And the children of Israel slew of them in the road yet two thousand men, and of the children of Israel not one fell.</p>
                      <p><sup>39</sup> And when the Egyptians saw that the children of Israel had fought with such few men with the kings, and that the battle was so very severe against them,</p>
                      <p><sup>40</sup> All the Egyptians were greatly afraid of their lives on account of the strong battle, and all Egypt fled, every man hiding himself from the arrayed forces, and they hid themselves in the road, and they left the Israelites to fight.</p>
                      <p><sup>41</sup> And the children of Israel inflicted a terrible blow upon the kings' men, and they returned from them after they had driven them to the border of the land of Cush.</p>
                      <p><sup>42</sup> And all Israel knew the thing which the men of Egypt had done to them, that they had fled from them in battle, and had left them to fight alone.</p>
                      <p><sup>43</sup> So the children of Israel also acted with cunning, and as the children of Israel returned from battle, they found some of the Egyptians in the road and smote them there.</p>
                      <p><sup>44</sup> And whilst they slew them, they said unto them these words:</p> 
                      <p><sup>45</sup> Wherefore did you go from us and leave us, being a few people, to fight against these kings who had a great people to smite us, that you might thereby deliver your own souls?</p>
                      <p><sup>46</sup> And of some which the Israelites met on the road, they the children of Israel spoke to each other, saying, Smite, smite, for he is an Ishmaelite, or an Edomite, or from the children of Chittim, and they stood over him and slew him, and they knew that he was an Egyptian.</p>
                      <p><sup>47</sup> And the children of Israel did these things cunningly against the Egyptians, because they had deserted them in battle and had fled from them.</p>
                      <p><sup>48</sup> And the children of Israel slew of the men of Egypt in the road in this manner, about two hundred men.</p>
                      <p><sup>49</sup> And all the men of Egypt saw the evil which the children of Israel had done to them, so all Egypt feared greatly the children of Israel, for they had seen their great power, and that not one man of them had fallen.</p>
                      <p><sup>50</sup> So all the children of Israel returned with joy on their road to Goshen, and the rest of Egypt returned each man to his place.</p>
