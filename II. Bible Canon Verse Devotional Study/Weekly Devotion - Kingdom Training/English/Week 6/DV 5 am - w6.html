      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>John 16:33</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
      
      <p>           
        <sup>33</sup>  I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have [perfect] peace. In the world you have tribulation and distress and suffering, but be courageous [be confident, be undaunted, be filled with joy]; I have overcome the world.” [My conquest is accomplished, My victory abiding.]
      </p>

      <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>


      <p>The "peace" Jesus talks about is not worldly comfort or even happiness. It is the confident "rest" believers feel when they let go of anxiety and trust God to carry out His will.<br><br>

        As is common in both ancient literature and biblical prophecy, Jesus speaks of something guaranteed by God as if it has already happened. Before this Last Supper, Christ overcame the temptations of human life and the direct lures of Satan. The greater victory, however, will come after His arrest and crucifixion when He is raised from the dead.<br><br>
        
        Several times during the Last Supper, Jesus stressed that He is intentionally giving advance warnings. His clear purpose is to offer encouragement; instead of reacting with fear or confusion, Christians should recognize that these experiences are part of God's greater plan. The book of Hebrews, especially chapter 11, honors heroes of the faith who chose to "hold fast" and trust in God. Scripture shows that their trust was well-placed, even if God's promises were fulfilled after those believers had passed into eternity.<br><br>
        
        Christ's words, as recorded in the Gospel of John, are deeply treasured. This passage blends teaching, remembrance, warning, and encouragement. Being a Christian doesn't mean life will be easy. Jesus made it clear that following Him can lead to persecution. The joy of genuine believers comes from knowing that Christ has already won the ultimate victory, and nothing in this world can change that. Knowing that Christ warned us ahead of time about hardships should reassure believers that these situations do not catch God off guard.<br><br>
        
        
        <b>Words of Encouragement to All Who Believe:</b><br><br>
        
        Jesus says, "I have overcome the world." In a world filled with tribulation, trial, temptation, sin, sorrow, suffering, evil, and injustice, we experience the effects of these constantly. Jesus acknowledges this reality, saying, "You will have tribulation in this world. Don’t be surprised by it, but I speak peace into the middle of that. Take heart, I have come because I have overcome the world."<br><br>
        
        Jesus has come to conquer. Just after saying these words, He went to the cross where, as the Bible says, He disarmed the rulers and authorities of this world. They are no longer armed. Jesus has taken the sting out of sin and death.<br><br>
        
        For those who believe and trust in Him completely, without reservation, He has promised to give His Spirit to all who come to Him and make Him the ruler of their whole being. The resurrected, overcoming King of Kings and Lord of Lords will dwell within you.<br><br>
        
        So no matter what you face, no matter the trials or tribulations surrounding you, you will never walk with your head down. With His guidance, you will live as a victorious and ever-conquering individual in the midst of darkness.<br><br>
        
        You will never experience defeat when the King of Kings resides in you. He will be with you the moment you give everything up for Him, and He will stay with you even into eternity.<br><br>
        
        Lift up your eyes and look to Him, for He is your hope, your help, and your strength. He is your joy and peace. He is your victory, and He is the one who has overcome and will help you overcome the sin that tempts you, the struggles you walk through, and the trials and tribulations you face.<br><br>
        
        Take heart for the remaining three devotions this week, as this truth will be the key to receiving all of God's promises in your life. This truth will teach you how to have God's Spirit reside in you. Once His Spirit dwells within you, it will be your seal for salvation and guarantee your entry into the Kingdom of God.<br><br>
        
        So take heart and approach these devotions with seriousness and dedication. Pray today that you will receive God's gifts through these last three devotions this week.
        
        Pray to God now with an expectant heart for all that He will do in your life. Amen.
