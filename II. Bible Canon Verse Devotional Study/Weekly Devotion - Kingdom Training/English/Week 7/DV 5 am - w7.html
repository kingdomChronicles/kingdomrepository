  <p class="SCQoute" style="font-size: 28px;">Who was Israel to God?</p>

  <h2>Deuteronomy 7:6</h2>
  <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>

  <p><b>
    <sup>6</sup> For you are a holy people [set apart] to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be a people for His own possession [that is, His very special treasure]. 
  </b></p>

<p>Israel was God's chosen nation, His treasured possession. They were selected to demonstrate how a people should live in obedience to God's righteousness on earth. As a set-apart nation, Israel was intended to uphold and implement God's laws and will, serving as an example of faithfulness and devotion to the rest of the world.<br><br>

    In return for their obedience and devotion, God displayed great and mighty acts to save Israel from bondage under the powerful nation of Egypt. The miraculous events of the Exodus, including the parting of the Red Sea and the provision of manna in the desert, demonstrated God's power and His commitment to His chosen people. When Israel entered the land of Canaan, God continued to perform mighty miracles, ensuring their victory over stronger nations and providing them with a land flowing with milk and honey. These miracles were countless, each a testament to God's unwavering love and favor towards Israel.<br><br>
    
    Despite being chosen and favored by God among all the nations of the earth, Israel repeatedly rebelled against Him. They turned away from His commandments, worshipped other gods, and neglected the covenant they had made. This rebellion was not a mere lapse but a pattern of disobedience and ingratitude, reflecting their failure to fully embrace the divine purpose for which they were chosen.
    </p>

  <p><b>Read the following verses that describe how the Israelites sinned against God.</b></p>

  <h2>Isaiah 1:2-17</h2>
  <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>

  <p>
    <sup>2</sup> Hear me, you heavens! Listen, earth! For the Lord has spoken: “I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. <br>
    <sup>3</sup> The ox knows its master, the donkey its owner’s manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.” <br>
    <sup>4</sup> Woe to the sinful nation, a people whose guilt is great, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the Lord; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. <br>
    <sup>5</sup> Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. <br>
    <sup>6</sup> From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness— only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with olive oil. <br>
    <sup>7</sup> Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. <br>
    <sup>8</sup> Daughter Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a city under siege. <br>
    <sup>9</sup> Unless the Lord Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. <br>
    <sup>10</sup> Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the instruction of our God, you people of Gomorrah! <br>
    <sup>11</sup> “The multitude of your sacrifices— what are they to me?” says the Lord. “I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. <br>
    <sup>12</sup> When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? <br>
    <sup>13</sup> Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations— I cannot bear your worthless assemblies. <br>
    <sup>14</sup> Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals I hate with all my being. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. <br>
    <sup>15</sup> When you spread out your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you; even when you offer many prayers, I am not listening. Your hands are full of blood! <br>
    <sup>16</sup> Wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight; stop doing wrong. <br>
    <sup>17</sup> Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow. 
  </p> <br><br>

  

  <p>In the following verses, the universe is called to witness a trial with God as the Judge, and Judah and Jerusalem as the defendants. The accusation is against the people of Israel, described as rebellious sons against God.<br><br>

    Observe the transgressions of the nation from verses 4 to 15. Do you see similar transgressions in your own nation?<br><br>
    
    We have seen what happened to Israel: the entire nation was punished for their rebellion, and God scattered them among the nations.<br><br>
    
    Israel's story is both a profound illustration of God's grace and a cautionary tale about the consequences of rebellion. Their journey from miraculous deliverance to persistent defiance underscores the complexities of human nature and the challenges of faithfulness. <i>It also serves as a reminder that being chosen by God is both a privilege and a responsibility, requiring continual dedication to His will.</i><br><br>
    
    In conclusion, Israel's unique position as God's chosen nation came with immense blessings and significant responsibilities. Their history highlights the importance of obedience to God and the dangers of turning away from His guidance. While their rebellion brought consequences, the overarching narrative of Israel is one of God's enduring love and mercy, constantly calling His people back to Him.<br><br>

    Let's delve deeper into why Israel faced chastisement and incurred God's wrath on our succeeding devotions.<br><br>

    Offer your prayer now as you conclude your morning devotion.</p>
