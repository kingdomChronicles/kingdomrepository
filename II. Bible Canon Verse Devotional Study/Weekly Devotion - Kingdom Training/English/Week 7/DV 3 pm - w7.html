      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

          <h2>Isaiah 53:12</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle"> ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
                <p>
                  <sup>12</sup> Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors.
                </p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><i>As we continue our devotional series on the 700-year prophecy about the coming Messiah from the book of Isaiah, we reflect on a profound verse that sheds light on Jesus' demeanor and purpose. </i><br><br><br>

                <b>The Reward of the Suffering Servant</b><br><br>

                This verse encapsulates the profound truth of the Messiah's reward for His ultimate humility and sacrifice. The imagery used here is that of a triumphant conqueror dividing the spoils after a victorious battle. This verse, rich with prophetic significance, points to the future glorification of Christ and His eternal victory over sin and death.<br><br>

                <b>The Messiah's Reward for His Humiliation</b><br><br>

                The passage depicts the Messiah, Jesus Christ, being rewarded by God for His willingness to endure humiliation and death. The reward is portrayed as a division of spoils, symbolizing the honor and glory that follow His sacrificial act. This metaphor reflects the victorious nature of Christ's mission—defeating sin and death through His suffering and resurrection.<br><br>

                <b>The Future Glorification of Christ</b><br><br>

                Numerous scriptures foretell the future glorification of Christ. The Book of Philippians, for example, declares that every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Similarly, the Epistle to the Hebrews asserts that God has placed all things under Christ’s feet. These passages affirm the ultimate recognition and honor that Christ will receive for His redemptive work.<br><br>

                <b>Christ's Ongoing Intercession</b><br><br>

                It's crucial to recognize that Christ's work did not cease at the cross. Presently, He continues to intercede for humanity. This ongoing advocacy underscores His enduring commitment to His people. As our high priest, Jesus constantly presents our needs before the Father, ensuring that His sacrifice remains efficacious for all who believe.<br><br>

                <b>The Glory from Suffering and Humiliation</b><br><br>

                The sufferings and humiliation of Jesus serve to amplify His glory and majesty. As Charles Spurgeon eloquently noted, Christ transformed the "dunghill of sin" into a "diamond of his glory" through our salvation. Without sinners, there would be no Savior. Without sin, there would be no need for the pouring out of His soul unto death. And without this ultimate sacrifice, there would be no divine act of expiation.
                <br><br>

                Spurgeon further emphasized that the wondrous act of expiation reveals the Godhead more gloriously than all creations and providences of divine power and wisdom combined. Christ’s atoning work stands as the pinnacle of God's revelation, showcasing His infinite love, mercy, and justice.
                <br><br>

                <b>Conclusion:</b><br><br>

                As we reflect on the suffering servant depicted in Isaiah 53, we witness God's profound love and redemptive plan proclaimed centuries before its fulfillment. This prophecy, written 700 years before Christ's birth, highlights the eternal significance of Jesus' sacrifice and His ongoing role as our intercessor.
                <br><br>

                <b>Application for Believers</b><br><br>

               <b> A. Believe:</b><br>
                If you have not yet believed, now is the time to place your faith in Jesus Christ. His sacrifice was for you, and accepting Him brings eternal life and reconciliation with God.<br><br>

               <b> B. Gratitude:</b><br>
                Express your gratitude by acknowledging Jesus' exalted position in your heart. Say "thank you" and let Him be "high and lifted up" in your life.<br><br>

               <b> C. Live Out Your Gratitude:</b><br>
                Jesus gave His life as a ransom for you. Your life is no longer your own; you were bought with a price. Live sacrificially, giving yourself to Him as a living sacrifice, free from selfishness.<br><br>

               <b> D. Follow His Example:</b><br>
                Emulate Christ’s humility, submission to the Father, and self-sacrificial love. Even in the face of suffering, follow His example of enduring faithfulness and love for others.<br><br>

                Isaiah 53:12 reveals the depth of Christ's love and the immeasurable glory that comes from His sacrifice. As believers, we are called to respond with faith, gratitude, and a commitment to live out the principles of humility and self-sacrifice exemplified by our Savior. In doing so, we honor the profound work of redemption accomplished by Jesus Christ and participate in His eternal victory.<br><br>

                <i>
                As the establishment of God's Kingdom on earth in the Last Days approaches, God's reign will be realized through His chosen children.<br><br>

                The question is: Are you ready to obey God's instruction, embrace His divine purpose, and dedicate yourself to advancing His Kingdom on earth?<br><br>
                
                If your answer is <b>YES</b>, you want to be part of those advancing God's Kingdom.<br><br>
                
                In your reflection, include the phrase: <u>"Yes, I want to obey whatever God instructs me to do."</u> A separate meeting will be held for all who accept the challenge to serve God at a higher level in His Kingdom. This meeting will address various aspects of the work needed to continue expanding His Kingdom on earth.</i></p>
