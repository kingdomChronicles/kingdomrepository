                <h2>John 10:25-29</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
                <p>  
                    <sup>25</sup> Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name bear witness about me, 
                    <sup>26</sup> but you do not believe because you are not among my sheep. 
                    <sup>27</sup> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 
                    <sup>28</sup> I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. 
                    <sup>29</sup> My Father, who has given them to me,is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>



                <p><b><sup>25</sup> Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name bear witness about me, </b> <br><br>

                    Jesus answers that he has already told them, and the works he has done in his Father’s name serve as evidence for him. <br><br>

                    Let's apply Jesus' words here. Many times, God speaks to us through His words, but often we just listen and never take action. <br><br>

                    Let's not merely hear His words and remain in a passive listening mode without taking any action. <br><br>

                    Let's not delude ourselves, particularly those who attend church, believing that simply by going to worship, they are cleansed and forgiven. It is even worse when they are prepared to return to their sinful ways for the rest of the week until the next religious gathering, thinking they will be cleansed once more. What a foolish belief. <br><br>

                    God is urging us to change our understanding of His ways. Let's resist conforming to the actions of those around us. </p> <br>
             

                <p><b><sup>26</sup> but you do not believe because you are not among my sheep. </b> <br><br>
                
                    Our God took on human form to reveal the Father and offer salvation to all who believe, listen, and obey His words. <br><br>
                
                    If you only listen to ease your conscience that you have fulfilled your religious duties, be afraid, because the opportunity for salvation is not always available to humanity. The outcome of Jesus' arrival in the world is that those who do not believe will face judgment. </p> <br>

                <p><b><sup>27</sup> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</b> <br><br>
                    
                    Every day, we encounter numerous voices. Some offer prescribed religious experiences to help us draw nearer to God. Others beckon us to join their group, religion, or sect. Still others teach that we can approach God by attaining higher knowledge, morality, or by performing good deeds. <br><br>

                    Among the many voices clamoring for our attention, some claiming to speak for God, His sheep hear His voice. If you are one of His sheep, you hear Him now. He is calling you to come home to Him. He is telling you to follow Him. <br><br>

                    Everything you need is already written in His words. Before, you didn't know Him, and you couldn't hear Him because you were constantly rejecting and neglecting His written words. <br><br>
                
                    This is never a coincidence; He is calling you now to come back to Him.</p> <br>

                <p><b><sup>28</sup> I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</b> <br><br>
                
                    The Good Shepherd teaches us that everything hinges on His Words; if you are His sheep, then you belong to Him. Our standing before God is never based on our feelings, experiences, doubts, or accomplishments. It depends solely on one thing: being known by the shepherd: “My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish.” Just allow the process to continue as you get to know Him better through His written Words. <br><br>
                
                    The Good Shepherd's voice sets us free instead of making us feel trapped. It doesn't demand, "Do this, and maybe you'll be good enough to be one of my sheep." Instead, it assures, "You already belong to me. No one can take you away from me." With this assurance, we are free to live the full and satisfying life that Jesus promised: "I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly." <br><br>

                    The abundant life that Jesus talks about isn't primarily about having a long life, wealth, status, or achievements. It's a life rich in the love of God revealed in Jesus Christ, a love that overflows to others. This life is eternal because its source is in God, who is eternal, and in Jesus, who is the resurrection and the life. <br><br>

                    Among all the other voices that instill fear, issue demands, or offer advice, the voice of the good shepherd stands out as a voice of promise. It is a voice that calls us by name and declares us as belonging to Him. </p>
