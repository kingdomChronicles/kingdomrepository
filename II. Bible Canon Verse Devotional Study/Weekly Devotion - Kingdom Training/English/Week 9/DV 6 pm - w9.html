      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>John 12:48</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
      <p> 
         
        <sup>29</sup>  Whoever rejects Me and refuses to accept My teachings, has one who judges him; the very word that I spoke will judge and condemn him on the last day.

      <p><b>More Knowledge, Greater Accountability</b><br><br>

        In the spiritual realm and in everyday life, the principle of responsibility for what we know and have been entrusted with is a fundamental truth. Several passages from the Bible articulate this principle clearly, and one of the most striking is found in John 12:48 (NLT): <i>"But all who reject me and my message will be judged on the day of judgment by the truth I have spoken."</i> This verse underscores the seriousness of rejecting the knowledge of Christ and His teachings. Alongside John 12:48, two additional verses further emphasize the idea of accountability:<br><br>
        
       <i>"The Lord our God has secrets known to no one. We are not accountable for them, but we and our children are accountable forever for all that he has revealed to us, so that we may obey all the terms of these instructions." </i> (Deuteronomy 29:29, NLT)<br><br>
        
       <i>"When someone has been given much, much will be required in return; and when someone has been entrusted with much, even more will be required." </i> (Luke 12:48, NLT)<br><br>
        
        These verses highlight the concept that with greater knowledge and blessing comes greater responsibility. <br><br>
        
        <b>The Context of Deuteronomy 29:29</b><br><br>
        
        In Deuteronomy, Moses delivers a farewell address to the Israelites as he anticipates his death. He reviews Israel's history since the Exodus, highlighting God's covenant with His people and reminding them of their responsibilities. Moses emphasizes the sovereignty of God and how it undergirds every aspect of Israel's relationship with Him. The Israelites are accountable for obeying God's commands because they have been given a specific revelation of God’s character and His saving grace.<br><br>
        
        Although the Israelites had much to learn about their covenant with God, what they did know and understand held them accountable—not just in the present but for eternity. This highlights an important principle: we are not held accountable for what we do not know, but we are eternally accountable for what has been revealed to us.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Lesson from Luke 12:48</b><br><br>
        
        In Luke, Jesus uses a parable to illustrate the end-of-age expectations of His followers. He contrasts two servants: one who faithfully manages his master's household and another who behaves irresponsibly in the master's absence. The conclusion of the parable underscores that those entrusted with more responsibility are held to a higher standard of accountability.<br><br>
        
        This teaching illustrates that in our Spiritual journey, as we grow in knowledge and understanding of God's will, we are entrusted with more opportunities to serve Him. With this increased responsibility comes a demand for a higher standard of behavior and obedience. Those who are given much in God’s Kingdom are expected to live according to a higher calling and bear greater accountability.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Significance of John 12:48</b><br><br>
        
        John 12:48 serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of rejecting Christ and His message. Jesus' words in this passage emphasize that judgment will be based on the truth He has spoken. This means that the knowledge of Christ and His teachings is not merely academic; it is a revelation that demands a response.<br><br>
        
        Rejecting Jesus’ message is not just a passive act; it is a decision with eternal implications. The truth of Christ is a gift that requires acknowledgment and acceptance. Those who choose to ignore or reject it are accountable for their decision.<br><br>
        
        
        <b>Applying the Principle of Accountability</b><br><br>
        
        The biblical principle of accountability extends beyond the spiritual realm and into every aspect of our lives—our families, jobs, businesses, and civic affairs. In each of these areas, more responsibility demands greater accountability.<br><br>
        
        <b><i>1. Family:</i></b> As parents and guardians, we have a responsibility to use our knowledge of nurturing and raising children to act in their best interests by adhering to biblical principles and setting an example of love, discipline, and integrity.<br><br>
        
        <b><i>2. Work:</i></b> In our jobs, we are called to use our skills and talents to perform our duties with diligence and excellence, as we serve God through our work and make positive contributions to our workplaces.<br><br>
        
        <b><i>3. Community:</i></b> As citizens, our understanding of civic responsibilities compels us to actively engage in our communities, promoting justice, equity, and compassion, while also sharing the message of God's love with everyone.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Call to Action</b><br><br>
        
        As believers, we are personally accountable for our knowledge of God. When we receive a revelation of God's grace, we are eternally accountable for it. The more we know and learn about God, the more He reveals Himself to us, the more accountable we are for living out His will in our lives. This understanding leaves no room for complacency or retreat.<br><br>
        
        1. Once we have been entrusted with the knowledge of God, there is no turning back. We cannot unlearn the truths we have received or ignore the responsibilities they bring.<br><br>
        
        2. The journey of faith is lifelong. We are called to persevere, continually growing in our understanding and commitment to God’s will.<br><br>
        
        3. Our actions and decisions matter. We are accountable for how we respond to God’s revelation in our lives.<br><br>
        
        4. There are no shortcuts to fulfilling our responsibilities. God expects us to engage fully and faithfully with the tasks He has given us.<br><br>
        
        God does not retract His gifts or revelations; instead, He continues to give us more. However, with each new revelation comes an increased responsibility to share it with others. Our knowledge of God is not for personal satisfaction alone but to fulfill God’s purpose in revealing Himself to us. He desires that we take personal responsibility to share His grace and truth with others, allowing Him to reveal Himself and His saving grace to them.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        The principle of “more knowledge, greater accountability” is a profound truth that governs both our spiritual and earthly lives. As God reveals Himself to us, He calls us to take on greater responsibility, both to live out His will and to share His truth with others.<br><br>
        
        In 2 Corinthians 5:11, Paul writes, <i>“Because we understand our fearful responsibility to the Lord, we work hard to persuade others. God knows we are sincere, and I hope you know this, too.”</i> This verse encapsulates the urgency and importance of our task. As we grow in knowledge and understanding of God, let us embrace our responsibility to live out our faith with integrity and to share the good news of Jesus with a world that desperately needs it.<br><br>
        
        
        In summary, everything we have learned from our Daily Devotion holds us eternally accountable. We will be judged based on whether we have followed and lived according to the teachings we have received. Our spiritual journey is a dynamic process that involves acquiring knowledge and taking responsible action based on that knowledge. Each revelation of God's truth invites us to deepen our faith and embrace greater responsibility, shaping us into faithful stewards of His word and ambassadors of His kingdom. Let us approach this calling with humility and dedication, knowing that our actions carry eternal significance.</p><br><br>
