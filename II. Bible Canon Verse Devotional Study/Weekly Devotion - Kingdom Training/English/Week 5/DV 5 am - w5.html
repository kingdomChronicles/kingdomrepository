      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>Matthew 4:17</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
      
      <p>           
        <sup>17</sup>  From that time Jesus began to preach and say, “Repent [change your inner self—your old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves repentance; seek God’s purpose for your life], for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” 
      </p>



      <br><hr>
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

    <p>When John the Baptist was preaching, he said to the people of Israel:
        "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near." <br><br>
        
        John the Baptist was sent to announce the arrival of Jesus. <br><br>
        
        There is a difference, though. John preached this message to Israel as the one who prepared the way for the coming of the King-Messiah. He called the people to get ready before the King-Messiah arrived and established the kingdom of heaven on earth. <br><br>
        
        Jesus preached the same message, but He did so as the King-Messiah Himself. <br><br>
        
        He called people to repent and also called them to submit to and follow Him as the Son of God. <br><br>
        
        Both John and Jesus emphasized that people cannot participate in God's kingdom without first repenting of their sins and changing the course of their lives to follow the way of Christ. <br><br>
        
        Our aim in studying the Word of God is for us to enter and participate in the Kingdom of God. <br><br>
        
        But how can we participate if we are not yet part of the Kingdom? <br><br>
        
        Jesus the King-Messiah said, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." <br><br>

        The King is already reigning. <br><br>
        
        The foundation of God's spiritual Kingdom on earth began on the day Jesus was crucified. <br><br>
        
        
        Your role is to accept His rulership and acknowledge Him as your King over your life. <br><br>

        Before God establishes His political kingdom on earth, He will first reign in the hearts of all His chosen citizens. <br><br>

        How can God reign in the hearts of His chosen citizens?<br><br>

        Jesus said, "REPENT."

        </p> <br><br>

        <p><b>How to expereince Genuine REPENTANCE?</b> <br><br>

            True repentance of sins is more than merely feeling sorry for one's wrongdoings. It involves a profound transformation of heart and mind. <br><br>

        Here are the key elements that define the essence of genuine repentace. <br><br>
        
       <b> Acknowledgment of Sin:</b> Recognizing and admitting one's sins and understanding their gravity and impact on one's relationship with God and others. <br><br>
        
        <b> Godly Sorrow: </b> Experiencing genuine remorse and sorrow for having sinned, not just because of the consequences, but because it grieves God. <br><br>
        
        <b> Confession: </b> Openly confessing sins to God, and when appropriate, to those who have been wronged, seeking their forgiveness. <br><br>
        
        <b> Turning Away from Sin:</b> Making a decisive commitment to turn away from sinful behaviors and patterns, rejecting them entirely. <br><br>
        
        <b> Seeking Forgiveness: </b> Asking God for forgiveness, relying on His grace and mercy, and believing in His promise to forgive through Jesus Christ. <br><br>
        
        <b> Restitution: </b> When possible, making amends for the harm caused by one's sins, whether through actions, words, or other means of reconciliation. <br><br>
        
        <b> Transformation and Renewal: </b> Allowing the Holy Spirit to transform and renew one's heart and mind, leading to a new way of living that aligns with God's will and purposes. <br><br>
        
        <b> Bearing Fruit: </b> Demonstrating the change through a life that bears the fruit of repentance—good works, obedience to God's commandments, and a growing likeness to Christ. <br><br>
        
        True repentance is an ongoing process, not a one-time event. It involves continually turning away from sin and turning towards God, fostering a deeper relationship with Him and living a life that reflects His love and righteousness.</p>

          <p><i>If you have a headset then better use one and feel God's presence while you pray. </i></p>
