                <h2>Deuteronomy 6:4-9</h2>

                <p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><b><sup>4</sup> “Listen, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord alone.</b> <br><br>

                    <b><i>Listen, O Israel...</i> </b> <br> 
                    There is a command to hear.  We must conclude that something is about to be said that is worth listening to. Something important is about to be communicated, so we would be wise to give our attention. <br><br>

                    In the Old Testament, God selected Israel as His chosen nation. However, today, through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, this love has been extended to all people. This message is also directed at us right now. Listen. <br><br>

                    <b><i>The Lord is our God, the Lord alone...</i></b> <br>
                    We need to remember who is commanding us to listen. In this verse, Moses is giving these commands. He is speaking on God's behalf, urging us to pay close attention to his words. God not only communicates with us but also actively encourages us to listen to Him. <br><br>

                    These same words are being given to us right now: <br><br>

                    <b>Are you listening?</b> <br><br>

                    The reality is that we are constantly bombarded with messages. People and gadgets are always competing for our attention, and we are significantly influenced by these forces around us. <br><br>

                    The Creator knows this, so He steps in and demands that we listen. As we will see, this God wants our full attention. He requires it from His people. </p> <br> <br>

                <p><b><sup>5</sup> And you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength.</b> <br> <br>

                    Our life's purpose is to obey God. By following this one command, everything else will naturally fall into place. So, how should we obey God? <br><br>

                    <b>...with all your heart...</b> <br>
                    First, we must love God with all our heart. In Hebrew, this refers not only to feelings and emotions as we think of the heart today but also to the mind alongside its thoughts, desires, and will. <br><br>

                    Loving God isn't just about what we say or how we feel emotionally. It shouldn't only be apparent on the day of worship, which is often when we express our love for the Lord and demonstrate our obedience. Our God isn't limited to being present only during worship; He doesn't disappear as soon as we leave and complete our worship duties. <br><br>

                    Many people believe that God can only be found inside the church, so when they leave after their religious obligations, they also leave behind the God they worship. Therefore, after mass, they return to being in charge of themselves, making all their daily decisions according to their own will, and forgetting the will and instructions of the God they worshipped inside the church. <br><br>

                    Let us not imitate people with such beliefs; instead, we should listen to God, to His voice. We hear His voice through His written Word. <br><br>

                    
                    Loving God with all our heart means loving Him with all our inner being, which includes our <u>mind</u> with its <u>thoughts</u>, <u>desires</u>, and <u>will</u>. <br><br>

                    <b>MIND</b>: <br>
                    God should guide our minds not just during worship but at all times. If our thoughts stray from God's will, we should replace them with thoughts that align with His teachings. <br><br>

                    <b>DESIRES</b>: <br>

                    God should also encompass our desires. How can we describe our desires? Our needs and wants are different. Needs are our basic necessities for survival, like water, food, and other essentials for daily life. Wants, on the other hand, are driven by our desires, such as owning a car, a nice phone, better houses than what others have, gadgets and things that we believe will elevate our status compared to others. <br><br>

                    People's understanding of wants is the endless desire for material things. Wants are never-ending. For example, you might initially want a bike, but after some time, you desire a motorbike. When you have more money, you no longer want the motorbike; you want a car. As your income increases, you desire a more luxurious car, then a helicopter if you can afford it, and eventually a plane. The human desire for material things is never satisfied and has no limits. <br><br>

                    Just as the god of this world deceives people's minds, it traps us in an endless mire. We need to change our perception about our wants. This is an instruction for us now, for those who wish to draw near to God. Let's make God's presence in our lives our primary desire. Since God is eternal and infinite, only He can satisfy our endless wants. He will fulfill the desires of our hearts. In truth, it is God that our hearts have been desiring for. We've been deceived by this world and its false god, leading us down the wrong path. We thought we were on the right track, but in reality, we were moving away from the path towards God that we must all follow. <br><br>

                    <b>WILL</b>: <br>
                    God should also govern our will. What does this mean? If we have desires that are contrary to God's will, we should submit to His will instead. When God governs our will, we can truly say, "Not my will, but Thy will be done, Lord." God knows what is best for us. Therefore, we should listen to His voice. God changes our perspectives because He knows what is beneficial and what could be harmful for us. </p> <br>

                <p><b>...all your soul....</b> <br>
                    Second, We must love God with all our soul. The Hebrew understanding of the soul is different from today's common view. We often think of the soul as our consciousness. However, the Hebrews saw the soul as both the life force within a person and including the physical body. <br><br>

                    This means we must love God with our entire being—not just our inner consciousness, but also with our whole body. If you truly love God and want to follow Him, you will avoid using your body for harmful vices. Examples of these include smoking, drinking alcohol, and using drugs. God knows these things are harmful to our bodies, which is why He needs to govern them as well. <br><br>

                    If you are free from vices meaning you do not have any vices stated above and you profess to follow God, also take into consideration the other wrongful actions of your body. Gossiping, for example, is frowned upon by God because it involves using our mouths to speak ill of others, who are also His creations and are also encouraged to draw near to Him. Laziness is another example, which goes against God's will as mentioned in the Bible, where it says, "Do not feed the lazy." Playing mobile games or being addicted to social media sites because they just waste the time that should have been spent on reading the Word of God. Additionally, all other attitudes mentioned in scripture that are not in line with God's will should be considered. <br><br>

                    God prohibits everything that brings harm to us or not beneficial to us, as this is also for our own good. The question is, are we capable of listening to and obeying Him? <br><br>
                    
                    That's why it's commanded not only to listen but also to put into action all His instructions. It's easy to follow God if you're willing to offer everything to Him. <br><br>
                    
                    He won't take those things because He needs them, but He will remove them because you don't need them. <br><br>
                    
                    Why? <br><br>
                     Because it will only bring harm to you or it is not beneficial to your spiritual growth. </p> <br> <br>


                <p><b>....all your strength....</b> <br>
                    Third, It simply means that loving involves our entire being. <br><br>
                
                    Does this mean you are still willing to offer your whole self to Him? Are you willing to let God lead your life? <br><br>

                    <b>The question is: </b> <br>

                    Are you still willing to follow and listen to His Word? <br><br>

                    If your answer is yes, here is His advice according to His Word.  <br><br>
                    
                    <b><sup>6</sup> And you must commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these commands that I am giving you today. <br>
                    <sup>7</sup> Repeat them again and again to your children. Talk about them when you are at home and when you are on the road, when you are going to bed and when you are getting up. <br>
                    <sup>8</sup> Tie them to your hands and wear them on your forehead as reminders. <br>
                    <sup>9</sup> Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.</b>
