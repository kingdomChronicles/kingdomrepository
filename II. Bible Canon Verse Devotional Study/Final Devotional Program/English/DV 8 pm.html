          <h2>Matthew 22:1-14</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          <p>   
            <sup>1</sup> Jesus also told them other parables. He said, 
            <sup>2</sup> “The Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of a king who prepared a great wedding feast for his son. 
            <sup>3</sup> When the banquet was ready, he sent his servants to notify those who were invited. But they all refused to come! 
            <sup>4</sup>  “So he sent other servants to tell them, ‘The feast has been prepared. The bulls and fattened cattle have been killed, and everything is ready. Come to the banquet!’ 
            <sup>5</sup> But the guests he had invited ignored them and went their own way, one to his farm, another to his business. 
            <sup>6</sup> Others seized his messengers and insulted them and killed them. 
            <sup>7</sup>  “The king was furious, and he sent out his army to destroy the murderers and burn their town. 
            <sup>8</sup> And he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, and the guests I invited aren’t worthy of the honor. 
            <sup>9</sup> Now go out to the street corners and invite everyone you see.’ 
            <sup>10</sup> So the servants brought in everyone they could find, good and bad alike, and the banquet hall was filled with guests. 
            <sup>11</sup>  “But when the king came in to meet the guests, he noticed a man who wasn’t wearing the proper clothes for a wedding. 
            <sup>12</sup> ‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how is it that you are here without wedding clothes?’ But the man had no reply. 
            <sup>13</sup> Then the king said to his aides, ‘Bind his hands and feet and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ 
            <sup>14</sup>  “For many are called, but few are chosen.”

          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>



          <p><b><sup>1</sup> Jesus also told them other parables. He said, 
            <sup>2</sup> “The Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of a king who prepared a great wedding feast for his son.</b> <br><br>
        
            Jesus begins, as He often does in Matthew, by making a comparison to the kingdom of heaven. Parables are used to illustrate a central point through analogy. <br><br>

            This time, Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven by portraying a king who held a grand wedding feast for his son. A royal wedding would be a significant celebration in any era. It raises the question of who will be invited to the feast and who will be left out. People from lower social classes would never expect an invitation, while the most prominent individuals would anticipate being included. However, this parable explores what happens when those invited do not wish to attend.</p> <br>




            <p><b> <sup>3</sup> When the banquet was ready, he sent his servants to notify those who were invited. But they all refused to come! </b> <br><br>
            
            Jesus tells a parable about a king who threw a wedding feast for his son, which would be a big event in any culture or kingdom. Invitations were sent out early to let people know they were invited. When the event was ready, servants were sent to tell the guests that it was time to come. <br><br>

            But in this story, the invited guests refused to come. They didn't want to go to the feast. <br><br>
            
            To Jesus' listeners, it would have been shocking that anyone would refuse the king's hospitality and the chance to attend a royal feast. <br><br>
            
            In this parable, God is the Father who is hosting the feast. The kingdom of heaven is often described as a great feast. <br><br>
            
            Jesus is the Son of the King and the Bridegroom for whom the feast is being held. <br><br>
            
            In our time, we can compare this message to today. The call to the Kingdom is being announced, but those who first hear it, especially those inside the church who do not respond to the call of God's Kingdom, are like the first guests invited to the wedding feast.</p> <br>



            <p><b><sup>4</sup>  “So he sent other servants to tell them, ‘The feast has been prepared. The bulls and fattened cattle have been killed, and everything is ready. Come to the banquet!’ </b> <br><br>
            
            Jesus' parable takes an unexpected turn. The central event is special, though not uncommon: a king throws a grand wedding feast for his son. Typically, this raises the question of who will be invited. Shockingly, in this case, the invited guests refused to come. <br><br>

            So, the king sends out another group of servants with a better description of what the feast will offer. The dinner is ready! The king has prepared his own royal oxen and fattened calves to serve to his guests. In other words, the king has gone to great lengths to ensure this will be a meal for the ages, a grand party, an extraordinary event. This is special. <br><br>
            
            Despite offering compelling reasons to attend the great banquet, the king also instructs the servants to deliver the invitation as a command: "Come to the wedding feast." There are benefits and blessings involved, but ignoring the invitation means defying the king's clear will. Yet, the invited guests still refused to come. <br><br>
            </p> <br>

            <p><b><sup>5</sup> But the guests he had invited ignored them and went their own way, one to his farm, another to his business.</b> <br><br>
            
            The main topic is how Israel, especially her religious leaders, have ignored God's call and command. In this story, a king sent out two groups of servants asking people to come to his son's wedding. The second group told them how great the meal would be and delivered the invitation as an order. <br><br>

            Clearly, the king represents God, and the wedding feast represents the kingdom of heaven. Some listeners may not have realized yet that Jesus was showing Himself as the king's son, making Him the Son of God. But who were these guests that refused to come even when the king directly commanded them? <br><br>
            
            Jesus shows that some guests refused directly while others just ignored the king's message. They didn't pay attention to the servants and kept doing their daily activities. It seems they were not interested in the feast and were busy with other things. This is like how some people ignore God simply because they are not interested.</p> <br><br>


            <p><b><sup>6</sup> Others seized his messengers and insulted them and killed them. </b> <br><br>
            
            In Jesus' parable, the chosen citizens of a kingdom are refusing their king's command to come to a wedding feast for his son. Some have ignored the servants who delivered the message, continuing with their daily lives. Now Jesus shows others defiantly refusing the invitation. This group mistreats the messengers and then kills them. They have gone beyond simply refusing to honor the king; they have started a rebellion by murdering his servants. <br><br>

            This makes Jesus' parable clearer; Jesus shows the prophets sent to Israel with God's message as these servants of the king. Like the servants, those prophets were often mistreated and killed by the leaders and people of Israel. The issue being rejected here is the son of the king. God invited Israel's religious leaders to welcome His Son, Jesus, as the Messiah. Not only did they reject that invitation by rejecting Jesus, but they would soon kill God's Son as well.</p> <br><br>



            <p><b><sup>7</sup>  “The king was furious, and he sent out his army to destroy the murderers and burn their town.</b> <br><br>
            
            Jesus' current parable started out pleasantly. A king spared no expense, inviting those he had specially chosen to attend a grand banquet for his son. When the time came, the king sent out messengers to inform the people that the feast was ready. That's when the story took a dark turn. Not only did the people refuse to attend, but some also ignored the king's second round of messengers. Worse, another group abused and killed them. <br><br>

            Now the king is understandably furious with his subjects. He sends out his army to destroy the people who killed his messengers and burns their city. The king will not tolerate an uprising against him. <br><br>
            
            For those who grasped the meaning behind Jesus' parable, he was issuing a stern warning. Israel's religious leaders were represented by those who murdered the king's servants. Throughout Israel's history, they had both ignored and killed God's prophets or stood by while others did so. This same fate had befallen the last prophet, John the Baptist. <br><br>
            
            God would not tolerate that rebellion forever. Judgment was coming for the refusal of the religious leaders to recognize and honor God's Son. Many commentators believe the destruction of Jerusalem and the burning of the temple by the Romans in A.D. 70 to be at least a partial fulfillment of this warning. Prior to Christ's earthly ministry, God had used other nations to judge Israel's rebellion. <br><br>
            
            If we are also in rebellion against God's will and constantly rejecting His call, be warned—God's judgment might come upon you suddenly, either during your lifetime or in the final judgment for all who refuse His Son's call to repent and return to God. <br><br>
            
            And yet, this is not the end of the parable. The feast is still ready, so the king decides to find other guests to invite since the first guests have refused.</p> <br><br>


            <p><b><sup>8</sup> And he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, and the guests I invited aren’t worthy of the honor.</b> <br><br>
            
            In Jesus' parable, the time has come to celebrate the wedding of the king's son. The oxen and calves have been slaughtered, and the feast is prepared. However, the king has no guests. The original invitees refused to come, even going so far as to murder the king's messengers. The king now describes those originally invited guests as "unworthy," paralleling how Israel's leaders rejected God's prophets and were subjected to judgment. <br><br>

            Religious Jews of that era understood the concept of God drawing clear distinctions around who could be in His presence. Under Old Testament law, this even extended to excluding certain individuals from aspects of worship, including those who disobeyed God's law and those with various health issues. Some in the Jewish ruling class prided themselves on their spiritual worthiness before God and their ability to keep the law and extra rules better than others. <br><br>
            
            Especially in the context of the prior parables, it becomes clear that Jesus intended to represent Israel's religious leaders with the guests who refused to come to the king's feast. Those listening must have been shocked by this claim. The king calls those very people "unworthy," revoking their favored status due to their refusal to honor the king's son. <br><br>
            
            We shouldn't say to ourselves today that this message was only for the Israelites who crucified Jesus back then. <br><br>
            
            We are also being warned. Those of us in the church, including leaders who refuse the call of God's Kingdom, will face the same fate as those who refused the Lord's call in the past. <br><br>
            
            If those who were first called continue to be stubborn, there will come a time when the Lord will pass over them and focus His call on others.</p> <br><br>


            <p><b><sup>9</sup> Now go out to the street corners and invite everyone you see.’</b> <br><br>
            
            
            In Jesus' parable, the king still wants guests at the wedding feast to honor his son. His first chosen guests have refused to come. Some lacked interest, and others acted out in rebellion against him. The king has called those guests, who represent Israel's religious leaders, "unworthy" to attend the feast. <br><br>

            Now the king instructs his servants to take his invitation to common people they find on the "main roads." Some translations use "street corners" and others use "highways". This phrase includes places where people are most likely to be gathered, as well as the roads leading out of town into the countryside. <br><br>
            
            There, the frustrated master commands his servants to extend invitations to those in all places in the city, especially those where the destitute would gather. <br><br>
          
            God is also calling us today to share the good news of His Kingdom with everyone we meet if those who were first called within the Church or congregation refuse.</p> <br><br>


            <p><b><sup>10</sup> So the servants brought in everyone they could find, good and bad alike, and the banquet hall was filled with guests.</b> <br><br>
            
            
            In this parable, the king's chosen citizens have refused to come to a wedding feast in honor of his son. After enacting harsh, but deserved, judgment, the king has called the original invitees unworthy and sent his servants out of the city into highways and intersections to invite all who would willingly come to the banquet. The servants succeed in finding guests, filling the wedding hall with people of all kinds, both "bad and good." The servants succeeded, means that the total number of Gentiles invited to be saved has been completed. <br><br>

            The king represents God, and Jesus is His Son. They are doing well. The king's servants may symbolize prophets, evangelists, and now all who will proclaim and share God's message in these Last Days. <br><br>
            
            The unworthy guests are the religious leaders who have refused to honor God's Son, Jesus, as the Messiah. Today, they are also the church leaders who refuse the message of the Kingdom of God. <br><br>
            
            The comment about "bad and good" as the replacement guests raises an interesting question. If the wedding banquet is the kingdom of heaven, how can both "bad and good" be represented there? The "bad and good" are all the people who are not attending any church that proclaims the message of the Kingdom of God. Thus, the invitation is now open to all who will heed God's call.</p> <br><br>


            <p><b><sup>11</sup>  “But when the king came in to meet the guests, he noticed a man who wasn’t wearing the proper clothes for a wedding. <sup>12</sup> ‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how is it that you are here without wedding clothes?’ But the man had no reply.</b> <br><br>
            
            
            In Jesus' story about the king and the wedding feast, there are some surprising twists. First, the king tells his messengers to invite everyone they see on the streets to the feast because the original guests said no. The hall fills up with all sorts of people, both good and bad. <br><br>

            But then, the king notices a guest who didn't put on the special wedding clothes given by the king. When asked about it, the guest has no answer. <br><br>
            
            In the story, everyone, whether good or bad, is invited to the feast in honor of the king's son. The king gives special clothes to wear at the feast. This guest seems to have chosen not to wear them, which symbolizes rejecting the goodness of Jesus. <br><br>
            
            This story shows people who want to be part of God's Kingdom but don't follow the King's rules. We know that God's rules are in His words, and we should read, think about, and obey what is written in the scriptures.</p> <br><br>

            <p><b><sup>13</sup> Then the king said to his aides, ‘Bind his hands and feet and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ </b> <br><br>
            
            The concept of being cast into "outer darkness," accompanied by "weeping and gnashing of teeth," is a common expression used by Jesus to illustrate God's eternal judgment. <br><br>

            In the context of this parable, this fate befalls a man who tried to attend the wedding feast without wearing a wedding garment. This man symbolizes those who believe they can enter the kingdom of heaven without meeting God's standard. They are the ones who think they are saved but are unwilling to follow and live out God's will in their lives. <br><br>
            
            God sees everything, and no one can escape His sight. Only those who are worthy will enter the Kingdom of God.</p> <br><br>


            <p><b><sup>14</sup>  “For many are called, but few are chosen.” </b> <br><br>
            
            
            Truly, many are called, but only those who obey God's will are chosen. A day will come when God will close the doors of His kingdom, and all those left outside will be gathered by angels for judgment. It will be determined whether they will be among the last to be saved or among those found unworthy by God. <br><br>

            All those left outside will endure the strict rule of the Antichrist. If they survive under the Antichrist's rule, they will also experience God's 7 great tribulations. The punishment of God will be upon the Antichrist and all the people left outside the Kingdom of God. If, through all the suffering, they remain faithful to God and refuse to submit to the mark of the Antichrist, they may still find salvation. However, they may also become martyrs, as only martyrs will find salvation once the doors of the Kingdom of God are closed. If you fail to overcome all these trials, you will be cast into the fiery sea called hell along with Satan. <br><br>
        
            So, let's not be stubborn anymore; let's try to enter the Kingdom of God while the invitation is still open because inside the Kingdom of God, there is no more death, and it is no longer included in the judgment to come.</p>
