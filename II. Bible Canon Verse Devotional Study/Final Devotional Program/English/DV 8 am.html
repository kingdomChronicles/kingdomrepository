      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>Matthew 13:47-50</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
      <p> 
        <sup>47</sup>  “Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. 
        <sup>48</sup> When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. 
        <sup>49</sup> This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous 
        <sup>50</sup> and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
    </p>

      <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

     <p><b><sup>47</sup>  “Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. </b> <br><br>
    
    This passage outlines a common fishing technique using a net. A particularly prevalent method is <i>trawling</i>, which involves dragging a net through the water. Another method involves casting a large net flat onto the water's surface, where weights pull it down, trapping everything beneath it. Both techniques gather all sorts of fish and sea creatures, some of which are valuable to fishermen, while others are not. <br><br>

    This concept forms the core of the parable: the net gathers everything, but not everything collected is kept. Jesus will reveal the fate of the caught creatures in the following verses.

    </p> <br>

    <p><b><sup>48</sup> When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.</b> <br><br>

    In one of the final parables in this chapter, Jesus again compares the kingdom of heaven to something familiar to His listeners in and around Capernaum: fishing on the Sea of Galilee. Specifically, Jesus talks about fishing with a net, a practice that takes various forms. Sometimes, a net is stretched between two boats or between a boat and the shore, and then dragged along the bottom of the lake. In other cases, a circular net is thrown flat onto the water and pulled down by weights. Both methods result in capturing a variety of animals; not everything caught in the net is something the fishermen want or need. <br><br>

    The net's contents are sorted. Some are deemed good, meaning they are worth eating or selling. Others are bad, meaning they are unusable. The fishermen sort through all the different kinds of fish, discarding the bad ones and keeping the good ones in special containers. <br><br>

    Every Israelite likely observed this process, which would have enhanced the impact of the parable on those who understood its underlying message.  
    </p> <br>

    <p><b><sup>49</sup> This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous</b><br><br>
    
        Jesus explains the meaning behind His parable about fishermen sorting their catch of different kinds of fish. <br><br>

        The fishermen on the beach, who throw out the bad fish and keep the good ones, represent the work of the angels at the "end of the age." Jesus is describing the judgment that will happen when He returns to set up His Political kingdom on earth. This judgment will start with the angels sorting and separating the righteous from the evil on the earth. <br><br>
        
        As the rest of Matthew's gospel and the New Testament will show, those who are with Jesus, saved by faith in Him and His death for their sins on the cross, will be declared righteous. Those who have rejected Jesus will remain in their sin and be considered "evil." <br><br>
        
        In the next verse, Jesus says again that the angels will throw the "bad fish," or the evil ones, into hell. <br><br>
        
        This sorting is already happening in our world. You can see it in how people react to the message about the Kingdom of God. God has started in setting-up His Kingdom on earth spiritually, in the hearts of the righteous through His Word. <br><br>
        
        We have learned in our previous devotions, that how you treat the Word of God shows how much you care about the things of God. If you love the Word of God, it shows that you have a relationship with the King of the Kingdom. If you reject the Word of God, you are also rejecting the King of the Kingdom of God. <br><br>
        
        You cannot love the Lord without loving His Words. Remember, the Word was God.
        </p>

        <p><b><sup>50</sup> and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</b> <br><br>
        
        Those found rejected were the sorted evil on the day of judgment—anyone not saved and didnt make to enter into the Kingdom of God are consistently said by the New Testament to be cast into a place of terrible distress. This is often referred to as a fiery furnace, as in this verse. This place is often described as one of crying and teeth gnashing, traditional expressions of great misery. This is Jesus' usual picture of what we commonly call hell. <br><br>

        The point of the parables is that a separation will occur, and we should not be foolish about it; this separation is already happening. <br><br>
        
        That God is going to classify people into one of only two categories. However, the Gospels and the remaining New Testament explain the criteria clearly. The righteous do not become so on their own by their good choices . Instead, they are the ones who receive "the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ. <br><br>
        
        Again, faith in Jesus Christ does not mean just saying it with your lips. It is shown in your daily walk with God. It is seen in how you treat His Words and apply them to your daily lives. <br><br>
        
        Those who reject this path to righteousness through faith in Jesus are identified by the sorting angels as evil, children of the Devil  and are thrown into the furnace.
