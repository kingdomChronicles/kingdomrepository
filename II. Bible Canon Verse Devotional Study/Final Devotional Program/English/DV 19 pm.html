          <!-- <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p> -->
    
          <h2>Matthew 6:33</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">KJV (King James Version)</p>
          <p>
              <sup>33</sup> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
          </p>

          

          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

         <p>In most Bibles, these words are printed in red, indicating that Jesus spoke them. This also signifies their importance. We should carefully understand when our Lord Jesus speaks, as He offers us much wisdom. Many Christians have heard this verse, but do we truly know its meaning? What does "Seek first the kingdom of God" mean and how do we do it? How do Christians seek the kingdom of God? <br><br>

        This is one of the key verses in all of Jesus' teachings, commonly used in quotes, art, and Bible memorization. Like any other lesson from Christ, it must be understood in the context of the preceding verses. Too often, Jesus' words here are taken out of context and used to suggest that God will provide endless material blessings if His children seek His Kingdom first. And also because of this verse, some people approach God, only to fulfill all their desires in life, but often with wrong motives and mostly earthly or selfish desires. That is not, at all, the meaning of this verse. <br><br>
        
        To better understand Christ’s intended meaning, please read the following passage to understand our point:
        <span  style="color: red;">Matthew 6:25-32</span> in your Bible. <br><br>
        
        <b>First</b>, the context of "these things" refers to the basic needs of life, such as food and clothing. Jesus commanded His listeners not to live in constant worry about how they will obtain these, even if they don't know where the next meal is coming from. He wants them to trust the heavenly Father to provide what is needed for His children because He values them greatly. Instead of living in constant and fruitless worry, Jesus gives His followers a different outlet for their energy: seek the kingdom of God, trust His righteousness, and leave it to Him to take care of the basic needs of our lives. <br><br>
        
        <b>Second</b>, seeking the kingdom of God means we make a conscious decision to turn away from worry or anxiety and turn towards God. Jesus stated more than a simple command addressing worldly concerns. According to Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible, this passage centers on worldly concerns like worry or anxiety, temptations most of us face. Jesus often warned His disciples about worldly concerns, and we counter them by seeking God and His righteousness. The Almighty calls us to seek first the kingdom of God instead of worrying—temporal or superficial concerns. We are called to refuse worry and anxiety. Instead, we seek first the kingdom of God. <br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion:</b> <br><br>
        
        The call to "seek first" God's kingdom and righteousness is connected to the other teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount. Motives matter, and only by sincerely putting God first can we pursue His righteousness. Followers of Christ should prioritize living according to the principles He has been teaching—principles that align with the teachings of the Holy Scriptures. <br><br>
        
        Seeking the kingdom of God and His righteousness means living in ongoing repentance from sin and leading a sincere, heartfelt, devoted-to-God lifestyle as described by Jesus. In response, God will provide whatever we truly "need" to accomplish His will.<br><br>
        
        When we seek Him first, He will surely meet all our needs, especially for us to fulfill His specific calling for us in His kingdom. Just trust Him. <br><br>
    
        <b>How to Seek First His Kingdom and Righteousnes?</b><br><br>

        Pray, meditate on His Word, sing songs of worship, continually humble yourself and repent, and always give thanks to God. In short, let's continue with our daily devotion.</p>
