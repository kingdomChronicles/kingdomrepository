          <!-- <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p> -->
    
          <h2>Isaiah 53:6</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
                <p>
                  <sup>6</sup> All we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned, everyone, to his own way. And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
                </p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

              <p>This verse starts by addressing us, describing us as sheep that have gone astray, each turning to their own way. This illustrates the sinfulness within our hearts. Each of us, in different ways, has turned away from God's path to follow our own.
            </p><br><br>

            <p><b>All we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned, everyone, to his own way. 
            </b> <br><br>
        
            There are many inspirational books, seminar speakers, teachers, and even preachers today who tell us to believe in ourselves, to have confidence in ourselves, and to be proud of ourselves.<br><br>

            But that’s not what the Bible is saying here. The Bible describes us as foolish sheep, thinking we know what we’re doing, but actually clueless. Like sheep, we are prone to wander aimlessly, lacking defense mechanisms when in danger. Sheep are not the smartest animals; they wander off and are slow to flee from threats. Similarly, we are prone to turn away from God's path to follow our own.<br><br>
            
            Even after we have known the truth and light from God, there is still a possibility for us to stray from His path and follow our own.  This is the picture God gives us in His Word: all of us, not just some, are like sheep who have gone astray. The smartest, richest, and most intelligent among us are still like sheep prone to wander.<br><br>
            
            That's why we are encouraged to continually anchor our daily lives in the Word of God. Without His constant reminder in our daily living, we are likely to lose our way.
            </p><br><br>

            <p><b>And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.</b> <br><br>
            
                This verse is situated in the middle of a prophecy about Jesus, describing how He would come and be pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities. It explains how He would pay the price of sin that we deserve.<br><br>

                Let us continually study and appreciate the beauty of this verse, which reveals that God has chosen to pour out the judgment we deserve for our sins and rebellion against Him upon Jesus. The Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.<br><br>
                
                Let's learn how Jesus has paid the price for every instance we have turned aside from God’s way to follow our own. Let's understand how God, in His love and mercy, has chosen to pour the judgment we deserve upon Jesus in our place.
                </p><br><br>

                <p><b><i>The gift of salvation can never be received by those who continue to turn away from God instead of returning to Him. Even if Jesus were to be crucified a thousand times, it would be in vain if we fail to understand the essence of what sacrifice He has done for us all.</i></b></p>

                    <p><i>Listening to uplifting music can help prepare your heart and mind for prayer. It can also be a beautiful way to connect with God before you begin praying. </i> </p>

                    <p><i>If you have a headset then better use one and feel God's presence while you pray. </i></p>
