      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>Luke 14:34-35</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
      <p> 
          <sup>34</sup>  “Salt is good for seasoning. But if it loses its flavor, how do you make it salty again? 
          <sup>35</sup> Flavorless salt is good neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown away. Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand!”
      </p>

      <p>Salt is valuable because of its "saltiness": it may not be attractive, expensive, or useful in other ways. However, let's learn and explore the important role salt played in the old days.</p>

      <p><b>Salt Use in the Preservation of Food :</b> 
          One of the main reasons salt was so important in ancient times was its role in food preservation. Before refrigeration existed, keeping food from spoiling was a major challenge. Salt's ability to draw moisture out of food through osmosis made it effective at preventing the growth of bacteria, mold, and other microorganisms. This allowed meats, fish, and other perishable items to be stored for long periods, which was crucial for sustaining populations, especially during times of scarcity or long journeys.</p>

      <p><b>Salt's Economic Value and Trade :</b> 
          Salt was a highly valuable commodity in ancient economies, often called "white gold" because of its worth. The high demand for salt led to the creation of extensive trade routes. Regions with abundant natural salt resources, like the Sahara Desert's salt mines, became wealthy and powerful trading centers. Salt was traded for goods such as gold, spices, and textiles, helping early economies grow and connecting distant civilizations.</p>

      <p><b>Salt Use as Currency and Taxation :</b> 
          In some ancient societies, salt was so valuable that it was used as currency. The term "salary" comes from the Latin word "salarium," which refers to the payments made to Roman soldiers in salt. This practice highlighted salt's critical importance to daily life and the economy. Additionally, governments imposed taxes on salt, recognizing it as a reliable source of revenue. The salt tax, known as the "gabelle" in France, lasted for centuries and significantly contributed to social unrest leading up to the French Revolution.</p>

      <p><b>Salt in Cultural and Religious Significance :</b>
          Salt held great cultural and religious importance in ancient times. It was often viewed as a symbol of purity, preservation, and loyalty. In many religious rituals, salt was used as a purifying agent and a symbol of covenant. For example, in the Bible, salt is mentioned in different contexts, such as the "salt of the earth" metaphor in the New Testament and the "salt covenant" in the Old Testament. These references highlight the deep cultural and spiritual connections people had with salt.</p>

      <p><b>Salt in Military Strategy :</b> 
          Salt played a strategic role in ancient military campaigns. Armies needed reliable food supplies for long campaigns, and salt-preserved provisions were essential. Additionally, controlling salt supplies could be a powerful tool in warfare. During sieges, armies would often cut off the enemy's access to salt, causing food spoilage and weakening the enemy's ability to sustain their forces.</p>

      <p><b>Salt in Social and Political Impact :</b>
          The control and distribution of salt influenced social hierarchies and political power. Access to salt resources could determine a region's prosperity and the authority of its rulers. Salt monopolies often led to the rise of powerful states and empires. On the other hand, scarcity or excessive taxation of salt could cause social unrest and revolts, as seen with the French gabelle or the Salt March led by Mahatma Gandhi in colonial India, which was a key event in the struggle for Indian independence.</p>

      <p>Moreover, the importance of salt in ancient times extends far beyond its role as a seasoning. Its preservative qualities, economic value, cultural significance, and strategic importance made it a cornerstone of ancient civilizations. By examining the multifaceted role of salt, we gain a deeper appreciation for how a simple white salt has shape human history, economics, and culture. </p> <br>

      <p><b>Now let's learn how God set the uniqueness of each person: </b></p>

      <p>Every individual on this planet is a unique blend of characteristics, experiences, and potential. This uniqueness is not just a superficial difference in appearance or personality; it extends to the very core of our being, shaping how we perceive the world, interact with others, and contribute to society. Understanding and appreciating this uniqueness is crucial for fostering a more inclusive and empathetic world. </p>

      <p>Each person's uniqueness starts with their genetic makeup. Our DNA, which combines genetic material from our parents, creates a unique biological identity. Our experiences, the challenges we face, and the opportunities we seize all shape our development. The culture we are born into, the schools we attend, and the friends we make all leave an imprint on our character. These environmental factors ensure that even identical twins, who share the same genetics, grow into distinct individuals with their own perspectives and preferences.</p>

      <p>Our personal experiences and the choices we make further distinguish us from one another. The way we respond to life's highs and lows, the values we uphold, and the goals we pursue all add layers to our individuality. Two people may face the same event but come away with different lessons and reactions based on their prior experiences and inherent disposition.  </p>

      <p>Every individual possesses distinctive talents and passions that set them apart. These unique qualities are further refined by God over time.</p> <br>

      <p>Some are blessed with a distinct talent, <br>
          Some are blessed with exceptional intelligence, <br>
          Some are blessed with management skills, <br>
          Some are blessed with administrative abilities, <br>
          Some are blessed with the ability to make money (wealthy).</p>
      
      <p>Some are gifted as musicians and singers, yet they use their talent in non-religious settings rather than of God.  <br><br>

          Others are gifted as preachers, pastors, or founders of churches where people gathered by God come together.</p>

      <p>Whatever characteristic God has given you, that is your "salt" in your life.</p>

      <p>Are you utilizing your uniqueness to draw people closer to God? <br>
          Are you using your uniqueness to spread God's goodness to others? <br>
          Are you using your uniqueness to uplift God to others? <br>
        Your talent, are you the only one who knows about it? Don't you want to use it to glorify God? <br>
          Is your intelligence just for your own benefit, or do you want to use it to expand God's Kingdom? <br>
          Your management, administration, and marketing expertise, don't you want to use them for God? <br>
          The talent you have for producing wealth or finances, God gave that to you so you can support the needs of His Kingdom. <br>
          The special abilities or gifts that God has given you, will you just hide them and let no one know that you possess such unique qualities?</p>

      <p>If you're a preacher or pastor, is it enough for you to care for just a few people, your age count is greater than the number of people you're caring for? And it seems that instead of sheep, there are more goats among those you're caring for. <br><br>

        <p>Your business, your job, your job position, or being a student is the salt given to you by God to proclaim Him to other people. <br> <br>
        
          Today, many people see salt as just a seasoning, but in ancient times, it was maximized in various aspects of people's lives. <br><br>
          
          Likewise, let us allow ourselves to be used in the Kingdom of God and let God teach us how to maximize and use our uniqueness that He has given us for His Kingdom. <br><br>
          
          Did you know that the uniqueness you have, is the exact missing piece of God's kingdom that God is calling you to fill now?</p>

      <p>God will multiply your impact if you are willing to be used by Him in His Kingdom. Let God use your uniqueness for His glory. <br><br>
        The question is, are you willing? <br><br>

          If the distinctiveness of salt is lost, it becomes worthless. Similarly, if you are not impacting the world for God, then you are just wasting your uniqueness that God has designed you to impact His Kingdom. It means you are of no use or useless if you will not become an asset to God's Kingdom.</p>

          <p>If a simple salt has made such a significant impact on the world's history, how much more could you, if you use your uniqueness to impact your family, friends, church, workplace, organization, barangay community, municipality, province and country and the whole world for God's Kingdom?</p>
