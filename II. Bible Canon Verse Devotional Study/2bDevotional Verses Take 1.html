                <p>
                    <sup>16</sup> And someone came to Him and said, “Teacher, what [essentially] good thing shall I do to obtain eternal life [that is, eternal salvation in the Messiah's kingdom]?” <br> <br>
                    <sup>17</sup> Jesus answered, “Why are you asking Me about what is [essentially] good? There is only One who is [essentially] good; but if you wish to enter into eternal life, keep the commandments.”  <br> <br>
                    <sup>18</sup> He said to Jesus, “Which commandments?” And Jesus answered, “You shall not commit murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not give false testimony; <br> <br>
                    <sup>19</sup> Honor your father and mother; and love your neighbor as yourself” [that is, unselfishly seek the best or higher good for others]. <br> <br>
                    <sup>20</sup> The young man said to Him, “I have kept all these things [from my youth]; what do I still lack?”  <br> <br>
                    <sup>21</sup> Jesus answered him, “If you wish to be perfect [that is, have the spiritual maturity that accompanies godly character with no moral or ethical deficiencies], go and sell what you have and give [the money] to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me [becoming My disciple, believing and trusting in Me and walking the same path of life that I walk].” <br> <br>
                    <sup>22</sup> But when the young man heard this, he left grieving and distressed, for he owned much property and had many possessions [which he treasured more than his relationship with God].

                <p>      
                    <sup>13</sup> That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, 
                    <sup>14</sup> and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. 
                    <sup>15</sup> While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. 
                    <sup>16</sup> But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. 
                    <sup>17</sup> And he said to them, “What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?” And they stood still, looking sad. 
                    <sup>18</sup> Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” 
                    <sup>19</sup> And he said to them, “What things?” And they said to him, “Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, 
                    <sup>20</sup> and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 
                    <sup>21</sup> But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. 
                    <sup>22</sup> Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, 
                    <sup>23</sup> and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. 
                    <sup>24</sup> Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.” 
                    <sup>25</sup> And he said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!

                        <sup>22</sup>  He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. 
                        <sup>23</sup> And someone said to him, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?” And he said to them, 
                        <sup>24</sup> “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. 
                        <sup>25</sup> When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us,' then he will answer you, 'I do not know where you come from.' 
                        <sup>26</sup> Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.' 
                        <sup>27</sup> But he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!' 
                        <sup>28</sup> In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out. 
                        <sup>29</sup> And people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God. 
                        <sup>30</sup> And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”

                        <sup>19</sup> I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore, you shall choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants, 
                        <sup>20</sup> by loving the Lord your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding closely to Him; for He is your life [your good life, your abundant life, your fulfillment] and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the Lord promised (swore) to give to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
