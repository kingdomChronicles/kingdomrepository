                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
                <h2>Romans 7:14</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
                <p> 
                    <sup>14</sup> We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am a creature of the flesh [worldly, self-reliant-carnal and unspiritual], sold into slavery to sin [and serving under its control]. 
                </p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><i>A gladiator once remarked, "I fought valiantly in the arena and emerged victorious in every battle. However, the greatest battle I've faced is the one within myself, and in that battle, I often find myself defeated."</i></p>

                <p>Apostle Paul clearly explains why most people repeatedly lose the same battle: "We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am a creature of the flesh-worldly, self-reliant, carnal, and unspiritual-sold into slavery to sin and serving under its control."</p>

                <p>But I am carnal, sold into the slavery of sin. "Carnal" denotes a weakness toward sin due to our sin nature. The flesh resides within me, attacking relentlessly, and I am no match for it. On my own, and if left to my own means, I become its unwilling, resistant slave.</p>

                <p>This is a conflict we cannot avoid, as we remain sinful unless God's power is at work within us. This is a common experience, even for those who are virtuous and attempt to achieve the righteousness of the Law through their own efforts. Sin is not only about committing wrong actions but also about trying to do what is right through our own strength.</p> <br>

                <p>When Paul considered God's holy Law and attempted to obey it, he recognized his sinful nature and his lack of power to keep the Law on his own. He realized that even the most virtuous person cannot overcome the flesh (sin nature) by self-effort alone. He had to come to terms with the presence of indwelling sin and his need for divine assistance to suppress it.</p>

                <p>This is why it was mentioned in our earlier studies that even our good deeds are like filthy rags before the Lord. Good deeds we do are not considered as such if we are not within God's plan. We are invited to submit to His will and follow His words so that all our actions align with His will and acceptable in His sight. Absolutely, continuing to learn and understand God's Words can bring guidance and blessings to our lives. 
                </p>
