                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
                <h2>Isaiah 64:6</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">Amp (Amplified Bible)</p>
                <p><sup>6</sup> For we all have become like one who is [ceremonially] unclean [like a leper], And all our deeds of righteousness are like filthy rags; We all wither and decay like a leaf, And our wickedness [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing], like the wind, takes us away [carrying us far from God's favor, toward destruction].</p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>Just as Isaiah was inspired by God to warn the Israelites of his time, we are also reminded by God today that all our "righteousness" is like filthy rags. <br> <br>

                  Our sinful attitudes pollute even our good deeds, and the impurity of our motives taints all our prayers, sacrifices, offerings, and praises. We cannot praise God only during our worship fellowship; we cannot approach God in worship if our deeds and motives are full of impurities in our daily lives.</p> 

                <p>We are all unclean; we have all become unclean before God. Even if we believe we are worshiping God inside a church fellowship, it is hypocrisy before our Divine, Holy, and Mighty God. Feeling like we are worshiping Him while our hearts are full of filthiness is not true worship but rather mockery. Our outward appearance of worship is empty if our hearts are impure.</p>  
                
                <p>Even in the noblest deeds of the most virtuous person, there is some taint of evil. We all wither like a leaf. Our sins... have separated us; they have carried us away, far from God, into a realm where God's presence is not felt.</p>

                <p>We are all impure-this can also mean "impure individuals," as the term signifies equally. People often refer to impurity through leprosy, which was considered the most severe form of uncleanness among the Jews. We are afflicted with a moral leprosy. We resemble the leprous man who must tear his clothes and walk around shouting, "Unclean! Unclean!" so that those who hear him will steer clear. This signifies that the community is like someone ceremonially defiled, unable to enter the Tabernacle courts, or like someone suffering from a repugnant disease. </p>

                <p>Due to sin, we are not only abhorrent to God's justice but also offensive to His holiness. The prophets often use imagery from the customary practices and spiritual rituals of the nations. The concept of clean and unclean things is prominent among these practices. Through these images, they often depict moral shortcomings and religious transgressions.</p>

                <p>All our righteousness is likened to a menstrual garment. Our righteousness, or justifications, are as filthy rags-rags that cannot cover us, but instead would only defile us. Prophet Isaiah refers to all the external ceremonies and services that the Jews relied on for merit and justification. Similarly, today we might think we are serving God by doing ministerial work in the congregation, but our daily lives are not accepted in the eyes of our Holy God.</p>

                <p>Our God desires to see our hearts, not just our outward actions and activities. Sadly, we engage in many activities without considering God's thoughts. Like the Israelites, we neglect moral duties and are guilty of gross violations of God's holy law. Prophet Micah, who lived during the same time, also speaks in a similar manner. The prophet's declaration holds true if we consider it as encompassing the best works and actions that any human can perform. All our works are so greatly flawed that they cannot justify us before a holy and just God.</p>

                <p>Our iniquities, like the wind, have swept us away-like a wind that withers leaves and fruit, or that sweeps away everything in its path. They have taken us away, similar to how the Israelites were taken out of their land and from all privileges and blessings, scattered throughout the earth. This separation can also be seen as being taken away from God's favor into a state of condemnation and wrath. Like the Israelites, we all experience hardships in our lives because we are living outside of God's approved ways. Our iniquities provide approval for the enemy to attack our lives and destroy us.</p>

                <p>That is why we are urged to consistently search, study and meditate the Word of God, to be continually guided and warned that serving the Most High God is not as many of us were thinking. We must serve God with utmost excellence, not with mediocrity. Our service to Him should involve our entire being-our actions, thoughts, and everything within us, at all times. God should always come first in everything. Amen.</p>
