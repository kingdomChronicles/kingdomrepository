      <h2>Isaiah 53:7</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
      <p> 
          <sup>14</sup> He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth [to complain or defend Himself]; Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before her shearers, So He did not open His mouth. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

     <p>As we continue our devotional series on the 700-year prophecy about the coming Messiah from the book of Isaiah, we reflect on a profound verse that sheds light on Jesus' demeanor and purpose. <br><br>

      Today's devotional verse does not imply that Jesus was totally silent. Similar to a sheep, He was not necessarily without sound. Instead, He followed the path laid before Him without resistance, rebellion, or aggression. A sheep does not attempt to escape or attack the shearer; it simply allows itself to be sheared. This image of the Messiah as a sheep provides a powerful lesson for us.<br><br>
      
      In Isaiah 56:6, we are compared to sheep, emphasizing our need for guidance and a shepherd. Here in verse 7, Jesus is compared to a sheep, illustrating that He became what we are so that we can become what He is. This transformation is central to the Christian faith. John the Baptist also called Jesus the “Lamb of God,” further reinforcing His role as our Passover Lamb, meek and gentle.<br><br>
      
      Jesus embodied the qualities of a sheep in His obedience and submission to God's will. He was meek, gentle, and non-resistant, even to the point of death. Despite facing tremendous injustice and suffering, He remained passive and did not retaliate against those who sought to harm Him. This humility and self-control are vividly demonstrated in the trials leading up to His crucifixion.<br><br>
      
      Jesus underwent three trials before His execution. During the Jewish trials, false witnesses were brought against Him, but their testimonies did not align, as Jewish law required two to three agreeing witnesses for an accusation to stand. Finally, two people agreed on a misinterpretation of His words about destroying and rebuilding the temple, but even then, Jesus remained silent.<br><br>
      
      Would we be able to sit quietly while others lied about us? Even the Apostle Paul, when wrongfully tried, lashed out, saying, “God strike you, you white wall” (Acts 23:3). Yet, Jesus did not utter a single insulting or hasty word. When Pilate questioned Him, He responded minimally, astonishing Pilate with His patience and composure.<br><br>
      
      On the cross, people mocked Jesus, challenging Him to save Himself if He truly was the Son of God. Yet, He remained silent, like a sheep before its shearers. His restraint and submission highlight the strength in His meekness. He had the power to escape or destroy His oppressors but chose to follow the path of sacrifice, laying down His life for humanity.<br><br>
      
      Even in the Book of Revelation, where Jesus is glorified on the throne, He is often described as a lamb. This depiction underscores His enduring qualities of meekness and sacrifice. The lamb was not weak; Jesus willingly laid down His life, sacrificing honor, comfort, worldly pleasure, reputation, and ultimately, His life.<br><br>
      
     <b>Application</b><br>
      Are we following the example of Christ? Are we quick to defend ourselves or insult our accusers? Do we prioritize our reputation and the perception of others? God's direction for Jesus to endure trials had a purpose, and every trial in our lives serves a purpose as well. The timing and nature of our trials are orchestrated by Him. Let us strive to emulate Jesus' calmness, patience, and gentleness in the face of adversity, trusting in our heavenly Father’s wisdom and goodness.<br><br>
      
      In conclusion, the 700-year prophecy about the coming Messiah reveals the depth of Jesus' sacrifice and His exemplary qualities of meekness and submission. As we reflect on His journey, let us be inspired to follow His example, trusting in God's plan and embracing the trials we face with faith and humility.
