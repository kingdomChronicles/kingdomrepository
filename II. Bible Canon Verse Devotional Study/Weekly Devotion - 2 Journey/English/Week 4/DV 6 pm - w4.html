          <h2>1 Samuel 17:45-47</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
          <p>
            <sup>45</sup> David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. 
            <sup>46</sup> This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands, and I’ll strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. 
            <sup>47</sup> All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves; for the battle is the Lord’s, and he will give all of you into our hands.”

          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

          <p>You will not get the point of your devotion unless you read first the following verses: <b>1 Samuel 17:1-54</b>.
        </p> <br><br>

        <p>Aside from the Lord Jesus, more Scripture is dedicated to David than to any other individual. He is mentioned in 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 1 Chronicles, and 75 Psalms, totaling 1,139 times. <br><br>

        He is the first person named in the New Testament after Christ (first verse, Matt. 1:1), and he is the last person named in the New Testament except for Christ (last verse, Rev. 22:16).<br><br>
        
        Next to Joseph, David is the most Christ-like figure in the Bible. This is especially evident in the story of David and Goliath found in 1 Samuel 17:1-54. This 3,000-year-old tale is widely known, even among those unfamiliar with the Bible, though some mistakenly view it as a fable. Many preachers use an allegorical method to deliver this significant Bible story, leading to numerous interpretations. <br><br>
        
        Examples of allegorical points include: <br><br>
        
        "Are you in a battle? A conflict? A tough situation? Is something or someone threatening your peace and security? Does a Goliath of sorts loom before you? Do you feel small, insignificant, or powerless in comparison?" <br><br>
        
        Another example is, "You’re going to defeat that giant. Yes, the obstacle is big, but you have greatness within you." <br><br>
        
        However, God does not desire our allegory; He wants accuracy. He doesn’t want us to rely on our own clever thinking; He wants us to be informed by His Truth. Our goal should be to understand how people of that time would have perceived the story. <br><br>
        
        While many today seek miracles, what we truly need is the whole Truth. <br><br>
        
        Although nearly everyone knows the story, what exactly is the lesson it teaches us today?
        </p> <br><br>

        <p><b>What is the Message of David and Goliath story for us</b> <br><br>

        Let's first recall the scene in the valley of Elah. Goliath, a giant nearly ten feet tall, towered over every man in Israel, including Saul, who was himself head and shoulders taller than anyone else. Goliath wore a bronze helmet and armor made of metal plates sewn onto a leather jacket, which weighed about 125 pounds. He also had leg armor and carried a massive bronze spear with a 15-pound iron head. Goliath was not only enormous but also armed with terrifying weapons. For 40 days, he presented himself to the army of Israel each morning and evening, causing the Israelites to stand there and shake in fear.<br><br>

        The fact that this continued for 40 days highlights that King Saul refused to confront this blasphemer of God. Fear was a recurring theme in Saul's life.<br><br>

       <i> 1 Samuel 13:11-13 NIV <br>
        <sup>11</sup> “What have you done?” asked Samuel. Saul replied, “When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Mikmash, 
        <sup>12</sup> I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the Lord’s favor.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.” 
        <sup>13</sup> “You have done a foolish thing,” Samuel said. “You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. <br><br>

        1 Samuel 15:24 NIV<br>
        <sup>24</sup> Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned. I violated the Lord’s command and your instructions. I was afraid of the men and so I gave in to them. <br><br>

        1 Samuel 17:11 NIV<br>
        <sup>11</sup> On hearing the Philistine’s words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.<br><br>
    </i>


        But the true chosen people of God are not paralyzed by fear. As our Lord told His terrified disciples during a storm on the Sea of Galilee, faith and fear cannot coexist in the same heart. Where there is faith, fear is absent; and where there is fear, faith is absent.<br><br>

        So, while this seemed like an insurmountable obstacle, David did not see it as a significant challenge at all.<br><br>

        Notice another dramatic contrast. As Israel faced this crisis, Saul made a generous offer to the man who could defeat Goliath:<br><br>

       <i> "The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and exempt his family from taxes in Israel."</i><br><br>

        The man who defeated Goliath would marry one of the king's daughters, receive great riches, and have his father's house exempted from taxes. What is significant here is that such incentives motivated Saul, but as we will see, that was not what motivated David.<br><br>

        Apparently, David arrived on the final day of Goliath’s 40 days of challenges. By God’s sovereign providence, Jesse his father, chose just the right day to send David to the battlefield with food supplies for his three brothers and their commanding officer.<br><br>

        David’s immediate reaction to this situation reflects his heart, motivation, and disgust, and is key to the entire incident. These are his first recorded words in Scripture, which reflect his lifelong attitude: <i> "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"</i><br><br>

        Take note: David was too young to serve in the army, yet he acted as though anyone in the camp with faith in God could challenge and defeat Goliath!<br><br>

        Do you see? He was essentially saying, "Who is this guy? Why hasn’t someone silenced this blasphemer? Why has this been allowed to continue for 40 days?"<br><br>

        He was deeply disturbed that a Philistine, uncircumcised and outside of a covenant relationship with the Lord, would be allowed to so boldly defy the armies of the living God.<br><br>

        Goliath’s words were not just an insult to the Israelite army; they were a direct attack on the living God. And David was not going to stand for it. When his elder brother criticized him, David simply replied, "Is there not a cause?"<br><br>

        Are you involved in the needs of the Kingdom of God? You were called into the Kingdom of God, do you think it was for nothing? Shouldn't you follow David's example, who got involved and showed concern? Even though he had specific instructions from his father and faced criticism from his brothers, he didn't let that stop him. We should all be concerned about what God is concerned about. The Kingdom of God needs to grow on earth to serve as a light to all people, especially those still living in darkness.<br><br>

        Asked yourself, <i>Is there a cause for me to be part of expanding the Kingdom of God on earth?</i><br><br>

        This is further underscored by David’s later conversation with Saul, where he tried to convince the king to allow him to fight Goliath. After recounting how he had killed a lion and a bear, he said, <i> "this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God."</i> To David, Goliath had reduced himself to the level of a brutish beast, so fighting him was just like fighting another wild animal. The Lord had delivered David <i> "from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear," and He would deliver him "from the hand of this Philistine."</i> David's trust was in God alone, not in his own ability. As we will see, this was the Lord’s battle, and David was simply the tool.<br><br>

        And you, are you willing to let yourself be used for the Kingdom of God?<br><br>


        We should also note the armor fitting, when Saul put his armor on David. What a sight that was! David could barely stand, much less walk. But ponder for a moment: why are we given this detail? Because divine enablement is greater than human devices. His weapons were not carnal but <i>"mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds."</i><br><br>

        You might say to yourself, "I’m just a student, there’s nothing I can do," or "I’m too old, there’s nothing I can contribute." But God is not looking at your age or your situation. God is looking at your heart. Will you allow yourself to be used for the glory of God?<br><br>

        So David removed Saul’s armor and “took his staff in his hand, and he chose five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine”.<br><br>

        As Goliath approached, bellowing, boasting, and blaspheming God, and then berating David, the text implies not even the slightest hint of fear in David’s heart. After Goliath boasted that he would feed David’s corpse to the birds and beasts, David responded with absolute confidence. He had already entrusted the entire contest to God. Why? Because the battle belonged to the Lord, not to him.<br><br>

        <i>
        <sup>45</sup> David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. 
        <sup>46</sup> This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands, and I’ll strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. 
        <sup>47</sup> All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves; for the battle is the Lord’s, and he will give all of you into our hands.” </i><br><br>

        The battle that ensued was hardly a battle at all. A rock the size of a tennis ball left David’s sling with such force that it crushed the frontal bone of Goliath’s skull and “sunk into his forehead.” It was all over, just like that! We can imagine the sound of clanging brass and iron and the thunderous thud of Goliath’s massive body hitting the ground. As was typical in ancient warfare, David rushed to Goliath in an instant, <i> “took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head.” </i> That was true <i>“shock and awe”—“when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.” </i><br><br>

        As we allow ourselves to be used by God in His Kingdom, everyone who mocked you, everyone who tried to hold you back, and everyone who doubted you will one day be struck with awe. They will be amazed by what God will do in your life.
        </p><br><br>


        <p><b>What Can We Learn as the Purpose of the Battle?</b> <br><br>

        David was not fighting his “own giant” personal enemies; he was fighting God’s enemy.<br><br>

        Goliath was not standing in the way of David reaching his full potential, living an abundant life, achieving his personal goals, or any such nonsense.<br><br>

        Goliath was challenging the God of Israel. David said it himself in our text. <i> “Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?”</i><br><br>

        David wasn’t there for David or for personal purpose only. He was there for God. In fact, David wasn’t even supposed to be in the battle. He was just delivering supplies.<br><br>

        But because Goliath was defaming God’s honor, David stepped forward to defend it. Once again, as noted earlier, the battle was the Lord’s, not David’s.<br><br>

        David had unwavering faith that God would bless his years of preparation and give him the victory because he was fighting for God, not for his own benefit. Remember what he told Saul: he had killed a lion and a bear. Here was a very brave and strong young man who was equipped by years of preparation and then empowered by God.<br><br>

        We, too, have been called and lifted from the depths of despair. We have been raised from our failures and taught the truth to prepare us, for what? To participate in expanding His Kingdom here on earth.<br><br>

        So, like David, it is our responsibility to practice and be prepared.<br><br>

        Let’s stop thinking so much about ourselves and concentrate on God’s glory!<br><br>

        Let’s stop being self-centered, people-centered and start being God-centered.<br><br>

        Let’s stop looking for miracles when things get tough and instead master the only offensive weapon God has given us , the whole truth and power of the Word of God.<br><br>

       <i> "Remember, the more trials we have, the greater faith we obtain."</i><br><br>

        The most striking description of David was that he was a man after God’s own heart. What does that mean? David desired God’s will in all things. Unlike Saul, he paid scrupulous attention to God’s Word and never tried to alter it to suit himself or the situation.<br><br>

        In the Bible, we read that the Lord was “with” David. The Hebrew word here (‛im, 5973H) indicates “something done together or in common with,” including the concepts of “fellowship, companionship, and common experiences.”<br><br>

        David indeed had something in common with God and a companionship that was truly unique. Why? Because he believed God.<br><br>

        Was David perfect? Certainly not. His failures with Bathsheba and Uriah are notorious, but those make him even more of an example for us.<br><br>

        Like David, we will also fail in various ways, but true faith will endure and surely be fruitful.<br><br>

        Stop focusing on your personal problems and worries. Avoid Peter's mistake; he drowned because he shifted his focus to the waves and storms instead of the One who empowers His chosen people.<br><br>

        Stop praying with a "for me, for me, Lord" mindset. Instead, pray for something that will benefit God's Kingdom, and you will be the one God uses. God will raise you as His champion, and if He raises you as a champion, He will first take care of everything in your life that hinders you from being His champion.<br><br>


       <i>Don't just wait, act now like David. Lead the change and don't follow the example of King Saul and his army who, for 40 days, allowed God to be defied without standing up to fight for Him.</i>
