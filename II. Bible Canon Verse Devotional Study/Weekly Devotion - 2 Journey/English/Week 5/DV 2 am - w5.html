      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>Mark 8:36-37</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
      <p> 
        <sup>36</sup> For what does it benefit a man to gain the whole world [with all its pleasures], and forfeit his soul? 
        <sup>37</sup> For what will a man give in exchange for his soul and eternal life [in Godâ€™s kingdom]? 
      </p>


      <br><hr>
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

      <p>The term "world" (kosmos) refers to the system of evil led by Satan, including pursuits, pleasures, purposes, people, and places where God is not wanted. It encompasses all thoughts, opinions, speculations, hopes, impulses, and aspirations that oppose God in any form. Essentially, it refers to everything the world can offer. <br><br>

      Jesus uses an extreme example to make his point. He asks what good it would be if someone could "gain the whole world." Even if this person controlled all nations, had all influence, all people, all pleasures, all money, all land, and everything else the world offers, what profit would there be at the end of their life if he loses his own soul? meaning, in the end he neglected to give attention to the salvation of his soul. <br><br>
      
      Much of life is wasted chasing things we mistakenly believe are important. We trade our time for things that don't matter, our energy for gains we never realize, and our hopes for dreams that end up broken. <br><br>
      
      The inferred answer also reveals God's heart towards us. The entire creation will be destroyed, but our souls are immortal, whether for good or bad. All human achievements will burn, but our souls will remain. Our identities, whether as followers of Christ or as those who rejected God, will exist for eternity. <br><br>
      
      Mark's audience likely found comfort in knowing that their current circumstances were insignificant compared to the peace their souls would experience in God's presence. </p><br><br>

      <p><b>Conclusion:</b><br><br>
      
      Our lives, our souls, find their true worth only with God. He should be the center, goal, and purpose of our lives. So, we should strive to enter His Kingdom by valuing spiritual things more. Instead of pursuing the world, we should pursue God and we should pursue His will through our lives.<br><br>
    
    
      As we draw closer to the Lord, we are enlightened by the truth, realizing that we have long been deceived by Satan and this world.<br><br>

      If we, who once lived in darkness, were reached by God through someone He used to guide us to this program, it's time for us to return the favor. Now that you are illuminated by God's light, strive to be an instrument for those still in darkness, who are chasing temporary things that ultimately don't matter if they don't find God in their lives.<br><br>
      
      Pray to God to use you and give you the wisdom to spread His message to others. In your prayer, God will show you the people you need to approach, and you should include them in your prayer list, praying for them together with the entire community of God's Kingdom.<br><br>

      <b>Task:</b><br><br>
      
      Create your prayer list now and include the people God reveals to you in your dreams or visions. These individuals might suddenly come to mind or appear in your dreams. They are seeking God's presence and care, just like you. By adding them to your prayer list, you are reaching out to those who need His love and guidance. Everyone who has already been enlightened by God will join you in praying for these people, strengthening the support and spiritual connection within the community. Your prayers, along with those of others, can make a significant difference in their lives, bringing them closer to God and His grace.<br><br>
      
      For those people who are still living in darkness, the longer they remain away from the presence of God, the more they suffer from the deceptions of the Kingdom of Darkness. Without God's guidance and truth, they are more vulnerable to lies and temptations that lead them further astray. They may find themselves constantly seeking fulfillment in temporary and worldly things, only to feel empty and lost. The Kingdom of Darkness preys on this separation from God, filling their minds with doubt, fear, and confusion. The absence of God's light means they are deprived of the hope, peace, and purpose that come from a close relationship with Him. As they continue to drift away, the deceptions they face become more overwhelming, making it harder for them to see the truth and find their way back to God. Therefore, it is crucial to pray for these individuals and reach out to them, offering support and guidance to help them break free from the darkness and embrace the light of God's presence.<br><br>
      
            
      Be an instrument of God's will from now on.</p>
