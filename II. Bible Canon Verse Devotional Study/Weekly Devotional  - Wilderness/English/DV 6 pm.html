                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
                <h2>Romans 7:21-25</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">CSB (Christian Standard Bible)</p>
                <p> 
                   
                  <sup>21</sup> So I discover this law: When I want to do what is good, evil is present with me. 
                  <sup>22</sup> For in my inner self I delight in God's law, 
                  <sup>23</sup> but I see a different law in the parts of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me prisoner to the law of sin in the parts of my body. 
                  <sup>24</sup> What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 
                  <sup>25</sup> Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I myself am serving the law of God, but with my flesh, the law of sin.

              </p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>Close your eyes and remember a time you did something you knew was wrong.  It could be a big thing, it could be a small thing. Think about it for a moment. Now, answer this: Why did you do it, even though you knew it was wrong? <br><br>

                  The reality is, we all experience this. Sometimes, we act incorrectly because we genuinely don't realize our actions are wrong. However, more often than not, we are fully aware that our actions are wrong, yet we choose to do it anyway.</p> <br>

                <p><b><sup>21</sup> So I discover this law: When I want to do what is good, evil is present with me.</b> <br>

                  The Apostle Paul is explaining a universal truth about human behavior: Whenever we intend to do what is right, evil is always close at hand. <br><br>

                  Paul's choice of the word "evil" is quite noticeable. He isn't saying that his habit of sinning despite his good intentions is a bad habit or a personality disorder. Instead, he is describing sin as his inclination to do evil, which is the opposite of good. Paul wants to do what is right, but then he feels the sin within him overpowering him, causing him to choose evil instead.</p> <br>

                <p><b><sup>22</sup> For in my inner self I delight in God's law,</b> <br>
                
                  Paul sincerely expressed his delight in God's law, saying that he genuinely loves it and wants to follow it with all his heart. However, he later admits that despite his love for God's law, he feels trapped by the power of sin. <br><br>

                  Many of us today also desire to do good things that are pleasing to God. That's why we go to places of worship, thinking that we will also be worthy in God's eyes. We have the feeling that we also want to fulfill God's will. So, one of the ways we know to fulfill what is written in His words is to participate in the activities of our religion or sect.</p> <br>

                <p><b><sup>23</sup> but I see a different law in the parts of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me prisoner to the law of sin in the parts of my body.</b> <br>
                
                  In the previous verse, Paul expressed his joy in God's law in his inner self. He has discussed his genuine desire to do good and obey God. Now, he elaborates on this by stating that when he strives to do good, he discovers sin is lurking nearby. <br><br>
                
                  Human beings are demonstrated to be profoundly susceptible to sin when we rely solely on our own strength, apart from God's power. Merely having good intentions is insufficient to prevent us from doing wrong. Paul has illustrated that those who are without Christ are undeniably helpless to avoid sin.</p> <br>

                <p><b><sup>24</sup> What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?</b> <br>
                
                  After sharing his frustration about still sinning even though he wants to do good and obey the law of Moses, Paul now cries out in desperation: "I am a miserable person! Who will save me from this body that brings death?" <br><br>
                
                  The cry in this verse shows that Paul admits he can't do what's right, no matter how much he tries. He realizes he is a slave to his own sinfulness and can't escape on his own. He knows he needs someone to come in and save him from his "body of death." <br><br>
                
                  Paul has made it clear that sin resides in his body and always leads to death. The sin inside him will kill him unless he is rescued. <br><br>

                  I hope that we can also be like Apostle Paul, seeing ourselves in the same light, and how we can escape the prison of our sinful bodies. Unlike many who attend places of worship seemingly unaware of their sinful deeds, in Paul's words, death is the destiny of those who remain in sin. We should also cry out that we may be freed from this same state of sinfulness.</p> <br>

                  <p><b><sup>25</sup> Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I myself am serving the law of God, but with my flesh, the law of sin.</b> <br>
                  
                    Despite Paul's frustration and cry over his inability to cease sinning even when he desired to do good, he labeled himself as wretched and questioned who would rescue him from his body destined for death. <br><br>

                    In this verse, Paul provides the answer: "Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!" Paul comprehends that only God can rescue him from sin and death, and He does so through faith in Jesus Christ. Only through God's grace and one's faith in Jesus can a person be freed from slavery to sin. <br><br>

                    Are you truly committed to breaking free from the slavery of sin? God wants the same for you. Let's keep learning how we can receive the gift of salvation that God is offering to all of us. Let's continue to explore the ways of the Kingdom through our daily devotions and walk with God.</p>
