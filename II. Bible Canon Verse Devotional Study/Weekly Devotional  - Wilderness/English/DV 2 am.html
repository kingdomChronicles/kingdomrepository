                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
                <h2>Joshua 1:8</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
                <p><sup>8</sup>This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall <b>meditate</b> on it <b>day</b> and <b>night</b>, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.</p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>
                <p>Who wants to have a successful life? <br>
                  What is the basis of a prosperous life? <br>
                  If you have a lot of money, is that considered successful in life? <br>
                  If you are surrounded by many friends, are you successful in life? <br>
                  If you are famous, are you successful in life?</p> 
                <p>Why do many commit suicide or are still sad in life even though they have reached the pinnacle of success as stated in the previous paragraphs?</p>
                <p>All those things can only be considered an illusion if God is not present in your life. Everything will be left behind and will be forgotten by everyone when your death comes especially when years pass by. </p>
                <p>How to have a successful life? Seek God!!!</p>
                <p>Seek Him (God) not through Religion, but through His Words and have a relationship with Him.</p>
                <p>How to have a real relationship with God, pray to Him every day and obey His words. Constantly meditating on His Words is an illustration of having a relationship with God.</p>
                <p>In the intensity of evil in this world, God advises us to meditate on His Word day and night.</p>
                <p>When we wake up in the morning, God should come first before other things that we do throughout the day, and before we go to sleep, God should be the last one to be with us before we close our eyes.</p>
                <p><b>but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. </b><br>
                Meditate, that is, read and ponder carefully. Reading carefully is like reading or studying a contract, it must be understood carefully so that we can carefully follow everything according to all that is written in it.</p>
                <p><b>For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.</b> <br>
                  There are different levels of success for each person, so for each one who wants to be a servant of God, the comparison is not applicable, because each servant of God has a different calling. And only God knows if you have fulfilled His calling for you in this life.</p>
                <p>Having a true relationship with God is the first and greatest success in life. Everything will follow and this will bring us on the true meaning of success in life.  All achievements in this world will have real meaning if God is the center of all these so-called successes in life.</p>
