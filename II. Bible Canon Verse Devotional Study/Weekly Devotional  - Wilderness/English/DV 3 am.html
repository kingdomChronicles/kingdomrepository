                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
                <h2>Romans 3:23</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
                <p><sup>23</sup> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>The statement here is short and to the point: Everyone sins. There is no distinction. All have sinned, both Gentiles and Hebrews fall into sin, male and female, and even in any profession you have, from street sweeping to preaching the Word of God, you fall into sin. Everyone has sinned. No one does not sin. There is no escape from this label. Paul does not offer any category besides "sinner," and everyone falls into it. " The most moral of humans-relatively speaking-and the most perverse of humans are all in the same container: "We are all sinners."</p> 

                <p>Worse, even though we are aware of right and wrong, even the law given by God to Moses doesn't make us moral or sinless. The Greek word translated as "fall short" here is in the present tense. In reality, we keep on falling short, meaning we all keep on sinning. In other words, even knowing the consequences of our sinfulness is not enough to keep us from sinning.</p>     
                
                <p>What is worse is that most of the people we know are not just sinning but enjoying doing sinful actions against our maker. And even for the most polite person we know, if we can open his heart, it will only prove that he is also a sinner.</p>

                <p>Because none of us are sinless, all of us fall short of God's glory. That matters, because we cannot be saved from God's angry judgment against our sin except by being sinless. That is God's standard, and we all fall short of His "glory" because of our sins. God's glory, or the glory of Himself and His kingdom, is what He shares with those who are in His family, His children. Our sin, though, keeps us from sharing in His glory.</p>

                <p>That's why we are encouraged to meditate on His Word continually, for us to understand the way of God on how to be saved and become acceptable in God's eyes.</p>
