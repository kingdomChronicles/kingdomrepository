                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
                <h2>Jeremiah 17:9</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
                <p>
                  <sup>9</sup> â€œThe human heart is the most deceitful of all things, and desperately wicked. Who really knows how bad it is?
                </p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>Our issue with sin is profoundly serious. It is essential to recognize this reality daily in our lives before God.  At our core, we are sinners in rebellion against Him. It is crucial not to underestimate the gravity of our sin problem. We must recognize its severity and not treat it lightly.</p>

                <p><b>The heart is deceitful above all things:</b> Trusting the heart is another way of trusting in man. To this point, the Prophet Jeremiah has given some reason to be cautious about the inclinations and direction of the heart. He noted how the evil heart of the people of Judah had led them astray. <br><br>
                
                The prophet says "Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone followed the dictates of his evil heart." <br><br>
              And another he says " Each one follows the dictates of his own evil heart, so that no one listens to Me." <br><br>

              and to the prophets of the land he says <br> "They prophesy to you a false vision, divination, a worthless thing, and the deceit of their heart." 
              </p> 
              <p>Our hearts often deceive us, often suggesting that fulfilling its desires is the path to happiness. The notion of "following your heart" stmbles when the heart is deceitful above all else. Many young people get into trouble because they are too emotional, often times they follow what their hearts dictate. That's why Ecclesiastes advises: Remember your Creator in your youth, before unforeseen events occur and it's too late, and irreversible consequences have already taken place.</p>

              <p><b>And desperately wicked:</b> The heart is not only deceitful but also wicked, and desperately so. Many have been led to rebellion, disobedience, and great sorrow by simply following their hearts, without critically examining or evaluating their hearts according to God's truth. "Follow your heart" is a poor advice when the heart is desperately wicked. The sense of the Hebrew for desperately wicked seems to have sickness more than depravity of the mind. </p>

              <p>Because our hearts are deceitful, we cannot trust or follow them. They are inclined to sin and disobedience against God. The passage indicates that the heart is not only deceitful above all else but also incurable. Many people fail to follow through with their New Year's resolutions because the desired change goes against the natural inclination towards evil in the human heart.</p>

              <p>Since God tells us that our hearts are deceitful, we can be assured that it is true because God does not lie. Our hearts can deceive us, and we do not want to be ignorant of this fact. We should not follow our hearts because they will lead us toward our sinful nature. Even when we try to do good things, our sinful nature can lead us in the opposite direction. Often, the direction our hearts are leading us is the way of destruction.</p>

              <p>It is too dangerous to follow your heart because it will only lead you into sin. Our hearts may deceive us into believing that our sinful desires are what we truly need, when in fact, obedience to God is what is necessary. Instead of leading us toward Christ, our hearts often lead us astray from Him.</p>

              <p>Our hearts cannot be restored without the saving grace of Jesus in our lives. Through daily prayer, Bible reading, and applying biblical teachings, our hearts will be more inclined to focus on Christ. And we will be the happiest when we are walking in complete obedience with God and His Words.</p>
