          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
          <h2>Ecclesiastes 7:20</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">MTB (Majority Standard Bible)</p>
          <p><sup>20</sup> Surely there is no righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.</p>


          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

          <p>This verse in Ecclesiastes makes a serious observation about human nature - no one is free from sin. It acknowledges the universal truth that, despite our best efforts and intentions to do good things, every individual fails to achieve perfect righteousness.</p> 

          <p><b>"Surely there is not a righteous man on earth..."</b> <br>
              This statement makes a sweeping assessment of the moral state of humanity. It declares that, in the earthly realm, no person can claim absolute righteousness. It's an acknowledgment of the inherent fallen nature of humanity.</p>

          <p><b>"...who does good and doesn't sin."</b> <br>
              The second part of the verse emphasizes the certainty of human imperfection. Even in pursuing good deeds, no one is exempt from sin. It acknowledges the dual aspect of human conduct, which combines goodness with inherent flaws.</p>

          <p>This verse is in harmony with the wider biblical doctrine regarding the universal nature of sin. Several verses state that everyone has sinned and does not meet God's standards. Ecclesiastes reaffirms this principle within its distinct setting.</p>

          <p>Acknowledging the impossibility of achieving perfect righteousness invites humility. It encourages individuals to engage in self-reflection, recognizing their need for grace and redemption.</p> <br>

          <p><b>How can we apply this truth in our everyday lives?</b></p>

          <p><b>Humility in Our Walk: </b> Recognizing that even the most righteous person is not without sin cultivates humility in our lives. It promotes an understanding of our dependence on God's grace and mercy.</p>

          <p><b>Embracing God's Forgiveness: </b> This acknowledgment encourages us to accept God's forgiveness instead of leading to a feeling of hopelessness.  It guides us to depend on the redemptive actions of Christ for the forgiveness of our sins.</p>

          <p><b>Understanding and Compassion for Others: </b> Acknowledging our personal battles with sin should result in empathy for others. It discourages judgment and promotes a compassionate understanding of the common human experience of imperfection.</p> <br>

          <p><b>Conclusion:</b> <br><br>
              <b>A Realistic View of Human Nature:</b> Today's devotion offers a realistic view of human nature,  highlighting the pervasive nature of sin. It promotes humility, reliance on God's grace, and a compassionate understanding of our shared struggle with imperfection. <br><br>

              Given these human conditions, it is only logical to conclude that the topic of righteousness and salvation should not be self-proclaimed or boasted about by saying, "yes I am righteous" or "yes I am saved." Righteousness and salvation is better to ensure this claim rather than brag to proclaim. It is better to await God's declaration on your righteousness or your salvation than to boast with empty words. Actions should reflect one's faith, revealing the truth to others. Living in grace holds more significance than making unsubstantiated claims. Let actions reveal a sincere heart and foster spiritual growth. Walk in complete humility and dependence on God. Instead, strive to enter His kingdom. God will someday proclaim, "Welcome, child, you're home," and in His Kingdom, you will find everlasting peace, never to walk in darkness again.<br><br>
          
              This verse also serves as a reminder not to criticize others for their mistakes, acknowledging that they also struggle with human nature and sin. Rather than condemning them, we may be instruments in God's hands to help them deepen their relationship with Him. Encouraging them to engage in this Daily Devotional Program could enable them to experience God personally, resulting in a change in the behaviors others may criticize. <br><br>
          
              This recognition extends an invitation to all individuals to embrace the redeeming work of Christ and live in the freedom of His forgiveness.</p>
