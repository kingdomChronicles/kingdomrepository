      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>Luke 13:22-30</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
      <p> 
          <sup>22</sup>  He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. 
          <sup>23</sup> And someone said to him, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?” And he said to them, 
          <sup>24</sup> “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. 
          <sup>25</sup> When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us,' then he will answer you, 'I do not know where you come from.' 
          <sup>26</sup> Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.' 
          <sup>27</sup> But he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!' 
          <sup>28</sup> In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out. 
          <sup>29</sup> And people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God. 
          <sup>30</sup> And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”       
      </p>

      <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

      <p><b><sup>22</sup>  He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. </b> <br> <br>

        In this passage, the villages and towns represent different kinds of people our Lord is talking to and those who come to Him. Teaching and journeying towards Jerusalem means that God is personally guiding us on how to reach the city where people worship Him, give thanks, and make sacrifices for forgiveness.<br><br>

        God also teaches us how to approach Jerusalem, where we will praise Him sincerely and truthfully. We learn how to offer our own Thanksgiving offerings, which means God helps us understand everything He does in our lives, whether big or small. We are taught to be grateful at all times.
        <br><br>
          
        He also guides us in seeking forgiveness, which means we should regularly ask God to forgive our sins. In Israel, certain sins, like intentional ones, could not be forgiven through sacrifices and were punished under Moses' law. Only unintentional sins could be forgiven through sin offerings.
        <br><br>

        Today, it's not acceptable to claim to follow Christ while continuing to sin. We must understand that God does not tolerate His followers engaging in sins He hates. If we unintentionally sin, God's Spirit teaches us to be sensitive and quickly seek His forgiveness, preventing Satan from accusing us because of our sins.</p> <br> <br>

        <p><b><sup>23</sup> And someone said to him, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?”  </b> <br> <br>

          This is also a question for us. Among the few who will be saved, are we one of them?
        </p> <br> <br>

                        
          <p><b>And he said to them, 
              <sup>24</sup> “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. </b> <br> <br>

              The Lord teaches us to strive to enter through the narrow door. Many are called to salvation because salvation is offered to all, but only those who respond to God's call will enter His kingdom. The opportunity to enter His kingdom is only available while the narrow door remains open. <br><br>

              Why does God call us to pass through the narrow door? It's because He wants us to let go of unnecessary baggage on our journey with Him. If we continue to harden our hearts, we will not be able to fit through that narrow door. <br><br>
              
              Moreover, the narrow door symbolizes our readiness to be disciplined. It entails following God's plans and ways, not just our own means.<br><br>

              God knows everything, so our role is to obey His will. Whether He tells us to act or to relinquish something, we must comply because He knows what is best for us. <br><br>

              Another significance of the narrow door is allowing God to shape us into the individuals He intended us to be. God removes all excess so that we can freely walk in the path He has chosen for us.</p> <br> <br>


            <p><b><sup>25</sup> When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us,' then he will answer you, 'I do not know where you come from.' </b> <br> <br>

              There will come a day when God will close the narrow door, and He is already warning us through His word. Let's not allow our hearts to become hardened so that we do not find ourselves unable to enter His kingdom. For no amount of prayer in those days will be able to change our fate—it will already be too late.
            </p> <br> <br>

            <p><b><sup>26</sup> Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.' </b> <br> <br>

              We cannot justify everything we have done as good solely based on our own perspectives. Today's scripture instructs us in God's ways so that we will not have any excuse in the future if we choose not to follow them now.</p> <br><br>

            <p><b><sup>27</sup> But he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!' </b> <br> <br>

              Let's not continue to harden our hearts so that we don't reach the point where God Himself will tell us, "Depart from Me. I do not know you."
            </p> <br> <br>

            <p><b><sup>28</sup> In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out. </b> <br> <br>

              According to God's word, if you do not enter His kingdom, judgment awaits outside for everyone. It is written that inside, you will see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Even more concerning, you may see others from your devotional group who entered the kingdom. If you persist in stubbornness, you risk being left outside, awaiting Satan's judgment to be cast into the Lake of Fire along with all who rejected God. </p> <br> <br>

            <p><b><sup>29</sup> And people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God. </b> <br> <br>

              There is an exact number of those who will be saved; if you persist in stubbornness, you will be excluded from His kingdom.<br> <br>

              Romans 11:25 AMP <br>
              <sup>25</sup> I do not want you, believers, to be unaware of this mystery [God’s previously hidden plan]—so that you will not be wise in your own opinion—that a partial hardening has [temporarily] happened to Israel [to last] until the <u>full number</u> of the Gentiles has come in; 
            </p> <br> <br>

            <p><b><sup>30</sup> And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.” </b> <br> <br>

              And the most agonizing part is that even if you are among the first called, you might witness those who come after you entering His kingdom while you are left outside the Kingdom of God.<br> <br>

              Based on the scriptures and what we've learned: we should not be stubborn, but listen to all of God's teachings and corrections because His coming is close. We are in the last part of the "Last Days." The call to embrace salvation is urgent— right NOW..<br> <br>

              It is recommended not to be complacent about your salvation, but to work diligently and study God's words carefully because the goal of our devotion is for God to guide us in the path and correct understanding of salvation. Let us keep learning until our salvation is assured. </p> <br>
