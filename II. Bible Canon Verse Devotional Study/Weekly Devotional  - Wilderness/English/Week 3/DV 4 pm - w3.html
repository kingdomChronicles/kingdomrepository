          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
          <h2>2 Corinthians 11:15</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
          <p> 
              <sup>15</sup> It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve. 
          </p>

                          

          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

         <p>Paul is exposing false teachers who have been working among the Corinthians. These deceivers are trying to turn believers against Paul to gain their loyalty. Paul bluntly calls them false apostles and deceitful workers. It’s no surprise; even the devil, an angel of darkness, can disguise himself as an angel of light.<br><br>

        These false teachers also disguise themselves as ministers of righteousness. They may look genuine, but they are not true ministers of righteousness. They mimic Gospel preachers and pretend to uphold the doctrine of justification by Christ's righteousness, but they corrupt it and mix it with their own ideas. They present themselves as champions of holiness and good works, vehemently opposing the doctrines of grace. By doing so, they serve their master, Satan, who knows that emphasizing works can harm the Gospel and definitely will never save a single soul. Despite their outward appearance of zeal for good works, these men are actually ministers of Satan, promoting his kingdom of darkness.<br><br>
        
        Paul warned that their end will match their deeds. This statement should alert the Corinthians to stay away from these people. Paul often mentions God's judgment for those who practice evil, stating that their end will be according to their works. Even if they are not exposed in this world, they cannot deceive God. He will reveal their hypocrisy, expose their lies and evil deeds, and judge them, condemning them to eternal punishment. These false teachers, who disguise themselves as ministers of righteousness, will eventually be thrown into the eternal lake of fire when God exposes their deeds.<br><br>
        
        In conclusion, it is essential for us to remain steadfast in our commitment to the truth found in God's Word. By diligently studying and applying the Scriptures in our daily lives, we safeguard ourselves from deception and false teachings. Let us seek out the importance of regular engagement with God's Word, ensuring that our faith is rooted in the divine truth rather than the misleading doctrines of false teachers. Through this devotion, we can cultivate a deeper understanding and genuine worship of God, staying aligned with His will and purpose.</p>
