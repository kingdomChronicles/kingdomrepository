  <h2>Genesis 1:2</h2>
  <p class="chapterTitle">KJV (King James Version)</p>

  

  <p><sup>2</sup>"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."</p>

  <br><hr>
  <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>


  <p>Imagine a big, empty room that has nothing in it—not even a light. That's what the Earth was like at first. When the Bible talks about the Earth being "without form and void," it means there was no shape or order, and it was totally empty. <br><br>

  Then, it says "darkness was upon the face of the deep." This means it was really dark, like when you turn off all the lights and can't see anything. There was only water all around, like a giant ocean. <br><br>
  
  But here's the cool part! It mentions "the Spirit of God" moving on the waters. Think of it like having a really special friend who brings light and life. The Spirit of God was there, getting ready to make everything beautiful and full of life. <br><br>
  
  So, in simple terms, Genesis 1:2 tells us that before the world was made, everything was dark and empty, but God was there, ready to create amazing things!
     <br><br>
    
    
    <b><i>Points to Consider:</i></b> <br><br>

    1. <b>The Earth Was Empty:</b><br><br>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Without Form:</b> - This means that the Earth didn’t have any shape or structure. Imagine a big, flat pancake that hasn’t been cooked yet—it’s just there, without any hills or valleys.
      </li> <br>
      <li>
        <b>Void:</b> - This means there was nothing there! It’s like an empty box with no toys inside.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <p>2. <b>All Dark:</b></p><br><br>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Darkness:</b> - Picture being in a room with no lights on. You can’t see anything because it’s super dark. This is how the Earth was before everything was made—just darkness!
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <p>3. <b>A Vast Ocean:</b></p> <br><br>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Face of the Deep:</b> - When it says “deep,” it refers to the waters that covered the Earth. Imagine a giant ocean or a deep swimming pool that goes on forever. The Earth was like a big, dark ocean.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <p>4. <b>Special Presence of God:</b></p> <br><br>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>The Spirit of God:</b> - This phrase tells us that God’s Spirit was there. You can think of it like a warm light. Even though everything was dark, the Spirit of God was moving around, getting ready to create amazing things.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>5. <b>Getting Ready for Creation:</b></p> <br><br>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Moving on the Waters:</b> - The Spirit of God was not just sitting still. It was active and moving. This means something exciting was about to happen! God was preparing to start creating everything we see today: the sky, the land, the plants, animals, and people.
      </li>
    </ul><br>


    <p> 
    <b>Summary:</b> <br>
    So when we look at Genesis 1:2, we learn that in the beginning, the Earth was dark, empty, and like a big ocean. But God was there, and He was getting ready to make the world full of life, color, and wonder! It's a reminder that even in empty or dark times, something wonderful can happen. <br><br>

    <p>
      <i>If God was able to prepare and organize the darkness and chaos of the world in the beginning, how much easier would it be for Him to take care the future and growth of a child who obeys Him? </i></p>


    <b><i>Questions:</i></b> <br><br>

      1. What does it mean when the Earth was described as "without form and void"? Can you think of something that is empty?<br><br>


      2. Why do you think the Bible describes the Earth as being dark at the beginning? Can you imagine what it would be like to be in a completely dark room?<br><br>
      
      
      3. What do you think the "Spirit of God" was doing when it was moving on the waters? What do you think God was getting ready to create?
      
    </p>
