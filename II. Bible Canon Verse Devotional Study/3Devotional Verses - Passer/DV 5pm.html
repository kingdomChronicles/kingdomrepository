                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    

                <h2>Romans 6:12-13</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
                <p>
                  <sup>12</sup> Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. 
                  <sup>13</sup> Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness.
                </p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>This devotional verse reminds us that we are under the Power of Grace, not Law. Before we placed our faith in Jesus, we were slaves to sin, under its dominion. We have no power over sin in our lives. Yet God, in his mercy, opens our eyes to his grace through Jesus.</p> 

                <p>Dear brothers and sisters, do you remember that before we placed our faith in Jesus the Son of God, we were slaves to sin, and we were under his dominion? We have no power over sin in our lives, we are under its desire, and that's why we are first the enemy of God. Yet God, in His mercy, sacrificed His son to open our eyes in His grace, so that sinners can be reconciled to God, through sincere repentance and sincere turn around to our old self.</p>

                <p>Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Maybe our sinful actions are reduced, because we are continually attending our fellowship activities. Can we assess ourselves, whether the sinful desire is eliminated or just being reduced? God wants our whole being, not just a portion of it. The presence of evil in our being is a sign that we do not want to surrender our life totally to God but to retain some portion so that we can still do the things we want to do with ourselves, not through God. </p>

                <p>We have studied the importance of having fellowship with our God daily through His word in the past, days, days, and nights fellowship with our maker so that we can become successful, especially in defeating the desire of evil in ourselves. If, from the start, we have perfectly obeyed what we have learned in the past days of our daily devotion, then it's a big commendation from heaven, because there is one on earth who is learning the things of God, especially on becoming obedient to His words. God desires our obedience so that He can always guide us on our way and protect us from the schemes of the enemy in our lives and our family. But if you are one of the list who prayed to God and committed to obeying His word, what happened, why do you always fail to obey God's word? We are told to have our fellowship with Him day and night. Why miss this opportunity to be with our creator? Why do we focus on material things or worldly things which will fade away someday? We are hard-hearted to commune with our God. Do you love God? Or do you just want to love Him only with your lips, but your heart is far from it?</p>

                <p>Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, <br>
                  The word tells us not to offer ourselves as an instrument of wickedness. If you can not offer a portion of your daily life to God, a portion when you wake up in the morning, and a portion before you close your eyes before going to sleep. Then, it's just a sign that you did not turn away from yourself, because your time is your own time, and God is not being considered in your daily walk, and then you are telling yourself that you are a son of God. Do not be a hypocrite. Someday all hypocrites will be cast into hell. They are the ones whom God says, I do not know you, you are just worshiping Me with your lips and not with your heart. If you worship Him in your heart, then you must be sincere in following every word you are reading. You must be sincere in obeying what has been written in it. </p>

                  <p>Someday and this will happen soon, His Spirit will not be present to convict people. Do not wait for the door of the Kingdom to be shut closed to sinners who are hard-hearted to the call of God. God is serious in calling people to repentance because He knows the forthcoming doom of all who reject His calling. That is the reason why the Son of God sacrificed His life for all of us who seriously repent for us to be saved from this impending judgment of all sinners, including Satan.</p>

                  <p>It is instructed that we must offer every part of our life as an instrument of righteousness. How can we offer ourselves if just a portion of our time is not offered to God? Brother and sister, God is calling us to have a serious relationship with Him. Don't just ignore God in your life. It is not enough to go to a church to fellowship with God, because true fellowship happens when you are alone. True fellowship happens during your daily walk with God.</p>
