                <h2>Luke 13:22-30</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
                <p> 
                    <sup>22</sup>  He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. 
                    <sup>23</sup> And someone said to him, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?” And he said to them, 
                    <sup>24</sup> “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. 
                    <sup>25</sup> When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us,' then he will answer you, 'I do not know where you come from.' 
                    <sup>26</sup> Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.' 
                    <sup>27</sup> But he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!' 
                    <sup>28</sup> In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out. 
                    <sup>29</sup> And people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God. 
                    <sup>30</sup> And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”       
                </p>

                                

                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><b><sup>22</sup>  He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. </b> <br> <br>

                    In this verse, the villages and towns represent the different types of people that our Lord is talking to and the different types of people who approach Him. Teaching and journeying towards Jerusalem means that God is personally journeying with us to teach us how to reach Jerusalem too. Jerusalem is the place where the people worship God; there they offer their thanksgiving offerings and offerings for the forgiveness of their sins. <br><br>

                    God is also teaching us how to go to Jerusalem, where we will also praise Him in spirit and in truth. We are taught how to conduct our own Thanksgiving offerings, which means that God will give us the discernment to see everything that God is doing in our lives, whether big or small. We are taught to be thankful all the time. <br><br>
                    
                    To teach us on our own offering for the forgiveness of sins, which means that we are taught to learn to ask God for forgiveness of our sins regularly. There are sins in Israel for which no sacrifice can be offered, such as intentional sins, which are immediately punishable according to the law of Moses, and only unintentional sins can be forgiven by God through sin offerings. <br><br>

                    In our time, it is also not acceptable to be a follower of Christ, and still we live in a state of repeating sin. We must be sensitive. God does not allow His followers to participate in the sins that He hates. And if we sin against God unintentionally, the Spirit of God also teaches us to be sensitive, and we should immediately ask Him for forgiveness so that Satan can no longer use it to accuse us.
                  </p> <br> <br>

                  <p><b><sup>23</sup> And someone said to him, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?”  </b> <br> <br>

                    This is also a question for us. Among the few who will be saved, are we one of them?
                  </p> <br> <br>

                                  
                    <p><b>And he said to them, 
                        <sup>24</sup> “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. </b> <br> <br>

                        The Lord said that we should strive to enter the narrow door. Many will be called because salvation is a call for all. But only the ones who hid from God's call are the ones who will enter it. The entrance to His kingdom is only available while the narrow door is still open. <br><br>

                        Why is God calling us to pass through the narrow door? Because He wants us to leave our extra baggage that we don't really need on our journey with Him. If we continue to harden our hearts, we will definitely not fit through that narrow door. <br><br>
                        
                        One of the things that the narrow door also represents is our willingness to be disciplined; it is not our will or our own way that should be followed but the design and the ways of God alone. <br><br>

                        We have learned that God knows everything, so our part is to follow His will. If He says, Do this, do that, or leave that, then we must be obedient to follow His ways because He knows what's best for us. <br><br>

                        Another meaning of a narrow door is to allow God to squeeze us into the form that He needs to shape us. God will remove all the excess so that we can freely walk in the direction He designed us to walk.
                      </p> <br> <br>


                      <p><b><sup>25</sup> When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us,' then he will answer you, 'I do not know where you come from.' </b> <br> <br>

                        The day will come when God will finally shut the narrow door, and God is already reminding us today through His word. Let's not harden our hearts so that we won't be among those who can never make it into His kingdom. Because no matter how much we pray to God in those days, it's already too late.
                      </p> <br> <br>

                      <p><b><sup>26</sup> Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.' </b> <br> <br>

                        We cannot justify to God everything good we have done according to our own perception. But in today's scripture, God teaches us His ways so that we have no excuse someday if we do not follow them now.
                      </p> <br> <br>

                      <p><b><sup>27</sup> But he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!' </b> <br> <br>

                        Let's not continue to harden our hearts so that we don't reach the point where God himself will tell us, "Depart from Me. I do not know you."
                      </p> <br> <br>

                      <p><b><sup>28</sup> In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out. </b> <br> <br>

                        It is all written in God's word that if you do not enter His kingdom, judgment awaits you outside. And it says here that you will see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob inside. What is even worse is that you will also see those who studied in the same batch in your devotion, and they got inside the kingdom. And if you continue to be stubborn, you will be left outside while waiting for the judgment of Satan the devil to be cast on the Lake of Fire, together with all the people who rejected God.
                      </p> <br> <br>

                      <p><b><sup>29</sup> And people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God. </b> <br> <br>

                        There is an exact number of those who will be saved; if you continue to be stubborn, you will be left out of His kingdom.
                      </p> <br> <br>

                      <p><b><sup>30</sup> And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.” </b> <br> <br>

                        And the worst part of it is that even if you are the first to be called, you will see that those who are behind you will be the ones who enter His kingdom. <br><br>

                        It is clear from the scriptures and what we have studied: let us not be stubborn but listen to all the teachings and corrections of our God because His coming is near. We are living in the very last part of the "Last Days." The call to salvation is NOW. <br><br>

                        It is said that you should not be complacent about your salvation but work even harder and carefully study the words of God because God's purpose in our devotion is to teach us the way and correct understanding of salvation. Let us continue to learn until our salvation is complete.
                      </p> <br>
