                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
                <h2>1 Peter 5:7</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">Amp (Amplified Version)</p>
                <p>
                    <sup>7</sup> casting all your cares [all your anxieties, all your worries, and all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares about you [with deepest affection, and watches over you very carefully].
                </p>



                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>Peter's words were a command. It is not God's will for His children to continue to live under the burdens of this world. This truly encourages us to believe that we are indeed overwhelmed by the challenges and worries around us. God, through His Apostle Peter, commands us to put our anxieties, fears, and all our worries to Him. Sometimes we are so afraid of the aftereffects that if we surrender these things to Him, we are afraid of what other people might think of us. Some worry about the need for material things, and some are experiencing a big decision to step in, but we have fear and doubt that it would result in a boomerang effect on us, our families, or our loved ones. But God assures us to trust Him.</p>

                <p>We should take that fear and cast it, laying it all on our Father. He tells us to take all our worries and anxieties and give them all to God, who deeply cares for us. This is not a promise that He will fix everything like magic, as if we are commanding God to do it and fix it from our own perspective. It's not like that; we wanted God to solve our problems the way we wanted them to.</p>

                <p>We must trust Him completely; His ways are not our ways. God's way is far from man's way. God sees everythingâ€”our future, our past, our inner being, and all our inside and outside troubles in life because He was the one who made us. Whatever it takes, God will not lose us, just trust His ways. Even if we do not understand His means, just trust Him. Even our minds cannot comprehend; just trust Him. And even if things go wrong based on our own understanding, just trust Him, and God will show you His mighty hands, just like what He did in the land of Egypt. The Israelites got angry at Moses the first time he approached the Pharaoh because their burden in serving the Egyptians was multiplied. Even though we do not understand, trust Him. Like Moses, He puts His trust in leading the nation of Israel out of Egypt. That's why the Israelites witnessed the mighty acts and hands of God, and the world was astonished at the power displayed by the same God we are approaching now.</p>

                <p>Are you ready to give everything to Him? The moment you give that "all" to Him, do not hesitate to take it back. Do not fear; trust Him. Let God handle your cares in His own way. He knows the best, and He will do the best, but take note: while He is fixing those worries, allow God to fix your whole being too and lead you all the way until His coming, and your walk with Him will never be the same again.</p>

                <p style="color: red;">Repeat reading until you understand the guide reflection very well before you proceed with the steps below.</p>

                <p>1. Set your headset to your ear now...<br>
                  2. Max the volume so that you may hear everything... <br>
                  3. No one must see what you are doing. <br>
                  4. And if God moves you, then cry to Him about everything... <br>
                  5. And allow your heart to talk to God. <br> <br>
                  
                  Don't stop the feeling until God is finished with you.</p>
