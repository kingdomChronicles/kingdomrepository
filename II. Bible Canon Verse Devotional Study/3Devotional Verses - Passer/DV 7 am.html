                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
                <h2>Psalms 103:13</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Tranlation)</p>
                <p>
                  <sup>13</sup> The LORD is like a father to his children, tender and compassionate to those who fear him.
                </p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>Our God is a father who has full compassion for his children. "Compassion" is from a Hebrew word that implies action. It is an emotion that inspires action. As a father, he feels sympathy for us as his children. He knows the doom of His creation because of the entrance of sin. Thus, our heavenly Father is calling everyone to come to Him. He knows everyone of us, and he knows our present condition while we are here on earth. He knows that this world is under the dominion of the enemy, and we are all bombarded by Satan's attacks and schemes.</p>

                <p> Since birth, we have been born with a condition unworthy of His presence. That's because of the aftereffects of the sins committed by our ancestors, Adam and Eve. We are born with a deficiency. A deep feeling of longing. Many people today are looking for an answer to this mystery. Some look for an answer to satisfy this feeling of incompleteness through worldly things; others try to find happiness through the presence of friends, spouses, or family; at worst, some end up in bad or prohibited vices. But why does it seem that the sadness in our lives does not disappear? People have a feeling that something is missing from being a person. Others say that when they get married, they will be happy, but why are there so many married people who are not happy in life? Others say that they are happy if they have reached their dream and goals, but why are there so many people who have reached the pinnacle of success in worldly standard of life but still do not experience true happiness? It seems that there is still the feeling of being incomplete.</p>

                <p>Yes, something is indeed missing in our personalities. God, our Father, is the source of life. It is said that fish live in water. If you take the fish out of the water, it will die in minutes or hours. The tree lives in the ground, but if you pull the tree out of the ground, eventually the tree will wither and die too. It's the same with us, our life comes from God. So if God is not in our lives, we are like creatures that walk with no life at all. We are considered living dead. We need to be connected with the source of life, which is God, our Father.</p>

                <p>In Isaiah, the people cry out to God, "Yet You are our Father, even though Abraham does not know us and Israel doesnâ€™t recognize us. You, Yahweh, are our Father; from ancient times, "Yet LORD, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You are our potter; we all are the work of Your hands."  God is addressed as Father.</p>

                <p>Why do we call God our father? Jesus described God in two words: "Our Father." Jesus was saying that God is a person and not simply a power. As a person, we can relate to, love, and get to know him. This God we call Father is personally involved and intimate. He wants to have communion with his children. The Son came to introduce God the Father to humanity. To teach us to know God as the Father, He was nailed to the cross to restore our relationship with God, our Father.</p>

                <p>As the verse says, if we fear Him, we are entitled to call God our Father. <br><br>



                  But this evening, for your PM devotion, can you give God ample time to meet Him in person? If yes, then these are the things you need to do before you start your evening devotion.</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li> Go to a secluded place. No one should disturb you during the whole duration, from the start until God is finished with you.</li>
                    <li>If you have headphones, prepare them so that you can focus on your devotion. If you do not have one, then borrow one.</li>
                    <li> And last, have an expectant heart that this evening, God the Father will meet you in a personal way.</li>
                    <li> And if you are serious about meeting your God, after your prayer, you will feel a sensation that is very different from normal because your spirit is having such joy that cannot be explained, it is the joy of being reconnected with his maker.</li>
                    <li> Write your reflection now, and proclaim to the group how happy you are to meet your God, being a Father, this evening. You will know why he was called the following titles... <br>
                    A father to the Nation Israel, Righteous Father, Abba Father, Everlasting Father, Father of glory, The Living Father, Father of lights, Father of mercies, Father of spirits, Father of the Fatherless, and also your personal Father.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p></p>
