                <p> 
                    <sup>15</sup>  Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
                    <sup>16</sup> For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. 
                    <sup>17</sup> And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.

                  <sup>12</sup> The younger son told his father, ‘I want my share of your estate now before you die.’ So his father agreed to divide his wealth between his sons. 
                  <sup>13</sup> “A few days later this younger son packed all his belongings and moved to a distant land, and there he wasted all his money in wild living. 
                  <sup>14</sup> About the time his money ran out, a great famine swept over the land, and he began to starve. 
                  <sup>15</sup> He persuaded a local farmer to hire him, and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs. 
                  <sup>16</sup> The young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him. But no one gave him anything. 
                  <sup>17</sup> “When he finally came to his senses, he said to himself, ‘At home even the hired servants have food enough to spare, and here I am dying of hunger! 
                  <sup>18</sup> I will go home to my father and say, “Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, 
                  <sup>19</sup> and I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired servant.”’ 
                  <sup>20</sup> “So he returned home to his father. And while he was still a long way off, his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion, he ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him. 
                  <sup>21</sup> His son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, and I am no longer worthy of being called your son.’ 
                  <sup>22</sup> “But his father said to the servants, ‘Quick! Bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him. Get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet. 
                  <sup>23</sup> And kill the calf we have been fattening. We must celebrate with a feast, 
                  <sup>24</sup> for this son of mine was dead and has now returned to life. He was lost, but now he is found.’ So the party began.
