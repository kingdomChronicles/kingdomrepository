          <h2>1 Peter 5:7</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">Amp (Amplified Version)</p>
          <p>
              <sup>7</sup> casting all your cares [all your anxieties, all your worries, and all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares about you [with deepest affection, and watches over you very carefully].
          </p>



          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

          <p>Peter's words were a command. It is not God's will for His children to keep living under the problems of this world. This encourages us to believe that we are indeed overwhelmed by the challenges and worries around us. Through His Apostle Peter, God commands us to give our anxieties, fears, and worries to Him. Sometimes we are afraid that if we give these things to Him, others might judge us. Some worry about needing material things, and some have big decisions to make but fear it might backfire on them or their loved ones. But God assures us to trust Him.</p>

          <p>We should take that fear and cast it, giving it all to our Father. He tells us to take all our worries and anxieties and give them to God, who deeply cares for us. This is not a promise that He will fix everything magically, as if we are commanding God to do it our way. It's not like that; let God solve our problems His way.</p>

          <p>We must trust Him completely; His ways are not our ways. God's way is different from man's way. God sees everything—our future, our past, our inner being, and all our troubles because He made us. Whatever it takes, God will not lose us, so just trust His ways. Even if we do not understand His methods, just trust Him. Even if our minds cannot comprehend, just trust Him. And even if things go wrong based on our understanding, just trust Him, and God will show you His mighty hands, just like what He did in Egypt. The Israelites were angry at Moses the first time he approached the Pharaoh because their burden in serving the Egyptians increased. Even though we do not understand, trust Him. Like Moses, he put his trust in leading the nation of Israel out of Egypt. That's why the Israelites witnessed the mighty acts and hands of God, and the world was amazed at the power displayed by the same God we approach now.</p>

          <p>Are you ready to give everything to Him? When you give it all to Him, do not hesitate to take it back. Do not fear; trust Him. Let God handle your cares His way. He knows the best and will do the best, but remember: while He is fixing those worries, allow God to fix your whole being too and lead you all the way until His coming, and your walk with Him will never be the same again.</p>

          <p style="color: red;">Read the reflection guide carefully until you understand it well. Once you're ready, follow these steps:</p>

          <p>1. Put your headset on your ears...<br>
            2. Turn the volume up so you can hear everything clearly... <br>
            3. Make sure no one can see what you are doing.<br>
            4. If you feel moved by God, cry out to Him about everything... <br>
            5. Let your heart talk to God.<br> <br>
            
            Don't stop feeling until God is finished with you.</p>
