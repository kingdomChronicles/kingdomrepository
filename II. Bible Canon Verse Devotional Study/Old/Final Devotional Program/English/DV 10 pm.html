      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>Matthew 13:45-46</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
      
      <p>           
        <sup>45</sup>  “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, 
        <sup>46</sup> who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it. 
      </p>


      <br><hr>
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

    <p>Why does Jesus use the analogy of a merchant? What does a merchant do? <br><br>

        Consider how people earn a living. People often exchange their time and effort for a paycheck at the end of the week.<br><br>
        
        Some individuals spend many years acquiring skills or knowledge, which they then trade for money. A merchant, however, trades knowledge for money. Unlike others, he doesn’t rely solely on physical labor or trading his time for money to gain wealth. <br><br>
        
        Instead, he relies on his understanding of the commodity he trades—in this case, pearls. Similarly, one does not enter the kingdom of God through hard work or extensive knowledge about religion. Entry into the kingdom comes through knowing a person, specifically Christ. It’s not what you know that justifies you, but who you know. <br><br>
    
        The merchant, representing you and me, engages in four actions: first, he seeks; then, he finds; next, he sells all his possessions; and finally, he buys what he has found. Everyone’s journey is unique.</p><br><br>


    <p><b>The Merchant Goes Out Seeking</b></p>

    <p>Many people are searching for truth and genuine spirituality. <br><br>

    Some may stumble upon the truth of God accidentally.<br><br>
    
    Nowadays, many are seeking a spirituality that is transformative and provides assurance.<br><br>
    
    God places a desire within us to find answers to the numerous questions we encounter about life.<br><br>
    
    Some of these questions include how and where we can find a genuine spiritual experience.<br><br>
    
    Many are searching for spirituality in various places, sometimes traveling far and wide to find something that will satisfy their spiritual cravings.<br><br>
    
    Some explore different spiritual experiences like Buddhism and Hinduism, or various religions that teach spirituality, but still fail to find inner satisfaction.<br><br>
    
    We, who study the Word of God, are blessed because God has found us. He sees our inner being and knows we are seeking the true experience that only He can provide. <br><br>

    Finally, we are the merchants who have found the pearl of great price. <br><br>

You are among those who responded immediately, which is why you have come this far in your search. <br><br>

There is an undeniable truth to the Gospel of the Kingdom of God. When one hears it, they find and experience the grace and mercy of God in Christ Jesus. <br><br>

If you are a seeker, it is suggested that you closely examine the pearl and explore the truths of what God has done for you and continually what He can do for you. <br><br>

The man seeking pearls represents someone who doesn’t just stumble upon the truth; he actively engages in thoughtful seeking. <br><br>

Some people avoid deep consideration. It’s challenging to focus on thinking through a dilemma or problem, searching for an answer. It takes time and energy to stay focused while diligently exploring. <br><br>

The enemy of our souls (Satan) will try to keep us busy with trivial and unimportant things to distract us and keep us unaware of the things of God. <br><br>

Nothing should be more important to you than seeking to find the pearl of great value (Jesus and the Kingdom of God). <br><br>

A merchant whose life focus was pearls would travel wherever necessary to find gems. <br><br>

He would move along the coastline, asking pearl divers and fishermen, "Do you have any pearls?" <br><br>

These jewels were the purpose of his life. His life had a goal and a mission. <br><br>

This merchant’s energy and focus were dedicated entirely to finding pearls.<br><br>

The merchant took time and effort to develop the skill of recognizing a good pearl when he found one. <br><br>

Similarly, the things of God do not come to those who are half-hearted but to those who actively pursue and seek the Lord. <br><br>

What does this mean? We find God through thoughtful reflection, prayer, turning our hearts toward Him, submitting our will to Him, and paying attention to His Word. <br><br>

Ultimately, it all comes down to the question: <br><br>

What do we value?<br><br>

When someone finds Christ and His kingdom, like the merchant who found the pearl of Great price.<br><br>

His search was complete.<br><br>

All of God's riches are found in Christ. This search is universal.<br><br>

All people have the same spiritual longings and yearn for the same fulfillment.<br><br>

The pearls that the merchant sought symbolize this search.<br><br>

The question now is, how do we acquire it?</p><br><br>



<p><b>The Merchant Finds a Pearl of Great Worth</b></p>

<p>While the man is searching, he comes across one colossal pearl worth infinitely more than all the pearls he had ever bought before. The merchant was amazed at his find! He could scarcely believe his good fortune, for this remarkable pearl was unlike anything he had ever seen. Its beauty was captivating. It is true that when one is diligent in seeking good things, God will meet them along the way. Put yourself “in the way” and seek Him with all your heart. All that is lovely and pure is found in the Lord Jesus Christ. <br><br>

We do not know the exact value of the pearl of great price, but the merchant knew it was the most significant deal of a lifetime. He knew it would cost him greatly. He sat down and considered what he would have to give up. He would have no capital left to continue buying pearls. That alone would change many aspects of his life.<br><br>

The moment you come across the Pearl of Great Price, your soul will find its rest. <br><br>

To experience everything the Pearl offers, we must trade everything we have. We need to offer our whole being to Him to experience the true essence of inner rest for our soul.<br><br>

The moment you surrender everything to Him, your life will completely turn around.<br><br>

When you finally find what your soul has been longing for, internal changes take place.<br><br>

You will suddenly realize that many things from your old life are no longer relevant.<br><br>

There is an inner joy that floods your soul after years of searching for the truth about the world, your identity, and your purpose in life.<br><br>

When the man found the pearl of great price, he resolved within his heart that he would have it.<br><br>

Nothing would stand in his way of obtaining it.<br><br>

This attitude reflects the heart of a person who pleases God, someone with a strong resolve that nothing should stop them from having a relationship with Christ and entering His heavenly kingdom. <br><br>

The divine exchange is to give your sins and burdens to Him, and in return, He will clothe you with His righteousness. As stated in the letter to the Corinthians:<br><br>

<i>“God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” </i></p><br><br>


<p><b>The Merchant Sold All That He Had</b></p>

<p>When the merchant realized the value of the pearl before him, he decided that the only way to acquire it was to sell all he had.<br><br>

Consider the process for the merchant. He likely went home and held a garage sale—everything must go! His car, his boat, his house.<br><br>

Nothing would stop him from obtaining that valuable pearl. If that was the price, he would gladly pay it! He got rid of the satellite television, the laptop, his smartphone and everything he has.<br><br>

He cashed in all his stocks, pension plan, everything! Then, he put up signs in the neighborhood to sell the house for a quick sale.<br><br>

Why a quick sale?<br><br>


Because salvation is NOW. <br><br>

What does it mean to give up everything? <br><br>

Let us not stubbornly hold on to any part of ourselves that is not under God's rule.<br><br>

If you still have fear, surrender it to God.<br><br>
If you still have doubt, surrender it to God.<br><br>
If you still have worries, surrender them to God.<br><br>

Anything that can be used against you to hinder you from attaining true salvation, anything that hinders you from entering His Kingdom, cast them all aside. Let God lead you, for He holds your future and destiny if He is the One leading your life.<br><br>

When we enter into a covenant relationship with the God of the Universe, we relinquish ownership of everything we have. As what the Letter to the Corinthians said,<br><br>

<i> “You are not your own; you were bought at a price.”</i><br><br>

We are no longer owners but stewards of what God possesses. From the moment we give our lives to Christ, we become managers of the things we once owned. Christ is now the boss.<br><br>

Even if you disagree with what you see, what your hear, what you feel and what you think, your role is to obey the boss.<br><br>

<i> “Not my will, Lord, but thy will be done.”</i></p><br><br>


<p><b>The Merchant Buys the Pearl of Great Price</b></p>

<p>We now come to the fourth action the merchant takes. He uses the money he earned from selling his possessions to buy the pearl. He experiences great joy in doing so, not thinking about the cost. Such is the pleasure of acquiring that pearl.<br><br>

If you have given up everything just to have the exact amount to buy the Pearl of Great Price, then you will have it.<br><br>

In the coming days, God will remind you of the things you need to surrender to Him. Whenever fear, doubt, confusion, or anything that causes turmoil or confusion arises, surrender everything to Him. Let Him own you and let God lead you in all your ways.<br><br>

Until you experience the spiritual Kingdom of God here on earth. A life complete and a life of joy.<br><br>

The question is, are you willing to undergo all the process of God?</p>
