                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
                <h2>James 1:22-25</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
                <p>
                   <sup>22</sup> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. 
                   <sup>23</sup> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror 
                   <sup>24</sup> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. 
                   <sup>25</sup> But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.
                </p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><b>Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.</b> <br>
                  He said that we shouldn't simply listen to His Words; it's crucial that we should follow all of the Lord's instructions. We shouldn't treat it like a restaurant menu, picking and choosing what we like and ignoring what we don't. Every part of the scriptures is meant for us. The scriptures are given to help us grow strong as we navigate life. No matter what challenges we face, we will succeed because we know that God is always with those who respect Him and obey His words.</p>

                <p><b>Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.
                </b> <br>
                This verse serves as a warning to those who seek to draw near to God. We must avoid becoming like those mentioned in this verse, where upon hearing His word, it quickly leaves our minds. It's like listening with our right ear and letting it slip out of our left. It's similar to looking at ourselves in a mirror: while we're looking, we're pleased and we clean any dirt we see on our face, but as soon as we turn away, we forget our appearance. This is like people who are joyful on worship days, some even moved to tears by the beautiful songs and sermons, but once the service ends, they revert to their old selves, disregarding God's will and His daily instructions.</p>

                <p><b> But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.

                </b> <br>
                The verse emphasizes the importance of diligently studying and obeying God's perfect law. The writer emphasizes the power and significance of God's words when we put them into practice. It assures freedom and blessings for those who do so. By reading, meditating on, and consistently living by these words, we can experience God's presence in our daily lives. This enables us to sense God's guidance even in small matters because He values and loves those who trust, fear, and obey Him.</p>

            <p>Many churchgoers or attendees of fellowship services seek and praise God according to religious rituals or denominational practices. We often become complacent, believing that our actions are sufficient to earn God's approval of our worship. Sometimes, we compare ourselves to others within the church, thinking that we can emulate their wrongdoings and still be saved, even if those actions are sinful or contrary to the morals outlined in God's Word. Our worship is frequently based solely on what we observe in the church, leading us to mimic the behaviors of other worshippers without considering if this form of worship aligns with His teachings. This adherence to religious rituals and traditions prevents God in redeeming and transforming our lives.</p>

            <p><b>Wake up!</b> This is one of our serious mistake. God is instructing us to heed only to His Word, not the words of those around us. Revisit everything from the beginning of our Bible devotion program and concentrate solely on His word. If your spirit discerns that what you are hearing or seeing does not align with His Word, return to the Word of God and seek the truth. We all make mistakes; even brothers, sisters in the church, and pastors can err, especially if they are not firmly rooted in the Words of God because they too are only human. Do not heed them or anyone else if what they are saying and teaching contradicts God's word.</p>

            <p>You are now growing stronger in your spiritual journey through your daily meditation to His word. Stay firmly grounded in Him. Avoid straying or distancing yourself from Him by neglecting to read His Words; instead, let Him lead you in every step. Maintain regular communication with Him through prayer and daily devotion. Cultivate a personal relationship with Him because He always desires to hear the words of our hearts.</p>
