          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
          <H2>1 John 3:4-6</H2>
          <p class="chapterTitle"> NIV (New International Version)</p>
          <p>
              <sup>4</sup> Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness. 
              <sup>5</sup> But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin. 
              <sup>6</sup> No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.
          </p>


          <br><hr>

          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>
          <p><b><sup>4</sup> 4 Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.</b> <br><br>

          In verse 4, sin is defined as lawlessness. This highlights our deliberate deviation from God's moral law and standard of righteousness. It emphasizes that sin is not just a mistake but a conscious violation of God's divine order.<br><br>

          Did you know that in the Old Testament, there was no offering for intentional sin? God only forgave unintentional sins, so He taught the Israelites rituals for seeking forgiveness for these unintentional sins. However, those who sinned intentionally faced immediate punishment according to the laws God gave to Moses.<br><br>

          Understanding sin requires us to continually examine ourselves. We need to reflect on our actions and intentions to recognize where we might have strayed from God's righteous path.</p> <br><br>


          <p><b><sup>5</sup> But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin.</b> <br><br>

          In verse 5, this passage shows us the sinless nature of Christ: He came to take away our sins because He has no sin. This emphasizes why Christ became human, as He is the only person with a sinless nature. This qualifies Him as the perfect sacrifice for our sins, making Him the ideal offering to remove them.<br><br>

          For true believers, this passage reminds us of the deep love and grace God has for all of us.</p> <br><br>


          <p><b><sup>6</sup> No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.
          </b> <br><br>
       
         This is a big challenge for those who want to seriously follow God's direction: Whoever remains in Him doesn't keep sinning, and whoever keeps committing intentional sins doesn't really know Him and have no real encounter with Him. <br><br>
         
         If we continue to live in repeatitive sins, we need to sincerely ask for forgiveness and seek the mercy of the Lord God to save us because, in this state, we are only proving that we are still under the power of Satan, the god of this world. And if you are still under Satan, it only proves that you are still included in God's punishments upon His return.<br><br>
         
         We should take this situation seriously so that we do not reach a point of regret where it is too late. Instead, we should ask God to forgive all our sins and truly repent so that we can walk according to His righteousness.<br><br>

          We must always strive to live with righteousness, holiness, and purity in our hearts. We should ask God to give us discernment so that all our actions show our close relationship with Him. Let's continue to grow in our knowledge of God so we can carefully follow all His instructions and live a victorious life against all the schemes of the enemy (Satan).<br><br>

          A true believer remains in Him and follows His words. So let us continue to study His Word so that we will not be led astray. Because we are called to live righteously and to continue to move away from sinful living. Amen.</p>
