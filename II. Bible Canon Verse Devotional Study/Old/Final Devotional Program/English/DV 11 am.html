          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

          <h2>Matthew 6:9-10</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
          <p> 
            <sup>9</sup>  “Pray, then, in this way: ‘Our Father, who is in heaven, Hallowed be Your name.
            <sup>10</sup> Your kingdom come, Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven.  
          </p>

          
          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>
    
    
          <p>This prayer is known  all over the world as "the Lord's Prayer". Even many people who don't submit to God know this prayer and find it comforting or meaningful to say in times of trouble. <br><br>
    
            For us who are learning about God's Kingdom, this prayer has a deeper meaning. <br><br>
            
            We who are called by God, praying for this prayer to come to reality. <br><br>
            
            God is already reigning in Heaven, where His rule is complete. In Heaven, everyone fully obeys God's will. All spiritual beings, all of His creation that resides in heaven, including angels, completely follow their King, who is God Himself the One who created heaven and earth. <br><br>
            
           
            <b><sup>10</sup> Your kingdom come, Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven.</b> <br><br>

            All of God's creations on earth follow His will. The birds, animals, seas, and mountains adhere to their designated purposes. <br><br>

            Only Humans, the highest of His creations, continually disobey God's will. Not only do they disobey, but they also destroy the order of God's creation, following the desires of their flesh and the influence of the god of this world(satan).<br><br>

            We know that everything has an end. The day will come when God will put an end to satan's evil. At the appointed time, God will cast satan and all the people he has deceived into the lake of fire.<br><br>

            How will the Kingdom of God reign on earth? It will happen when people, who are the highest of all God's creations, start to acknowledge the rulership of their King.<br><br>

            It will start in the hearts of those whom He has called, but only those who respond to His call will be chosen.<br><br>
            
            <i>"Truly, many are called but few are chosen"</i><br><br>
            
            
            They will be the ones in whom God will begin His reign on earth. <br><br>

            How can we become part of His chosen?<br><br>

            Christ Himself demonstrated the importance of submitting to God's will when He became flesh; He lived in perfect obedience to His Father's will.<br><br>

            God's chosen people are the means by which this prayer becomes a reality.<br><br>

            Praying for what God desires means accepting His will and plan for the earth and everyone on it.<br><br>

            Jesus prayed for God's kingdom to come and His will to be done everywhere and at all times.<br><br>

            To pray sincerely for this is to request from God the very thing Jesus came to achieve: bringing the kingdom of heaven to earth.<br><br>

            Pray to God for a heart open to learning, one that will truly embrace all teachings about God's reign and the ways of His Kingdom.<br><br>

            Pray as Jesus did, asking God to reign in your heart and in your entire being at all times.<br><br>

            Pray to God to reign in your heart and to use you as His instrument in establishing His Kingdom on earth.</p><br><br>

            <p><b><sup>9</sup>  “Pray, then, in this way: ‘Our Father, who is in heaven, Hallowed be Your name.</b> <br><br>
            
            Remember, when we pray to our Father in heaven, we should always think about the fact that we are approaching the throne of the Great King, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, and the God worshiped by the whole universe.<br><br>

            We should give Him the highest praise, worship, and respect, and lift Him up completely.<br><br>
            
            This is the right way to approach our Father whenever we pray to Him.<br><br>
            
            Because hypocritical approaches and worship to God will be ignored.<br><br>
            Hypocritical prayers will not be heard.<br><br>
            And God sees those who claim to serve Him but act wickedly or disobey His commands as enemies of goodness and His kingdom.<br><br>

            <p>Pray sincerely as you are about to end your devotion.</p>

            <p><i>Listening to uplifting music can help prepare your heart and mind for prayer. It can also be a beautiful way to connect with God before you begin praying. </i> </p>
  
            <p><i>If you have a headset then better use one and feel God's presence while you pray. </i></p>
