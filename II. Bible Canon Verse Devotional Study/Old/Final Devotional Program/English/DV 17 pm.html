          <h2>Luke 15:11-24</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          <p>
               
            <sup>11</sup> To illustrate the point further, Jesus told them this story: “A man had two sons. 
            <sup>12</sup> The younger son told his father, ‘I want my share of your estate now before you die.’ So his father agreed to divide his wealth between his sons. 
            <sup>13</sup> “A few days later this younger son packed all his belongings and moved to a distant land, and there he wasted all his money in wild living. 
            <sup>14</sup> About the time his money ran out, a great famine swept over the land, and he began to starve. 
            <sup>15</sup> He persuaded a local farmer to hire him, and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs. 
            <sup>16</sup> The young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him. But no one gave him anything. 
            <sup>17</sup> “When he finally came to his senses, he said to himself, ‘At home even the hired servants have food enough to spare, and here I am dying of hunger! 
            <sup>18</sup> I will go home to my father and say, “Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, 
            <sup>19</sup> and I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired servant.”’ 
            <sup>20</sup> “So he returned home to his father. And while he was still a long way off, his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion, he ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him. 
            <sup>21</sup> His son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, and I am no longer worthy of being called your son.’ 
            <sup>22</sup> “But his father said to the servants, ‘Quick! Bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him. Get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet. 
            <sup>23</sup> And kill the calf we have been fattening. We must celebrate with a feast, 
            <sup>24</sup> for this son of mine was dead and has now returned to life. He was lost, but now he is found.’ So the party began.

          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

          <p>The story of the Prodigal Son highlights the forgiving nature of the father, who represents God and stays consistent throughout. Jesus, by narrating this story, aligns himself with God's loving nature towards the lost, symbolized by the younger son, who stands for sinners. The main message of this parable revolves around restoring a fractured relationship with the Father. We see in this story the graciousness of the father overshadowing the sinfulness of the son, as it is the memory of the father’s goodness that brings the prodigal son to repentance.
        </p><br><br>

        <p><b> <sup>11</sup> To illustrate the point further, Jesus told them this story: “A man had two sons. <sup>12</sup> The younger son told his father, ‘I want my share of your estate now before you die.’ So his father agreed to divide his wealth between his sons.
        </b> <br><br>
    
        The younger son asked his father for his portion of the estate, which would be half of what his older brother would receive. In other words, the younger son requested one-third of the estate.<br><br>

        Although he had the right to ask, it was unloving because it implied he wished his father were dead.<br><br>

        Rather than rebuking his son, the father patiently granted his request. This illustrates how God allows a sinner to choose his own path.

    </p><br><br>

    <p><b><sup>13</sup> “A few days later this younger son packed all his belongings and moved to a distant land, and there he wasted all his money in wild living.
    </b> <br><br>

    The younger son travels to a distant country. His previous actions showed that he had already made that journey in his heart, and his physical departure was a clear sign of his willful disobedience to all the goodness of his father.<br><br>

    Like the prodigal son, we all have a foolish desire to be independent, which is the root of a sinner continuing in his sin. A sinful state is a departure and distance from God. It is also a place of constant discontent.<br><br>

    If the younger son were to narrate his speach to this story...<br><br>

    <i>Father, I don’t want to live in your house anymore. Your rules suffocate me. I want to be free; I want to be my own boss. I will decide where I go, who I am with, and what I do whenever I want. I don’t want anyone telling me what to do. I want to live in a way that pleases me. I want to be free from any rules.</i>

</p><br><br>

    <p><b><sup>15</sup> About the time his money ran out, a great famine swept over the land, and he began to starve. <sup>15</sup> He persuaded a local farmer to hire him, and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs. 
    </b> <br><br>

    In the foreign land, the prodigal son squanders all his inheritance on selfish, shallow pleasures, losing everything. His financial ruin is followed by a natural disaster, a famine, which he did not foresee.<br><br>

    Like many people who seek freedom their own way,<br>
    they end up becoming slaves to Satan.<br>
    They find themselves working in pig fields,<br>
    in the mud, representing the depths of sin and the filthiness of this world.<br><br>

    When we go out and do things our own way, we end up doing every wrong thing.
    We are led away from God, losing ourselves to drugs, alcoholism, gambling, and similar vices.
    We do everything wrong. Because the moment we choose our way over God's way, we destroy all the beautiful things God has given us. <br><br>

    What is sad about this is that we drag God's name through the mud, desecrating God as our Creator. <br><br>

    If you say you know God but still do these things or have done these things, it means at that moment, you are bringing great shame to your God, your Creator.<br><br>

    <i>We desecrate God’s highest creation by ruining our own lives.</i>

</p><br><br>

    <p><b><sup>16</sup> The young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him. But no one gave him anything.
    </b> <br><br>

    At this point, he hires himself out to a Gentile and finds himself feeding pigs, a detestable job to the Jewish people. The prodigal must have been incredibly desperate to willingly take such a loathsome position. He was paid so little and grew so hungry that he longed to eat the pig’s food. To make matters worse, he found no mercy among the people he had chosen as his own: “No one gave him anything.”<br><br>

    The prodigal son toiling in the pig pen is a picture of the lost sinner or a rebellious Christian who has returned to a life of sin. The results of sin are never pretty.<br><br>

    Once his wealth was gone, so were his friends. Even the unclean animals were better off than he was at that point. Even Satan, whom he chose to follow, would laugh at him because that is what Satan wants—to destroy lives.
</p><br><br>

    <p><b><sup>17</sup>  “When he finally came to his senses, he said to himself, ‘At home even the hired servants have food enough to spare, and here I am dying of hunger!
    </b> <br><br>

    The prodigal’s realization mirrors the sinner’s discovery that, apart from God, there is no hope.<br><br>

    When a sinner “comes to his senses,” repentance follows, along with a longing to return to fellowship with God.
</p><br><br>

    <p><b><sup>18</sup> I will go home to my father and say, “Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, <sup>19</sup> and I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired servant.”’
    </b><br><br>

    The son comes up with a plan, which signifies genuine repentance.<br><br>

    He will admit his sin and give up his rights as a son to become a servant.<br><br>

    He knows he doesn't deserve any blessings from his father and has nothing to offer except a life of service. Returning home, the prodigal son is ready to fall at his father’s feet and beg for mercy.<br><br>

    In the same way, a repentant sinner coming to God understands their own spiritual poverty. Putting aside all pride and feelings of entitlement, they bring nothing of value with them.<br><br>

    The sinner's only thought is to throw themselves at God's mercy and beg for a position of servitude.
</p><br><br>

    <p><b><sup>20</sup> “So he returned home to his father. And while he was still a long way off, his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion, he ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him.
    </b><br><br>

    The father in the Parable of the Prodigal Son was waiting for his son to return. In fact, “while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him.”<br><br>

    He runs to his wayward son, embraces him, and kisses him. In Jesus’ day, it was not customary for a grown man to run, yet the father runs to greet his son, breaking tradition in his love and desire for restoration.
    </p><br><br>

    <p><b><sup>21</sup> His son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, and I am no longer worthy of being called your son.’
    </b><br><br>

    The returning son begins his prepared speech, but his father cuts him off before he can finish.<br><br>

    The father doesn't question or lecture his son; instead, he joyfully forgives him and welcomes him back into fellowship.<br><br>
    
    What a picture of God’s love, condescension, and grace! God's heart is full of compassion for His children; He stands ready to welcome the returning sinner back home with a joyous celebration.
    </p><br><br>

    <p><b><sup>22</sup> “But his father said to the servants, ‘Quick! Bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him. Get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet.
    </b><br><br>

    The father’s command to bring the <u>best robe</u> for the returned son signifies dignity and honor, proof of the prodigal’s acceptance back into the family.<br><br>

    The <u>ring</u> for the son’s hand signifies authority and sonship.<br><br>
    
    The <u>sandals</u> for his feet signify that he is not a servant, as servants did not wear shoes on those time.
    </p><br><br>

    <p><b><sup>23</sup> And kill the calf we have been fattening. We must celebrate with a feast,
    </b><br><br>

    The father orders the fattened calf to be prepared, and a party is held in honor of the returned son.<br><br>

    Fatted calves in those times were saved for special occasions.<br><br>

    This was not just any party; it was a rare and grand celebration.
</p><br><br>

    <p><b><sup>24</sup> for this son of mine was dead and has now returned to life. He was lost, but now he is found.’ So the party began.
    </b><br><br>

    All these things represent what we receive in Christ upon salvation: <br>
    the robe of the Redeemer’s righteousness, <br>
    the privilege of partaking of the Spirit of adoption,<br> 
    and feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace, prepared to walk in the ways of holiness.<br><br>

    The actions of the father in the parable show us that “the Lord does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities" so long we come back to Him in spirit and in truth.<br><br>
    
    For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.<br><br>
    
    As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him”. Instead of condemnation, there is rejoicing for a son who “was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found”.<br><br>
    
    Those words—dead and alive, lost and found—are terms that also apply to one’s state before and after conversion to Christ.<br><br>
    
    The feast is a picture of what occurs in heaven over one repentant sinner.
    </p><br><br>

    <p><b>Conclusion:</b> <br><br>
    
    The prodigal son was content to return home as a slave, but to his surprise and joy, he is fully reinstated as his father’s son. The tired, emaciated, filthy sinner who made his way home is transformed into the honored guest in a wealthy man’s house.<br><br>

    That is what God’s grace accomplishes for a repentant sinner. Not only are we forgiven in Christ, but we also receive the Spirit of "adoption to sonship." We become His children, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.<br><br>

    We are invited to take a moment to watch a music video and pray with sincere humility and repentance for all our shortcomings, sins, and transgressions against His will. This is your opportunity to return to God through your heartfelt prayer to Him.
