                <h2>Deuteronomy 30:11-14</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
                <p> 
                    <sup>11</sup>“For this commandment that I command you today is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. 
                    <sup>12</sup>It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?''
                    <sup>13</sup>Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?'
                    <sup>14</sup>But the word is very near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you can do it.
                </p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><b><sup>11</sup>“For this commandment that I command you today is not too hard for you, neither is it far off.</b> <br>
                  
                  This was the covenant that God made with Israel when God freed them from the slavery of Egypt. In our present time, as we progress in our devotional study, our eyes were opened, and God freed us from the slavery of Satan and his deception. He has also opened our eyes to see the goodness of God's love for us. God is telling us now that His word is not that mysterious or hard to understand, and that His word is not far off. <br><br>

                  God is telling the Israelites that they can indeed keep the commandments, though God was not expecting from them the impossible; He just wants them to keep them and have delight from them. As we progress, we are also going further away from the bondage of Egypt. Our Egypt is the enslavement of Satan to us. God is bringing us closer to His light and the beauty of being with the Lord. God is also telling us now that His commandment is not too hard if we only have an open and teachable heart towards Him. Instead of burden, it will turn all into joy.</p> <br>


                  <p><b><sup>12</sup>It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?''
                    <sup>13</sup>Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?'</b> <br>

                    All of us thought before that His word was impossible to understand, impossible to follow, impossible to keep, and impossible to obey. Because all we know is that it is as far as heaven or as deep as the sea, there are certain requirements just for us to read and understand it. That's why many of us have failed on our intention to read our Bible, to the point that many of us make this commitment as one of our New Year's resolutions but still fail to implement it, or many of us have read it but cannot apply its word and power to our lives because we are approaching God through our head knowledge or our own understanding and intelligence only. <br><br>

                    That's the reason why we are constantly bombarded with problems and deceptions coming from the enemy, because we are still walking in darkness, the power of His word is not yet manifested in our daily lives, and the enemy is free to do anything he wants with us. But now God is opening our eyes for us to see the enemy's schemes, lies, and deceptions, while at the same time, God is opening our eyes to see the beauty of being in His presence. </p> <br>


                <p><b><sup>14</sup>But the word is very near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you can do it.</b> <br>

                  God never expected Israel to perfectly obey the law and find righteousness through obedience to the law. He just wanted them to keep it and let them experience the joy of having it—let them experience God the Messiah behind the law. <br><br>

                  Today, we are also commanded to keep His words and to experience the presence of the Messiah behind His words. He never expected us to obey everything written on it at once. Little by little, as God is teaching us and instructing us on His ways, He is also showing the light of His word so that we may keep and obey it with joy. That it will not be a burden anymore but an act of love and obedience to our intention of serving Him and accepting Him as our Lord, King, and Savior of our lives.</p> <br>
