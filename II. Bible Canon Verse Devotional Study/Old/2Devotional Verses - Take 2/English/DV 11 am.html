                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
                <h2>Deuteronomy 30:15-18</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
                <p> 
                    <sup>15</sup>“See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil.                     
                    <sup>16</sup>If you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you today, by loving the LORD your God, by walking in his ways, and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his rules, then you shall live and multiply, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to take possession of it.                     
                    <sup>17</sup>But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them,                     
                    <sup>18</sup>I declare to you today, that you shall surely perish. You shall not live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to enter and possess.                     
                </p>

                                

                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><b><sup>15</sup>“See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil. </b> <br> <br>

                  Under this term, God spoke to the Israelites through Moses. God is saying to them, Israel, you had a choice: life or death, good or evil. It was up to them. God was going to glorify Himself through Israel one way or another. How it would happen was really their choice. <br> <br>

                  The same is true for us now. As you study and meditate on His words, God is also giving us a choice: either to choose Him or to deny Him. If we choose God, then we choose light, goodness, life, and life eternal. But if we deny God, then we have already made a choice; we chose death, evil, and darkness, and later on, judgment will be upon us. We have always had a choice, but our default, as we have meditated in our previous devotional study, is that all have sinned and fall short of His glory, and we also know that the wages of sin is death. <br><br>

                  Again, the choice is ours; choices will not be made by our mouths alone but by how we live by His words. We cannot proclaim to Him that, Lord, we are choosing you; it should be proven through our actions, a continuous lifestyle, and the covering of His words. This is a reminder to us that our choice is made through our actions and not by our lips alone.</p> <br>

                  <p><b><sup>16</sup>If you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you today, by loving the LORD your God, by walking in his ways, and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his rules, then you shall live and multiply, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to take possession of it. </b><br> <br>

                    The choice here is being reiterated: if we choose life, then we must be obedient to His words. Serving God must not be a burden to us, but the outcome of our love for Him. Keeping His commandments, His statutes, and His rules must be done with a joyful heart. Everything you do for the Lord will always bring you joy and happiness. Serving Him and doing things for Him with joy and thanksgiving is the fruit of having God in our hearts. <br><br>

                    This devotional program is teaching us how to grow in our love for Him. Do we consider this devotional program an obligation or just a responsibility to fulfill? This is not a church program; this is not a sort of earthly activity, so we must comply with its requirements. We are doing this because we love God, meaning there is no single reason for us to complain and make excuses not to follow it, and if we are to complain, we are not complaining to anyone but to God. God is training us and disciplining us through His Words on how to walk in Him.</p> <br>

                  <p><b><sup>17</sup>But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them,                     
                    <sup>18</sup>I declare to you today, that you shall surely perish. You shall not live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to enter and possess. </b> <br> <br>
                   
                    But if you turn away or deny Him, it's like turning away as if you were to worship other gods; then you have already made a choice, and soon the evil result will be upon you. Let us all remember that all who deny God will someday be cast on the Lake of Fire, where there is gnashing of teeth, eternal fire, and an eternal torment.<br><br>

                    <b>The choice is yours!!!</b></p><br>
