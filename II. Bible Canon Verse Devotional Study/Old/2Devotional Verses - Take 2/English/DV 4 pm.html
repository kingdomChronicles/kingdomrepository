                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
                <h2>Proverbs 20:9</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
                <p><sup>6</sup> Who can say, “I have made my heart pure; I am clean from my sin”?</p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>Who can you trust entirely? No one, especially not yourself!  You will increase in wisdom when you start to learn to mistrust yourself. Only fools trust their own motives and thoughts.</p> 

                <p>Can you answer the proverb's question? Human hearts are naturally corrupt, and their motives are impure. The Bible, the inspired holy book of Christians, teaches that all humans have perverse hearts and selfish motives. Since the fall in the Garden of Eden, all humans, by nature, despise God and righteousness, choosing instead to love sin and evil.</p>  
                
                <p>The human heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, beyond your ability to fully understand. Accept this harsh reality! No one can overcome this internal curse that distorts their thoughts and corrupts their motives.</p>

                <p>What is the lesson here? The proverb is plain and straightforward: humanity is depraved, foolish, sinful, and wicked, and it cannot redeem itself. Understanding human nature as inherently foolish and depraved is crucial for wisdom. As Paul wrote, "Let God be true, and every man a liar."</p>

                <p>You also can't trust your own opinions or thoughts. Your judgment could be very wrong because of your corrupt heart. That's why it's very wrong to seek counsel from people who despise God's Word. After all, what good advice can come from a heart that is naturally corrupt?</p>

                <p>The human heart cannot be rehabilitated; it must be completely recreated. Perfection cannot be attained in this life; one must await the power of heaven. Even the most virtuous individuals and their noblest deeds are marred by the lingering corruption in their earthly existence.</p>

                <p>That's why we are instructed to consistently seek and ground ourselves in His Words, which serve as our radar and guide to protect our thoughts and inner intentions. Always align your thoughts with the Scriptures rather than human opinions.</p>

                <p>The sole hope for you or anyone else lies in God's grace and the resurrection power of Jesus Christ to give you a new heart. Only through Jesus Christ's creative power can people receive a new heart of righteousness and holiness, capable of true wisdom. This underscores that without God, we are nothing.</p>
