                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
                <h2>Romans 7:15-20</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
                <p> 
                  <sup>15</sup> For I do not understand my own actions [I am baffled and bewildered by them]. I do not practice what I want to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate [and yielding to my human nature, my worldliness-my sinful capacity]. 
                  <sup>16</sup> Now if I habitually do what I do not want to do, [that means] I agree with the Law, confessing that it is good (morally excellent). 
                  <sup>17</sup> So now [if that is the case, then] it is no longer I who do it [the disobedient thing which I despise], but the sin [nature] which lives in me. 
                  <sup>18</sup> For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh [my human nature, my worldliness—my sinful capacity]. For the willingness [to do good] is present in me, but the doing of good is not. 
                  <sup>19</sup> For the good that I want to do, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. 
                  <sup>20</sup> But if I am doing the very thing I do not want to do, I am no longer the one doing it [that is, it is not me that acts], but the sin [nature] which lives in me.
                </p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><b><sup>15</sup> For I do not understand my own actions [I am baffled and bewildered by them]. I do not practice what I want to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate [and yielding to my human nature, my worldliness-my sinful capacity].</b> <br><br>

                  Paul is genuinely trying to uphold the Law through his own efforts, but he does not fully understand his own actions. He earnestly wished to fulfill the righteous demands of the Law, but he discovered that he could not put into practice what he aspired to do. <br><br>
                  
                  He cherished the spiritual requirements of the Mosaic Law but dislikes every evil way that contradicted it. However, he found himself doing the very sin he hated. At this time, he didn't yet understand the role of the Holy Spirit in enabling a person to fulfill the righteous demands of the Law. <br><br>

                  Perhaps many of us today are wondering and can relate to the experience of Apostle Paul. Because he also went through being young in faith, which is why he can speak of these things based on his own experience.</p> <br>

                <p><b><sup>16</sup> Now if I habitually do what I do not want to do, [that means] I agree with the Law, confessing that it is good (morally excellent).</b> <br><br>
                  
                  He affirms once again that the Law is good, flawless, and divinely ordained. It is holy, just, and good, with enduring requirements. <br><br>
                
                  Perhaps many of us are in a similar situation today. We are blessed by the truths we read and learn from God's words during our devotions, but sometimes, or often, we are still influence by the desires of our flesh. It is true that God's Word is spiritual, while humans are carnal. Even our own willpower is not enough to follow and obey the words we are reading.</p> <br>

                  <p><b><sup>17</sup> So now [if that is the case, then] it is no longer I who do it [the disobedient thing which I despise], but the sin [nature] which lives in me. </b> <br><br>
                  
                    Paul realizes that he is not only sinful but also helpless due to the indwelling sin. The issue lies in the presence of indwelling sin and how to control it. Here, Paul identifies the principle of indwelling sin, which makes it impossible to fulfill the Law. The solution is not the Law or self-effort but there should be the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. <br><br>

                    That's why, we sometimes question ourselves and undergo the same experiences as Apostle Paul. If we still find that the power of sin is stronger than ourselves, it simply indicates that we have not yet fully surrendered to the will of God in our lives. It is still our own self that we are following, and not God. This only shows that we are not yet saved. It is not God who lives in you but it is the old self.</p> <br>

                    <p><b><sup>18</sup> For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh [my human nature, my worldliness—my sinful capacity]. For the willingness [to do good] is present in me, but the doing of good is not.</b> <br><br>
                    
                      Paul discovered that he required greater power coming from God to free him from the power of sin in the present. He needed divine intervention. He had to understand that he was incapable of producing righteousness on his own. Before he could embrace a Savior for the sin within him, he first had to acknowledge his own sinfulness. <br><br>

                      In the journey towards holiness, the first step is to honestly and humbly acknowledge the deep-seated sinfulness within us. Some people fail to live holy lives because they have an overly positive view of themselves. The feeling of self-righteousness. One does not seek deliverance until they recognize the gravity and power of sinfulness in their lives. Faith in the power of the Holy Spirit is attained only through humility before God. An acknowledgement that we are in need of God's power to defeat sin in us.</p> <br>


                      <p><b><sup>19</sup> For the good that I want to do, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. </b> <br><br>
                      
                        In a state of conflict, Paul discovers that although he desires to uphold the Law as a believer, he lacks the power to carry those desires into action. <br><br>

                        Similar to us, we often desire to do good deeds, but more often than not, our actions do not align with our intentions. <br><br>
                      
                        If you are going through these experiences, you are encourage to examine your pitiful fallen state. We need to cry out to the Lord so that we may experience the complete salvation that He is offering us.</p> <br>

                      <p><b><sup>20</sup> But if I am doing the very thing I do not want to do, I am no longer the one doing it [that is, it is not me that acts], but the sin [nature] which lives in me.</b> <br><br>
                      
                        Once again, Paul admits that the inability to fulfill the Law's requirements is not the Law's fault, but his own. He recognizes that the sin nature still resides within him. <br><br>
                      
                        Sin cannot be overcome through the Mosaic Law or by one's own efforts. It is only through the power of the Holy Spirit that we can defeat sin and its temptations.</p> <br>
              
                      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> <br><br>

                        The experiences of Apostle Paul also reflect the experiences of many of us. When we seek to study the Holy Scriptures, many of us do not succeed. There are times when, as soon as we open the Word of God, we feel sleepy. Others, even after reading the Scriptures, do not understand anything. Some, even though they know what is written, do not apply the words they have learned in their lives. This reinforces that our sinful desires of the flesh have no ability to follow the Holy Scriptures because the Law is spiritual while we are of the flesh. <br><br>

                        Here, we also understand that true salvation has not yet been attained by those who refuse to live out God's holiness. Salvation is not yet achieved if you still lack the ability to overcome the power of sin in your life. You also cannot fully comprehend the purpose of what the Lord Jesus Christ did to grant you sufficient power to defeat the evil desires of your nature. This means you continue to engage in habitual sins and actions that violate the will of God.<br> <br>

                        If you claim to have accepted the Lord Jesus into your life but continue to sin and disobey His will, you are only deceiving yourself. The Bible clearly states that all who do not accept the Lord Jesus Christ continue in sin, possess spiritual death, and will ultimately face eternal punishment. The question is, what does it truly mean to accept the salvation offered by God? <br><br>

                        If you approach God with full humility and wholeheartedly follow the direction He has set for you, following the full truth of salvation as taught in the Scriptures, you will surely find true salvation. He will forgive your sins and save you from the power of sin and eternal punishment. Christ is your only hope for complete salvation in this world.</p>
