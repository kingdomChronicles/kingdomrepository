                <h2>Matthew 6:5-8 </h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>

                <p><b>
                  <sup>5</sup>  “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 
                  <sup>6</sup> But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 
                  <sup>7</sup> And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 
                  <sup>8</sup> Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. 
                </b>.</p>

                <p>Request guidance from God through His Holy Spirit to help you carefully follow each step of your devotion.</p>
  
               <ol>
                      
                      <li> Locate a quiet room and close the door to prevent any interruptions while you engage in a meaningful conversation with God through prayer. Remember, even though you cannot see your Father, you can feel His presence because God's presence is already within you.</li>
                      <li> Prepare all the list you've made so that you can offer all to God during your prayer.</li>
                      <li> Through prayer release forgiveness on all the names written on your list. Those who have hurt you. Read each name and forgive them one by one.</li>
                      <li> Through prayer ask God for forgiveness on all the names written on your list. Those whom you hurt. Read each name and ask God to forgive you.</li>
                      <li> Confess and offer to God all your concerns written on your list.</li>
                      <li> Then, envision yourself in a room, nearing God's Holy throne. Leave behind everything that is not pleasing in His sight. As you prepare yourself in your prayer session.</li>
                      <li> Abandon all your great and small accomplishments in life. God is not concerned about them.</li>
                      <li> Release any pride you hold in your physical appearance, as God does not care.</li>
                      <li> Humble down completely as you are completely and spiritualy facing God's Holy throne.</li>
                      <li> Surrender even your intelligence, as God is not concerned about the extent of your knowledge.</li>
                      <li> Reject everything that your physical senses are experiencing—what you see, feel, and hear.</li>
                      <li> Prepare your headphones before you begin to pray. </li>
                      <li> Before clicking on the video link, proceed to the next step.</li>
                      <li> Kneel before the Lord,</li>
                      <li> Visualize and imagine yourself spiritually like this, Hold your heart as if your taking it out from your chest and slowly lift it up to God.</li>
                      <li> Allow your heart to do all the talking. That is the real you.</li>
                      <li> Watch the video and wait for the Holy Spirit to move you in prayer. Confess everything you want to tell to God.</li>
                      <li>Continue until you feel God is finished with you, just let the music video play all through out your prayer session. No. 19 should be done after your prayer session with God.</li>
                      <li> Make a reflection on how God moved during your prayer time.</li>
