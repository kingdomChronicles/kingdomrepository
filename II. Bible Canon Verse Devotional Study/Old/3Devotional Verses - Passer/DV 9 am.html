                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
                <h2>Mark 7:6-9</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
                <p>
                    
                    <sup>6</sup> He replied, “Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: “These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
                    <sup>7</sup>  They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.' 
                    <sup>8</sup>  You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions.” 
                    <sup>9</sup> And he continued, “You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions! 

                </p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>In this verse, Jesus is speaking with these religious leaders, the Pharisees and scribes, who were criticizing Him and his disciples. And he starts talking with them this whole passage in the beginning of Mark, chapter 7, about how they have exalted their traditions, over God's word. The whole issue here is the tendency to minimize God's word and elevate our thoughts and our ways, even when doing religious things. Even in doing things that are supposed to be for God. And that's what's so humbling about this verse: "Isaiah prophecy of you hypocrites." He said, "These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from mine."</p>

                <p>To explain and relate further to the present common practices, the thoughts of this verse relate to our present situation in our religious doings, especially Christian gatherings. We thought this word was only for old religions that put human traditions ahead of God's commandments. That's right, because those religions were really inspired by Satan to mislead people away from the true worship of God.</p>

                <p>But these words are not only in false religions; they are also said even in Christian worship. We think we are safe because we don't do the heinous things that religions do, but what we don't know is that we too have fallen into these words. We say that we worship God, but our worship is also considered a religion because this worship is just a requirement, or just a Sunday obligation.</p>

                <p>As soon as we go to church or Christian fellowship, we feel that we have given ourselves to God, but the truth is that God searches our hearts, He knows if our worship is only through our mouths and not from our hearts. The truth is that our hearts are far away because we still prioritize material things over God. That's why there are those who go to the fellowship who only look at the time because they are thinking about going home.</p>

                <p>We go to fellowship to encourage our fellow believers and be encouraged by them in the things that God is doing in the lives of everyone walking in His direction. The congregation is like a hospital for God to heal the sick and people with wounds in their hearts; those wounds and pain are our spiritual deficiencies. Let's go to meetings to correct our faith through the words of God.</p>

                <p>It hurts to think about it, but we have many rules, even in the church, that are killing God's program. Sometimes it is not God's program that is being followed, but human policies that prevent the Word of God from being shared correctly. Let us follow God's leading, especially His Holy Spirit, and let us not lead God in His program; instead, God should be the one whom we must follow, especially His leading for those who want to approach Him. Through our study of the Word of God, even the beliefs we inherited from our ancestors, even our practices in our congregation, if this is contrary to the Word of God, we should still follow the Word of God and not the inherited teachings. Let's submit to God and His words, that's what we always learn in our daily reading of His words.</p>

                <p>Let us not go just so we can fulfill our Sunday obligation. But let's go to God so that He can teach us to grow in our faith and walk with Him. So that we can follow carefully what He is commanding us to do.</p>

                <p>Let God speak to us every time we go to the congregation to have a meeting. Let's not dictate to God and consider our religious practices and disciplines to be the word of God itself; let's listen to His word to us; let's give our whole selves and personalities so that He can fix them. Anything, even if it is a good religious practice, even with historical values, if it conflicts with the morals of God written in His word, always choose His word.</p>
