                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
                <h2>Galatians 1:6-9</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Livingn Translation)</p>
                <p> 
                    <sup>6</sup> I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called you to himself through the loving mercy of Christ. You are following a different way that pretends to be the Good News 
                    <sup>7</sup> but is not the Good News at all. You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ.
                    <sup>8</sup> Let God's curse fall on anyone, including us or even an angel from heaven, who preaches a different kind of Good News than the one we preached to you. 
                    <sup>9</sup> I say again what we have said before: If anyone preaches any other Good News than the one you welcomed, let that person be cursed
                </p>

                                

                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><b><sup>6</sup> I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called you to himself through the loving mercy of Christ. You are following a different way that pretends to be the Good News</b> <br> <br>
                    Paul began his letter with a brief, beautiful explanation of what the gospel message—the "good news"—about Jesus truly is. Jesus gave His life to pay for human sin before being returned to life by God the Father. Scholars call this "substitutionary atonement," meaning Jesus took our place and paid the full penalty for our sin. Without that, we would be trapped and doomed to death instead of being delivered from "this present evil age." <br> <br>
                    Paul is frustrated with his readers, if not angry. He is, in fact, "astonished" that they are so quickly turning away from the simple truth. More specifically, Paul writes that they are deserting or abandoning Christ Himself by believing a different idea, a different "gospel," than the one he showed them.</p> <br>

                <p><b><sup>7</sup> but is not the Good News at all. You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ.
                </b> <br> <br>
                This is a warning to us that we should not easily believe in teachings, especially if those teachings are contrary to what is written in the word of God. <br><br>
                The verse said that those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ—in our present time, these are the people and religions who twist the truth that was written in the Word of God. Many religious sects, especially those who belong to Christian denominations, were also using the scripture, but they taught the people different interpretations. Some of them were teaching or forbidding their followers to read the scriptures because they taught that they were the only ones authorized to interpret them. We have the Holy Spirit to guide us and teach us the whole truth. This is one of Satan's tactics: to use religions so that people will not see the light of the word of God. That's why our devotional program encourages us to read the word day and night, meaning to continually read and meditate on His words, so that we can easily compare the truth to the twisted teachings of those people who are under the influence of Satan.</p> <br>

                <p><b><sup>8</sup> Let God's curse fall on anyone, including us or even an angel from heaven, who preaches a different kind of Good News than the one we preached to you. 
                </b> <br> <br>
                Paul now curses anyone who would teach a version of the gospel of Jesus other than the one they heard from him. He writes that this includes himself or even an angel from heaven. If "the gospel" is modified, adjusted, or changed by anyone for any reason, it is no longer the gospel. It is not the truth at all. <br> <br>
                In our present age, this would serve as a warning, especially for those who teach the word of God and those who are considered leaders and deacons of a congregation. We must fully understand that we are put in a position to assist people to know the truth and not distort the truth by giving our man-made policies for serving the Lord. All of us must be accountable if we are being used by the enemy to distort the whole truth of the gospel and even teach policies that contradict the truth of the gospel.</p> <br>

                <p><b><sup>9</sup> I say again what we have said before: If anyone preaches any other Good News than the one you welcomed, let that person be cursed</b> <br> <br>
                    This verse repeats Paul's words in the previous verse with even greater emphasis. Repetition in the New Testament is often used to emphasize a point. Here, Paul seems to want to make doubly sure his readers understand exactly how serious this is.<br> <br>
                    Paul, writing under the full weight of his authority as an apostle of Jesus Christ, says once more that anyone who preaches a distorted gospel to them—a message that is different in any way from the one they received from him when he was with them in person—that person stands "accursed." <br> <br>
                    The curse leveled by Paul involves eternal damnation. His implication is that false teachers cannot show you the way to salvation because they do not have it themselves. They are condemned. Paul's letter will clarify exactly why it is so essential not to believe anyone who wants them to believe an altered version of the simple, powerful gospel message of Jesus that Paul has shown to them.</p> <br>

                <p>
                    <b>This is gospel:</b> <br>
                    Receive Christ in order for you to be saved. <br><br>

                    <b>But receiving Christ is not out of our lips only</b> <br> 
                    but on a genuine level of repentance. <br>
                    Because receiving Him requires genuine repentance and a complete turn away from our own selves. <br><br>

                    <b>Is there proof that we have received Christ as our savior?</b> <br>
                    It will result in a transformed life. <br><br>

                    <b>How can God transform our lives?</b> <br>
                    By giving us a new spirit so that we can follow His commandments to us. <br><br>

                    <b>How can we follow His commandments?</b> <br>
                    Read His words and follow everything that is written on them
                </p> <br>

                <p>Without this proof of your salvation, a transformed life, it only concludes that you have received a distorted gospel at all, and what you are believing now as salvation is not salvation at all; you have been believing in a false promise of salvation. If you read the scriptures, anyone who receives Christ has a complete turn around of their life; no one has ever received Him that doesn't result in a change in lives, because if there is no proof of a changed life, then there is no real receiving of Him, and there is no gospel of truth being preached, and this only means that you are not saved at all.</p>
