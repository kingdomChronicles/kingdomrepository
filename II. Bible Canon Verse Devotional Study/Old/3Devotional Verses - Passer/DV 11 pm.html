                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
                <h2>Luke 24:13-25</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
                
                <p>    
                  <sup>13</sup> That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, 
                  <sup>14</sup> and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. 
                  <sup>15</sup> While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. 
                  <sup>16</sup> But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. 
                  <sup>17</sup> And he said to them, “What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?” And they stood still, looking sad. 
                  <sup>18</sup> Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” 
                  <sup>19</sup> And he said to them, “What things?” And they said to him, “Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, 
                  <sup>20</sup> and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 
                  <sup>21</sup> But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. 
                  <sup>22</sup> Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, 
                  <sup>23</sup> and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. 
                  <sup>24</sup> Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.” 
                  <sup>25</sup> And he said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
                </p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><b><sup>13</sup> That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, 
                  <sup>14</sup> and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. </b> <br> 
                
                  In this verse, two of the Lord's disciples are walking to the village of Emmaus from Jerusalem, about eleven kilometers or more. And this time they were sadly talking about the death and burial of the Lord Jesus. </p> <br> <br>


                <p><b><sup>15</sup> While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. 
                  <sup>16</sup> <span style="color: rgb(145, 8, 26);">But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.</span> 
                  <sup>17</sup> And he said to them, “What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?” And they stood still, looking sad. 
                  <sup>18</sup> Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” 
                  <sup>19</sup> And he said to them, “What things?” And they said to him, “Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,  
                  <sup>20</sup> and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 
                  <sup>21</sup> But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. 
                  <sup>22</sup> Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, 
                  <sup>23</sup> and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. 
                  <sup>24</sup> Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.” </b><br> <br>
                
                  Did you know why they did not recognize the Lord, even though He accompanied them on a long journey? They lacked the faith. They were with the Lord when He was still alive and until his death. He also taught his disciples about Him from the beginning of time, as well as who He is in the books of the prophets and of the law.<br><br>
                
                  Did you know that even though God will teach you everything and all the knowledge about salvation and how a person can enter the Kingdom of God, if we are not serious in our search for Him and we still continue our stubbornness, we will not be able to find the true way on how we can enter His kingdom? <br><br>
                
                  From the beginning, we have been taught the importance of what we do in our daily devotions, but many of us still consider it just a worldly requirement. Even God is serious about talking to us and accompanying us through His words, day and night. <br><br>
                  
                  Check your heart's standing before God. He wants us to feel and see Him through His words, but we want to see Him and talk to Him from a distance. We don't want to open our hearts so that He can enter our lives. We are the ones who always refuse. In our minds, we always say we want to come closer to Him, but this desire is only through our mouths and not through our hearts.</p><br> <br>
                  
                <p><b><sup>25</sup> And he said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! </b><br> 
                
                  Because our hearts were hardened. That's why many of us, even while having our daily devotion, don't seem to feel that God is real in our lives. Our doubt is still conquering our faith—that's the reason why we cannot approach Him with our whole being. Many of us still want to cling to worldly things. Try to check our time with our social media, comparing our time to God. We still prioritize worldly things and leave just a portion of our time to God, and during our devotion, we only approach God through our intellect. <br><br>
                
                  The Lord wants to save us all; that's why He came to demonstrate His love to the point of dying for our sins, but we ourselves are the ones who don't want to be saved. Go back to all your devotions. Are you talking to God through your devotion, and are you hearing His words for you? Or is it like you're just taking a test in school, and sometimes you are also cheating on your devotion just to have a written reflection? This is between you and God. What we are doing now through devotion is letting the Holy Spirit speak to us so that we can experience and know how to be truly saved. Let's not foolishly and blindly believe that we have already been saved, but in reality, we are not. <br><br>
                
                  Ask God to give you a humble heart that is ready for His teaching and correction. Get rid of that pride; rather, seek Him with a humble heart. We cannot be saved just by our belief that we are already saved and that we have accepted God into our lives. God sees your heart, and no one can hide it from Him.<br><br>

                  This time, there will be a change in the topics that each one will go through; it does not mean that you will be altogether finished as one in a batch. This is not a seminar or just an activity. What we are doing is spiritual, and we are being taught through our devotion to truly understand the topic of salvation, and this is the most important topic we should know; this will determine our eternity.<br><br>

                  If you continue to believe that you have attained salvation even though your heart is far from God, woe to you! It will be too late before you know that you did not make it to enter His kingdom, and it's too late for you to realize that the door of the kingdom has already closed. You will be among those who will be judged. <br><br>

                  The rest of you will be like the Israelites who wandered around in the wilderness for 40 years because your hearts are hardened and you don't want to be corrected. Let's be humble and ask God to give us a teachable heart. Whatever God wants to teach us in the next few days, let's accept it freely in our hearts and pray to God about the things we still need to surrender so that He will have mercy on us and open our eyes to understand spiritual matters. <br><br>

                  Salvation is for everyone. And you will seek Him if you seek Him with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind, accompanied by a humble and teachable heart. </p>
