                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
                <h2>Romans 6:23</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
                <p>
                  <sup>4</sup> For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
                </p>


                <br><hr>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>
                <p>This verse warns us of the dire fate of those who do not turn from their sin. Maybe people don't know the depth of understanding the word death in this passage. The death referred to here is the eternal punishment of our souls after we die. Maybe our only concern is the current life we have now, so we put this thing aside.</p> 

               <p>What does it mean to turn away from sin? Is that when you accepted the Lord into your life? If we accept Him only through our lips and do not turn away from our old personalities, there is still no change in our old lives. Meaning we will be one of those caught unprepared when He returns.</p>

               <p>So we are encouraged to be obedient to the Words of God that we read, and our devotion will help us to grow and be strengthened in our faith, to have true knowledge, correct service, and adoration for our God.</p>

               <p>If it is said that there is a price for sin, and it is death, how much better is God's gift to us if we truly obey Him?

                We will not experience His gift if we do not accept God's call with all of our hearts and utmost sincerity.</p>

                <p>Just a simple question, how about your performance in your daily devotion program to God, When you started, did you carefully follow what was written in His Word, Did you become so avid to follow even what you read day and night while meditating on His Word. God's call to us is to repent and obey, and the obedience that is said is to obey His Words. Obey everything written on it.</p>

                <p>Spiritual maturity is not measured by the length of time you serve in the church or in a congregation. Some are members of a church or congregation for 5 years or 20 years, but their attitude has not changed at all. God's presence is not reflected in their lives.  Spiritual maturity is based on your obedience to the word of God. If we obey and follow His Word, He will cleanse us, His Word serves as living water that removes the impurity of our personality. And through His Word, we can get closer and closer to God.</p>

                <p>We need to put God first in our lives, let's not be hypocrites that our worship is only up to our lips but not into action if it is said in His Word that it is day and night, we should be in fellowship with God when we wake up in the morning before everything else, and when we go to sleep He is also the last you talk to through prayer and meditation on His Words.</p>

                <p>God has stored, so many mysteries and good things prepared for you, things that will make your life happy and fulfilling, a life in abundance of God's grace and mercy, because life comes from God or rather He is life Himself, and we will experience His immeasurable presence, if our hearts are pure to seek Him and know Him. Let's get to know him for real, and experience it by yourself.</p>

                <p>That is when we labor for God with faith, what we get is indeed more than wages, for we cannot measure it with earthly standards but it is far more beyond us. It will transform our lives and give us the gift of eternal life.</p>
