                <p class="SCQoute" style="font-size: 28px;">Who was Israel to God?</p>

                <h2>Deuteronomy 7:6</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>

                <p><b>
                  <sup>6</sup> For you are a holy people [set apart] to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be a people for His own possession [that is, His very special treasure]. 
                </b></p>
            
                <p>Israel was the nation chosen by God, His treasured possession. Great and mighty acts were displayed to save Israel from bondage under the powerful nation of Egypt. God performed mighty miracles when they conquered the land of Canaan. And countless of miracles was displayed because of God's love towards them.</p>

                <p>Despite God choosing and favoring Israel among the nations of the earth, Israel still rebelled against their God.</p><br>

                <p><b>Read the following verses that describe how the Israelites sinned against God.</b></p>

                <h2>Isaiah 1:2-18</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>

                <p>
                  <sup>2</sup> Hear me, you heavens! Listen, earth! For the Lord has spoken: “I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. <br><br>
                  <sup>3</sup> The ox knows its master, the donkey its owner’s manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.” <br><br>
                  <sup>4</sup> Woe to the sinful nation, a people whose guilt is great, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the Lord; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. <br><br>
                  <sup>5</sup> Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. <br><br>
                  <sup>6</sup> From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness— only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with olive oil. <br><br>
                  <sup>7</sup> Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. <br><br>
                  <sup>8</sup> Daughter Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a city under siege. <br><br>
                  <sup>9</sup> Unless the Lord Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. <br><br>
                  <sup>10</sup> Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the instruction of our God, you people of Gomorrah! <br><br>
                  <sup>11</sup> “The multitude of your sacrifices— what are they to me?” says the Lord. “I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. <br><br>
                  <sup>12</sup> When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? <br><br>
                  <sup>13</sup> Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations— I cannot bear your worthless assemblies. <br><br>
                  <sup>14</sup> Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals I hate with all my being. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. <br><br>
                  <sup>15</sup> When you spread out your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you; even when you offer many prayers, I am not listening. Your hands are full of blood! <br><br>
                  <sup>16</sup> Wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight; stop doing wrong. <br><br>
                  <sup>17</sup> Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow. <br><br>
                  <sup>18</sup> “Come now, let us settle the matter,” says the Lord. “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.
                </p> <br><br>

                <p><b><sup>2</sup> Hear me, you heavens! Listen, earth! For the Lord has spoken: “I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.</b> <br><br>
                  In this opening verse, the universe is called to witness a trial with God as the Judge, and Judah and Jerusalem as the defendants. The accusation is against the people of Israel, who are described as rebellious sons against God.
                </p>

                <p>Witness the transgressions of the nation from verses 4 to 15. Do you also observe these transgressions of your nation?</p>

                <p>And we have witnessed what happened to the nation of Israel. The entire nation was chastised because of their rebellion. God scattered them among the nations of the world. <br><br>

                  Are we asking ourselves why our nation is also poor, plagued with corruption and injustices? <br><br>
                  
                  In reality, do you envision a bright future for this country?<br><br>
                  
                  List the sins of your country has committed against God.<br><br>
                
                  Have you prayed for your country?<br><br>
                  
                  Ask God to prepare your heart so that this evening, He will teach you how to truly intercede for the nation.<br><br>
                  
                  Offer your prayer now as you conclude your morning devotion.</p>
