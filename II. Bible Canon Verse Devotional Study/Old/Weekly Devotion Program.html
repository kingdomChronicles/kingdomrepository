            <p>
            <sup>11</sup> To illustrate the point further, Jesus told them this story: “A man had two sons. 
            <sup>12</sup> The younger son told his father, ‘I want my share of your estate now before you die.’ So his father agreed to divide his wealth between his sons. 
            <sup>13</sup> “A few days later this younger son packed all his belongings and moved to a distant land, and there he wasted all his money in wild living. 
            <sup>14</sup> About the time his money ran out, a great famine swept over the land, and he began to starve. 
            <sup>15</sup> He persuaded a local farmer to hire him, and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs. 
            <sup>16</sup> The young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him. But no one gave him anything. 
            <sup>17</sup> “When he finally came to his senses, he said to himself, ‘At home even the hired servants have food enough to spare, and here I am dying of hunger! 
            <sup>18</sup> I will go home to my father and say, “Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, 
            <sup>19</sup> and I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired servant.”’ 
            <sup>20</sup> “So he returned home to his father. And while he was still a long way off, his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion, he ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him. 
            <sup>21</sup> His son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, and I am no longer worthy of being called your son.’ 
            <sup>22</sup> “But his father said to the servants, ‘Quick! Bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him. Get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet. 
            <sup>23</sup> And kill the calf we have been fattening. We must celebrate with a feast, 
            <sup>24</sup> for this son of mine was dead and has now returned to life. He was lost, but now he is found.’ So the party began.

            <p>
                <sup>14</sup> After Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it, he went up to the Lord’s Temple and spread it out before the Lord. 
                <sup>15</sup> And Hezekiah prayed this prayer before the Lord: “O Lord, God of Israel, you are enthroned between the mighty cherubim! You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You alone created the heavens and the earth. 
                <sup>16</sup> Bend down, O Lord, and listen! Open your eyes, O Lord, and see! Listen to Sennacherib’s words of defiance against the living God. 
                <sup>17</sup> “It is true, Lord, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all these nations. 
                <sup>18</sup> And they have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire and burned them. But of course the Assyrians could destroy them! They were not gods at all—only idols of wood and stone shaped by human hands. 
                <sup>19</sup> Now, O Lord our God, rescue us from his power; then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you alone, O Lord, are God.”

            <p>
                <sup>8</sup> Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel. After conferring with his officers, he said, “I will set up my camp in such and such a place.” 
                <sup>9</sup> The man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there.” 
                <sup>10</sup> So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places. 
                <sup>11</sup> This enraged the king of Aram. He summoned his officers and demanded of them, “Tell me! Which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?” 
                <sup>12</sup> “None of us, my lord the king,” said one of his officers, “but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.” 
                <sup>13</sup> “Go, find out where he is,” the king ordered, “so I can send men and capture him.” The report came back: “He is in Dothan.” 
                <sup>14</sup> Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there. They went by night and surrounded the city. 
                <sup>15</sup> When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. “Oh no, my lord! What shall we do?” the servant asked. 
                <sup>16</sup> “Don’t be afraid,” the prophet answered. “Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”
