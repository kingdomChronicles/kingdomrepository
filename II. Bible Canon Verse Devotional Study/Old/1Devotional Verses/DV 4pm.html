                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
                <h2>Isaiah 64:6</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">Amp (Amplified Bible)</p>
                <p><sup>6</sup> For we all have become like one who is [ceremonially] unclean [like a leper], And all our deeds of righteousness are like filthy rags; We all wither and decay like a leaf, And our wickedness [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing], like the wind, takes us away [carrying us far from God's favor, toward destruction].</p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>Just like what Isaiah when God inspires him to warn the Israelites in his time, we are also reminded by God today that all our "righteousness" is like filthy rags," <br>

                    Our sinful attitudes pollute even our good deeds. The impurity of our motives taints all our prayers, sacrifices, offerings, and praises. We cannot praise God during our worship fellowship alone. We cannot approach God in worship if our deeds and motives are full of impurities in our daily lives.</p> 

                <p>But we are all an unclean thing; rather, we are all become one who is unclean in front of God, even if we feel we are worshiping God in worship fellowship, it is hypocrisy in front of our Divine, Holy, and Mighty God that you feel you are worshiping Him, but in reality, you are just mocking Him because your worship is only on an outward appearance, but your heart is full of filthiness. </p>  
                
                <p>Even in the best deeds of the best person in the world, there is some taint of evil. We all do fade like a leaf.  Our iniquities... have taken us away; or, carried us away; we are taken far away from God, carried us into a region where God is not, or where, at any rate, "his presence is not felt".</p>

                <p>We are all an unclean thing - Or, unclean person, as equally signifies. People seem to allude to people being unclean through leprosy, which was the highest degree of uncleanness among the Jews. A moral leprosy is upon us. We are like the leprous man, who has to rend his clothes and go about crying "Unclean: unclean!" that those who hear may get out of his way. He means that the body of the people was like one under a ceremonial pollution, who was not admitted into the courts of the Tabernacle; or like one laboring under some loathsome disease. </p>

                <p>We are all, by sin, not only abominable to God's justice but offensive to his holiness. The prophets frequently borrow their images from the received customs and spiritual ceremonies of the nations, among which the distinction between things clean and unclean makes no small figure, and under these images, they frequently describe moral defects and religious offenses.</p>

                <p>All our righteousness is considered as a menstruous garment. And all our righteousness, or justifications, are as filthy rags - as rags which cannot cover us; as filthy rags which would only defile us. Concerning the Jews, Prophet Isaiah refers to all those external ceremonies and services wherein they placed merit, and whereby they hoped for justification. Nowadays, we also consider ourselves as serving God by doing some ministerial work in the congregation, but our daily lives are not accepted in the eyes of our Holy God.</p>

                <p>Our God wants to see our heart, not our outside actions and activities; worse, we have a lot of activities and doings without considering the thoughts of our God. At the same time, like the Israelites, they neglected moral duties and were guilty even of very gross violations of God's holy law. Prophet Micah, who lived at the same time, speaks in the same manner too. But the prophet's declaration is true if considered as comprehending the best works and actions that can be performed by any human; for all our works have so great an alloy of imperfection, that they cannot justify us before a holy and just God.</p>

                <p>And our iniquities, like the wind - A wind that withers both leaves and fruit, or that sweeps away all before it; have taken us away -  Like the Israelites they were taken Out of their land, and from all privileges and blessings, and scattered abroad through all the earth; or from God's favor, into a state of condemnation and wrath. Like the Israelites, we are all experiencing miseries in our own lives because we are living outside God's approved living. Our iniquities serve as an approval for the enemy to attack our lives and destroy us.</p>

                <p>That is why we are encouraged to continually search and study the Word of God, to be guided and warned continually that serving the Most High God is not what many of us think. We must serve God the highest and best, not by mediocrity. We must serve Him with our whole being, all our actions, thoughts, and everything in us all the time. God should be first in everything. Amen.</p>
