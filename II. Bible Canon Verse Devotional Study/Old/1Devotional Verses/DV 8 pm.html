                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
                <h2>Acts 5:27-29</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">Amp (Amplified Version)</p>
                <p>
                    
                    <sup>27</sup> So they brought them and presented them before the Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court). The high priest questioned them, 
                    <sup>28</sup> saying, “We gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name, and yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you intend to bring this Man's blood on us [by accusing us as His murderers].” <br>
                    <sup>29</sup> Then Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than men [we have no other choice].
                </p>

                                

                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>It is true that we can see scriptures commanding us to submit to earthly governments, but this is not always the same as obeying the government at all. Apostle Peter and the other apostles live out this example. When government laws are in conflict with the law of God and the words of Jesus, believers are instructed to follow the higher order, which is the commandment of God. And in obeying God, we must be ready for the consequences of our choices. Like what the apostles displayed here, even though they know that if they disobey the instructions of the Sanhedrin, which are the Jewish High Court officials, they still prefer to follow what God is commanding them to do.</p>

                <p>In this verse, we witness the real servants or followers of God, we must display our highest allegiance to God and not to human authorities. Whoever it is that is commanding you, if it will conflict with the words of God to you, then choose God. You have his words; mirror everything you are seeing, hearing, feeling, and even thinking. If these will disobey God's personal instructions to you, then always obey God above all else.</p>      
                
                <p>The apostles stand before the Sanhedrin, explaining why they broke a direct command to stop preaching about Jesus. When the Sanhedrin first gave the order, Peter and John responded, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge." Peter and John stood before the priests, elders, and scribes of the Mosaic law and told them the restriction was contrary to what God wanted. So even though they were forbidden to teach in the name of Jesus, they continued to do so even though they knew that they could die because of their obedience to God.</p>

                <p>Jesus prepared his disciples well for this moment. Several times, during altercations with the Pharisees, He taught them to follow God's commandments rather than man's tradition. He told them, "Do not fear those who kill the body, and after that, have nothing more that they can do...fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell." He told them the world would hate and persecute them because they followed Him. In fact, he told them men would drag them before synagogues and courts and flog them, which is exactly what happen. But the apostles are to "bear witness before them and the Gentiles.".</p>

                <p>Again, the apostles assert that the Jewish ruling council neither serves nor speaks for God. They insist that the council's archenemy, a traveling teacher from Nazareth, has overcome their assassination and risen from the dead. It's sad the council members can't deeply consider the apostles' words, especially as those claims align with the law and the prophets they claim to know so well. But they're more afraid of losing earthly power than interested in finding God's forgiveness.</p>

                <p>Brothers and sisters in Christ, we are commanded to follow God above all else. One friend says that these should be the priority levels that we could follow as our guide in all our decisions. First it should be God, then second is ourselves, third are our family members, whether it is your spouse, children, siblings, or parents, fourth are our friends, and last are other people. If your friends are in conflict with other people we don't know, it is normal to side with our friends. Then, if our friends are in conflict with our family, we normally choose our family. That's why there is a saying that blood is thicker than water. If God's command is in conflict with our family, then choose God. If God is in conflict with our body's desire, we are commanded to choose God. And for you to be acceptable to God, choose Him above others, because all others are temporary, but God is eternal. And our choices here on earth will determine where we will spend the rest of our eternity.</p>
