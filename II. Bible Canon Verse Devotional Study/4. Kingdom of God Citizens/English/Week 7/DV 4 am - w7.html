        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Wisdom and Foolishness in the Light of Eternity</b></p>

        <p> "The wise will inherit honor, but fools increase dishonor". This verse captures a profound truth about the consequences of wisdom and foolishness, not only in earthly life but also in eternity. It draws a clear line between those who live according to godly knowledge and those who reject it, emphasizing that wisdom leads to honor, while foolishness results in shame and disgrace. <br><br>

        In the biblical context, wisdom is not merely intellectual capability or the accumulation of knowledge. It is the ability to act in accordance with godly principles, to fear the Lord, and to walk in His ways. On the other hand, foolishness is not ignorance or lack of intelligence. Rather, it refers to a willful rejection of spiritual truth, stubbornness, arrogance, and the refusal to acknowledge God’s sovereignty. Fools mock godly wisdom, closing their hearts to the eternal perspective that God offers. <br><br>
        
        Throughout Scripture, the consequences of wisdom and foolishness are evident. Proverbs 3:31 warns against envy of the wicked, and in the Psalm of Asaph, <br><br>

        <i><b>Psalms 73:1-15 NKJV</b><br>
        <sup>1</sup> Truly God is good to Israel, To such as are pure in heart. <sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; My steps had nearly slipped. <sup>3</sup> For I was envious of the boastful, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked. <sup>4</sup> For there are no pangs in their death, But their strength is firm. <sup>5</sup> They are not in trouble as other men, Nor are they plagued like other men. <sup>6</sup> Therefore pride serves as their necklace; Violence covers them like a garment. <sup>7</sup> Their eyes bulge with abundance; They have more than heart could wish. <sup>8</sup> They scoff and speak wickedly concerning oppression; They speak loftily. <sup>9</sup> They set their mouth against the heavens, And their tongue walks through the earth. <sup>10</sup> Therefore his people return here, And waters of a full cup are drained by them. <sup>11</sup> And they say, “How does God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?” <sup>12</sup> Behold, these are the ungodly, Who are always at ease; They increase in riches. <sup>13</sup> Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain, And washed my hands in innocence. <sup>14</sup> For all day long I have been plagued, And chastened every morning. <sup>15</sup> If I had said, “I will speak thus,” Behold, I would have been untrue to the generation of Your children.</i><br><br>

        
        <i><b>Psalms 73:16-20 NKJV</b><br>
        <sup>16</sup> When I thought how to understand this, It was too painful for me— <sup>17</sup> Until I went into the sanctuary of God; Then I understood their end. <sup>18</sup> Surely You set them in slippery places; You cast them down to destruction. <sup>19</sup> Oh, how they are brought to desolation, as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors. <sup>20</sup> As a dream when one awakes, So, Lord, when You awake, You shall despise their image.</i><br><br>

        <i><b>Psalms 73:21-27 NKJV</b><br>
        <sup>21</sup> Thus my heart was grieved, And I was vexed in my mind. <sup>22</sup> I was so foolish and ignorant; I was like a beast before You. <sup>23</sup> Nevertheless I am continually with You; You hold me by my right hand. <sup>24</sup> You will guide me with Your counsel, And afterward receive me to glory. <sup>25</sup> Whom have I in heaven but You? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides You. <sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart fail; But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. <sup>27</sup> For indeed, those who are far from You shall perish; You have destroyed all those who desert You for harlotry.</i><br><br>

        <i><b>Psalms 73:28 NKJV</b><br>
        But it is good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the Lord God, That I may declare all Your works.</i><br><br>

        - the Psalm of Asaph highlights the ultimate destruction of those who reject God. And it gave him the realization that there is no use in envying the foolish because foolishness leads to dishonor in life and eternal destruction. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Philippians 3:18-19 NKJV</b><br>
        <sup>18</sup> For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: <sup>19</sup> whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame—who set their mind on earthly things. </i><br><br>
        
        This identifies such people as "enemies of the cross of Christ," whose destiny is destruction. A striking example of this is the parable of the rich fool in Luke. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Luke 12:16-21 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>16</sup> Then he told them a story: “A rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops. <sup>17</sup> He said to himself, ‘What should I do? I don’t have room for all my crops.’ <sup>18</sup> Then he said, ‘I know! I’ll tear down my barns and build bigger ones. Then I’ll have room enough to store all my wheat and other goods. <sup>19</sup> And I’ll sit back and say to myself, “My friend, you have enough stored away for years to come. Now take it easy! Eat, drink, and be merry!”’ <sup>20</sup>  “But God said to him, ‘You fool! You will die this very night. Then who will get everything you worked for?’ <sup>21</sup>  “Yes, a person is a fool to store up earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with God.” </i> <br><br>
        
        The man trusted in his wealth and boasted in his material abundance, but God declared him a fool for failing to consider the eternal state of his soul. That very night, his life was taken, and all his possessions became meaningless. <br><br>
        
        In contrast, the wise inherit honor by trusting in God and living according to His will. Honor may not always be fully realized in this life, as believers often face trials and opposition, but it is guaranteed in eternity. The apostle Paul serves as a prime example of wisdom in action. Despite suffering for the sake of the gospel, Paul remained faithful and looked forward to the crown of righteousness that the Lord would award him. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Timothy 4:8 NLT</b><br>
        And now the prize awaits me—the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me on the day of his return. And the prize is not just for me but for all who eagerly look forward to his appearing. </i> <br><br>
        
        He assured that this reward was not limited to him but extended to all who longed for Christ’s return. <br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 3:35 reminds us of the stark difference between wisdom and foolishness. Fools pursue fleeting pleasures, trusting in worldly success or material wealth, only to find themselves empty-handed before God. The wise, however, invest in what is eternal—trusting in God, living for His glory, and walking in His ways. They may lose much in this world, but they gain eternal honor and reward. <br><br>
        
        In the end, wisdom and foolishness are choices that define our eternal destiny. To walk in wisdom is to align ourselves with God’s truth and to embrace the life He offers. To walk in foolishness is to reject His truth, leading to dishonor and destruction. Let us choose the path of wisdom, so that we may inherit honor both now and in eternity.
