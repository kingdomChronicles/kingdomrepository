        <h2>Proverbs 4:3</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>

        

        <p><sup>3</sup> For I, too, was once my father’s son, tenderly loved as my mother’s only child.</p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Importance of Parental Influence</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 4:3 (NLT) states, “For I, too, was once my father’s son, tenderly loved as my mother’s only child.” This verse reflects Solomon’s personal recollection of his upbringing, suggesting a time when he experienced one-on-one attention and deep affection from his parents. As the son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was raised in a unique environment that contributed to his growth in wisdom. Though later accounts in Scripture mention his three brothers—Shimea, Shobab, and Nathan (1 Chronicles 3:5)—the emphasis Solomon places on being “tenderly loved” suggests he experienced a special bond with his parents during his formative years. <br><br>

        While the Bible does not always record children in strict chronological order, Solomon’s position as the final name among Bathsheba’s sons could imply significance rather than timing. More importantly, the verse underscores the value of intentional time spent between parents and their children. Whether Solomon was truly an “only child” for a period or simply cherished as though he were, it is evident that David and Bathsheba made the effort to nurture and teach him in ways that helped form his wisdom and character. <br><br>
        
        This verse serves as a reminder of the critical role parents play in shaping their children’s spiritual and moral foundations. Parents who invest quality time and effort in their children’s upbringing create an environment conducive to learning, growth, and wisdom. Such attention does not merely focus on practical skills or academics but also on spiritual development—teaching them the fear of the Lord, the foundation of wisdom. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 9:10 ESV</b><br>
        The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.</i> <br><br>
        
        In a world full of distractions, the danger for modern families lies in becoming too busy to prioritize the spiritual training of their children. <br><br>
        
        The example of Solomon’s upbringing connects to the life of Jesus Christ as well. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Luke 2:52 ESV</b><br>
        And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.</i><br><br>
        
        Luke reveals that Jesus “increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man,” a clear indication that Joseph and Mary played an active role in nurturing Him during His youth. Their intentional care and guidance contributed to Jesus’ holistic development, demonstrating that parents who invest spiritually in their children help lay a foundation for their future success. <br><br>
        
        As Solomon fondly recalls the love and training he received as a child, he highlights the lasting impact of a parent's influence. Parents who diligently teach their children in the ways of the Lord will not only see the fruit of their labor in their children’s lives but will also be remembered with gratitude. This principle echoes throughout Scripture: children who are raised in wisdom and godliness carry forward the legacy of faith and understanding into future generations.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 22:6 KJV</b><br>
        Train up a child in the way he should go: And when he is old, he will not depart from it.</i> <br><br>
        
        In conclusion, Proverbs 4:3 provides a powerful reminder of the responsibility and privilege parents have in guiding their children. Whether through personal attention, spiritual instruction, or tender love, such efforts are never wasted. Solomon’s wisdom and Jesus’ growth serve as examples of what can be achieved when parents prioritize their children’s spiritual and moral development. Today’s parents are encouraged to pause, reflect, and commit to investing in their children, ensuring they, too, are prepared for lives of purpose, wisdom, and favor before God and others.
