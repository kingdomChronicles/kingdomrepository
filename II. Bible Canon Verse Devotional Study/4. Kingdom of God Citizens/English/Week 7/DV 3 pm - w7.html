        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 3:34</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>

        

        <p><sup>34</sup> He mocks proud mockersbut shows favor to the humble and oppressed.</p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Humility that God Favors</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 3:34 states, "He mocks proud mockers but shows favor to the humble and oppressed." This verse captures a timeless truth about the nature of God and His dealings with humanity. It contrasts two attitudes: the arrogance of those who mock others and the humility of those who acknowledge their dependence on God. This profound statement encourages self-reflection and challenges us to adopt an attitude of humility, which invites God’s grace into our lives. <br><br>

        The Hebrew roots of the words "mock" and "scoff" give deeper insight into the behavior that displeases God. The verb yā'lis' and the noun lē'sim describe individuals who are not only proud but also derisive, sneering at others in arrogance. Such people elevate themselves above others, forgetting their own frailty before the supreme God. In the face of God’s holiness and omnipotence, such arrogance is ultimately futile. As Proverbs reminds us,<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 16:18 NKJV</b><br>
        Pride goes before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall.</i><br><br>
        
        In stark contrast, humility is a characteristic that God honors. Those who admit their own weaknesses and rely on God’s grace find favor in His sight. This concept is echoed throughout Scripture, including in the New Testament. James reminds us, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>James 4:6 NLT</b><br>
        And he gives grace generously. As the Scriptures say, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”</i><br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 Peter 5:5 ESV</b><br>
        Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”</i><br><br>
        
        - similarly urges believers to clothe themselves with humility. These teachings reinforce the idea that God’s grace is extended to those who forsake pride and embrace humility.<br><br>
        
        Jesus' parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector vividly illustrates the stark difference between pride and humility. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Lucas 18:9-14 MBBTAG12</b><br>
        <sup>9</sup> Sinabi rin niya ang talinghagang ito sa mga taong matuwid ang tingin sa sarili at hinahamak naman ang iba. <sup>10</sup> “May dalawang lalaking pumasok sa Templo upang manalangin, ang isa ay Pariseo at ang isa ay maniningil ng buwis. <sup>11</sup> Tumayo ang Pariseo at nanalangin nang ganito: ‘O Diyos, nagpapasalamat ako sa iyo sapagkat hindi ako katulad ng iba na mga magnanakaw, mandaraya, mangangalunya, o kaya'y katulad ng maniningil ng buwis na ito. <sup>12</sup> Dalawang beses akong nag-aayuno sa isang linggo at nagbibigay rin ako ng ikasampung bahagi mula sa lahat ng aking kinikita.’ <sup>13</sup> Samantala, ang maniningil ng buwis nama'y nakatayo sa malayo at di man lamang makatingin sa langit. Dinadagukan niya ang kanyang dibdib at sinasabi, ‘O Diyos, mahabag po kayo sa akin na isang makasalanan!’ <sup>14</sup> Sinasabi ko sa inyo, ang lalaking ito'y umuwing matuwid sa harapan ng Diyos, at hindi ang Pariseo. Sapagkat ang sinumang nagmamataas ay ibababa at ang nagpapakababa ay itataas.”  </i><br><br>
        
        In this story, the Pharisee exemplifies the self-righteous individual who relies on his own deeds and compares himself favorably to others. He prays arrogantly, boasting about his fasting and tithing, and despises the tax collector. In contrast, the tax collector approaches God with a broken spirit, standing far off, bowing his head, and humbly praying, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner". Jesus concludes that the tax collector, not the Pharisee, went home justified, teaching that "everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted".<br><br>
        
        This parable serves as a warning to those who, even in religious contexts, rely on their own righteousness rather than on God’s grace. It also encourages believers to seek God with a contrite heart, recognizing their sinfulness and need for His mercy. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Hebrews 4:15-16 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>15</sup> For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. <sup>16</sup> Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</i><br><br>
        
        As Hebrews reminds us, we have a High Priest who understands our weaknesses and invites us to approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, where we can find mercy in our time of need.<br><br>
        
        In practical terms, Proverbs 3:34 challenges us to examine our own attitudes. Do we, like the Pharisee, elevate ourselves by looking down on others, or do we humbly acknowledge our dependence on God? The verse reminds us that true greatness in God’s kingdom comes through humility. By rejecting pride and seeking God with a sincere and humble heart, we position ourselves to receive His favor, mercy, and grace.<br><br>
        
        In conclusion, Proverbs 3:34 calls us to a life of humility before God. The proud, who mock others and elevate themselves, are ultimately brought low. But those who humbly seek God’s grace find favor in His sight. This teaching serves as a cornerstone for Christian living, reminding us that humility is the key to experiencing God’s mercy and to walking in His ways. It is a timeless reminder that the path to exaltation in God’s kingdom begins with the humble admission of our need for Him.
