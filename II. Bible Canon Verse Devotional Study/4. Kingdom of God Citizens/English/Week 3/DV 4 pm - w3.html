        <h2>Proverbs 2:12</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>

        

        <p><sup>12</sup> Wisdom will save you from evil people, from those whose words are twisted.</p>

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Connection Between Wisdom, Knowledge, and Joy</b></p> -->

        <p> This verse highlights the protective power of wisdom against harmful influences, specifically those who use deceptive or perverse language. By aligning oneself with wisdom, one is safeguarded from individuals who twist the truth for their own benefit, leading others astray. <br><br>

        In the preceding verse, Proverbs 2:11, discretion and understanding are emphasized as essential virtues that guard a person’s mind and actions. Discretion, in this context, refers to the ability to exercise good judgment and control over one’s thoughts, avoiding impulsive or reckless behavior. Understanding, on the other hand, is the deep comprehension of wisdom that enables a person to make sound decisions. Together, these virtues serve as a shield against danger and folly, ensuring that one stays on a righteous path. <br><br>
        
        Proverbs 2:12 builds on this concept, indicating that these virtues—discretion and understanding—offer protection from evil people, especially those who use “twisted” words. The Hebrew word for “twisted” in this context is <i>tahpukot</i>, which refers to speech that is intentionally rebellious, obstinate, or offensive. These are not just innocent mistakes but calculated attempts to manipulate or deceive others. People who use such speech distort the truth and spread lies, creating confusion and leading others into moral or spiritual danger. <br><br>
        
        The importance of being delivered from such people cannot be overstated. Those who manipulate truth often lead others into destructive paths, either by encouraging immoral behavior or by sowing discord and division. Wisdom acts as a safeguard by helping a person recognize and avoid these dangerous influences. With wisdom, one can discern the intentions behind deceptive speech and steer clear of those who would cause harm. <br><br>
        
        Moreover, this verse reflects a broader theme in Proverbs: the idea that living righteously, according to wisdom, brings about protection and blessing. Just as justice ensures that each person receives what they are due, wisdom ensures that those who pursue it are rewarded with safety and deliverance. Those who live with discernment and understanding can navigate through life’s challenges without falling victim to the schemes of evil people.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 2:12 reminds us that wisdom is not just about knowledge but about safeguarding our lives from harm. It offers a way to recognize and avoid those who would lead us astray, protecting both our minds and our souls from the dangers of twisted, perverse speech. Through wisdom, we gain the ability to see through deception and maintain a course of righteousness, free from the harmful influence of evil.
