        <h2>Proverbs 2:6</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>

        

        <p><sup>6</sup> For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;</p>

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Series Lesson: The Consequence of Neglecting Wisdom</b></p> -->

        <p> Proverbs 2:6 declares, "For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding." This verse holds a powerful reminder about the source of true wisdom, emphasizing that all understanding and knowledge flow directly from God Himself. It underscores that while we may seek knowledge in many places, the only true and enduring wisdom comes from the Lord. Solomon, in the preceding verses of Proverbs 2, exhorts his readers to pursue wisdom like one pursues hidden treasure, with eagerness and persistence. In doing so, he reminds us that wisdom, understanding, and knowledge are divine gifts that cannot be found outside of God’s provision. <br><br>

        The placement of this verse is significant because it concludes the thought begun in Proverbs 2:1-5, where the fear of the Lord is established as a foundational principle for obtaining wisdom. Solomon’s instruction makes it clear that those who truly seek wisdom must approach God with reverence, recognizing His authority as the ultimate source of insight. Thus, if we desire wisdom, it must be sought from the Lord Himself, in humility and in faith. <br><br>
        
        Interestingly, there is an implicit virtue that undergirds the pursuit of divine wisdom: courage. The Bible repeatedly connects the act of seeking God’s wisdom with a command to persevere and be courageous. This is because asking for wisdom from the Lord requires boldness—boldness to trust in His guidance and to act upon His truth, even when it challenges worldly norms or personal preferences.  <br><br>
        
        <i>Hebrews 4:16 ESV <br> Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</i> <br><br>
        
        
        The verse invites us to approach God’s throne with confidence, knowing that He understands our weaknesses and is ready to provide grace and wisdom when we ask. Similarly, <br><br>
        
        <i>James 1:5 ESV <br> If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. </i><br><br>
        
        
        James 1:5 encourages us to ask for wisdom without doubting, showing that courage and trust in God's provision are inseparable. Courage is also seen in the example of Abraham, who persevered in faith despite the obstacles he faced. <br><br>
        
        <i>Hebrews 6:15 KJV <br> And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</i> <br><br>

        
        His story illustrates that true courage, like wisdom, originates from a deep reliance on God. It is not merely a human attribute but a divine gift that enables believers to act boldly in obedience to God’s commands.<br><br>
        
        While God Himself does not possess courage in the human sense—since nothing can threaten or oppose Him—He is the perfect embodiment of boldness. As A.W. Tozer points out, God’s attributes are not qualities He possesses but the very essence of who He is. God acts with confidence and authority, unshaken by any force, and in turn, His courage inspires believers to trust in His wisdom and walk fearlessly in His ways.<br><br>
        
        In conclusion, Proverbs 2:6 not only points us to God as the ultimate source of wisdom but also invites us to courageously seek and apply that wisdom in our lives. To receive understanding from the Lord requires boldness, not just to ask but also to live out the knowledge and insight He gives. True courage, just like true wisdom, is a divine gift, and both are necessary for living a life that honors God and reflects His will.
