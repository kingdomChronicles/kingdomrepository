  <h2>Proverbs 1:10-14</h2>
  <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>

  <p>
    <sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. 
    <sup>11</sup> If they say, “Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason; 
    <sup>12</sup> like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole, like those who go down to the pit; 
    <sup>13</sup> we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder; 
    <sup>14</sup> throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse”—

  <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Beware of Evil Companions series: A Fatherly Warning from Proverbs 1:10-19</b></p>

  <p>In the book of Proverbs, wisdom is portrayed as a precious treasure, essential for making decisions that lead to life and righteousness. Early in this text, we are introduced to two key pillars of wisdom: the fear of the Lord, which compels us to heed His Word, and respect for our parents, which ensures we listen to their guidance. These two principles are foundational in navigating life’s many challenges, including one that demands significant discernment—our choice of friends. <br><br>

  The people we spend time with, particularly our peers, often play a profound role in shaping our thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors. This influence can be either positive or negative, which raises an important question: Can friends be a source of good counsel and wisdom? While the answer is certainly yes, the Bible also warns that the wrong kind of friends can lead us astray. This theme is central in Proverbs 1:10-19, where a fatherly warning is issued against associating with evil companions. <br><br>
  
  <b>Fatherly Warning Concerning Evil Companions</b> <br><br>
  
  The father’s counsel begins with a clear and straightforward admonition: “If sinners entice you, do not consent.” (Proverbs 1:10). This advice is a direct call to be cautious and mindful of the influences around us, particularly when peers encourage us to engage in wrongful behavior. The father recognizes that the pull of such companions can be powerful, especially when they seek to entice us into committing evil deeds. <br><br>
  
  In Proverbs 1:11-12, the father warns of companions who may tempt us to engage in acts of violence, such as murder and robbery. They may promise quick and easy rewards, making such sinful actions appear profitable and desirable. These friends appeal to human greed, suggesting that one can gain wealth without hard work, and that moral consequences can be avoided.  <br><br>
  
  This is why Proverbs 1:13-14 speaks of promises of easy gain, which are often tied to dishonorable actions like theft or violence. The allure of easy rewards is one of the primary methods used by evil companions to lure people into sin. <br><br>
  
  In light of the fatherly warning in Proverbs, it is clear that no matter how appealing the offer may seem, we must not yield to temptation. While the passage uses the extreme examples of murder and robbery, the underlying principle applies to all forms of sinful behavior. <b>We must remain alert and discerning, recognizing that what appears attractive at first may ultimately lead to spiritual and moral ruin.</b> <br><br>

  Thus, the lesson from Proverbs is a timeless call to choose our companions wisely. Even if we are not faced with the violent scenarios described, we must be cautious about the company we keep, especially those who disregard God’s commandments. Associating with such individuals can gradually undermine our own faith and convictions. The temptation of easy rewards may be enticing, but they often lead down a path of destruction. Instead, we are encouraged to pursue righteousness, seek wisdom, and surround ourselves with people who respect and honor God. <br><br>
  
  <i>True wisdom lies in our ability to distinguish right from wrong, standing firm in our faith, and avoiding the influence of those who would lead us away from the path of righteousness.</i>
