        <h1>Daily Devotional Verses</h1>
    </center>


    <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

    <h2>Proverbs 1:22</h2>
    <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>

    <p>
      <sup>22</sup> "How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffingand fools hate knowledge?

    <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Danger of Evil Companions</b></p> -->

    <p>In Proverbs 1:21, wisdom is portrayed as a woman calling out in crowded places, symbolizing the accessibility of wisdom to all people. The imagery of a woman crying in a busy marketplace suggests that wisdom is not hidden or exclusive; it is openly available to everyone. The marketplace is a place where people gather for everyday activities, so the depiction emphasizes that the opportunity to gain wisdom is present in the midst of daily life. Yet, the response to wisdom is divided—people either accept it or choose to ignore it.<br><br>

    While verse 23 speaks to those who do respond to wisdom’s call, the majority of the passage addresses those who refuse to listen. Verse 22 explicitly states that ignoring wisdom is not accidental, but a deliberate act. <b><i>People choose to reject wisdom because they prefer their own desires, no matter how foolish or self-serving they may be. This rejection is not due to ignorance alone; rather, it is a willful decision to remain in ignorance, clinging to a simpler way of life instead of seeking wisdom.</i></b><br><br>
    
    The passage suggests that the issue is not an inability to understand but a refusal to engage with wisdom. <b><i>There is a common saying, "There is no such thing as invincible ignorance," which means that anyone can overcome a lack of knowledge if they are willing to learn. The problem lies not in the capacity to know, but in the desire to know.</i></b> This principle can be observed in how many people in today's world react to morality, tragedy, and conflict. Instead of seeking wise solutions, <b><i>they often prefer to remain in their ignorance,</i></b> content with simplicity, or worse, indulgence in foolish behaviors.<br><br>
    
    The term "simple" in this context does not imply stupidity but refers to being uninformed or naïve. These are people who could seek wisdom, but choose not to. Similarly, the word "scoffer" comes from the Hebrew word <i>lēsim</i>, referring to those who mock or arrogantly dismiss wisdom. <b><i>These are individuals who not only ignore wisdom but mock it, ridiculing it rather than listening and applying it. This scoffing attitude is also reflected in other biblical passages, such as where mockery is equated with rejection of God's guidance.</i></b><br><br>
    
    In conclusion, this passage in Proverbs vividly paints a picture of wisdom crying out to all, yet being ignored by many. <i>It warns that the choice to remain simple or to mock wisdom is not merely an innocent oversight but a deliberate rejection. The consequences of this rejection are serious, as wisdom offers life and truth to those who heed her voice. But for those who ignore it, foolishness and arrogance take root, leading to downfall and regret.   </i>
