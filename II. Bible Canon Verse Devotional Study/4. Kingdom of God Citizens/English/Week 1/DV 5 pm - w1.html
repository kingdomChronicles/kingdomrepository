As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

  <h2>Proverbs 1:20-21</h2>
  <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>

  <p>
    <sup>20</sup> Wisdom shouts in the streets. She cries out in the public square. 
    <sup>21</sup> She calls to the crowds along the main street, to those gathered in front of the city gate:

  <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

  <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Call of Wisdom</b></p>

  <p>In the early chapters of Proverbs, Solomon presents wisdom as far more than just the accumulation of facts or intellectual understanding. He perceives wisdom as a divine gift—a practical, moral, and spiritual guide that enables a person to live a righteous life in alignment with God’s will. Solomon’s own life reflects this value, as he famously chose wisdom over riches or fame when God gave him the opportunity to ask for anything. For Solomon, wisdom surpasses all other blessings in its ability to guide individuals toward truth, righteousness, and a deeper relationship with God. <br><br>

  In Proverbs 1:20-21, wisdom is personified as a woman crying out in public places—the streets, marketplaces, and city gates. This imagery is not accidental; it underscores the accessibility of wisdom to anyone who seeks it. Solomon uses this metaphor to teach an essential truth: wisdom is not hidden or exclusive but open and available to all, regardless of one’s social status or background. The cry of wisdom is public and urgent, and it demands attention, calling individuals to embrace her in their everyday lives. <br><br>
  
  The marketplace, in ancient times, was the heart of the community—a place where people from all walks of life gathered to trade, converse, and conduct business. By placing wisdom in such a visible and active setting, Solomon shows that wisdom is woven into the fabric of daily life. It is not limited to scholars or intellectuals but is available to everyone: the merchant, the laborer, the rich, and the poor. Wisdom cries out in spaces where people live and work, making herself known to all who are willing to listen. <br><br>
  
  Moreover, wisdom’s loud and persistent cry in the streets implies that she is not passive or silent. She actively reaches out to people, ensuring that her voice is heard even amidst the noise and distractions of life. This teaches us that wisdom is ever-present and available, even for those who are not actively seeking her. She calls to everyone, leaving no one with an excuse for failing to hear her voice. <br><br>
  
  However, there is a clear tension in this passage between wisdom and the distractions of life. The busy streets and crowded city gates symbolize the noise and busyness that often prevent people from paying attention to wisdom’s call. Many pass by without noticing or responding, preoccupied with their own immediate concerns. This mirrors the human tendency to ignore wisdom because of the allure of short-term gains or the distractions of daily life. Solomon’s message is clear: <b><i>while wisdom is always present and available, many choose to ignore her because they are absorbed in the fleeting concerns of the world.</i></b> <br><br>
  
  This contrast between wisdom and sin is sharp, as seen earlier in Proverbs 1:11-14. Sin entices with promises of quick rewards and instant gratification, while wisdom, though harder to attain, offers lasting fulfillment and righteousness. <b><i>Solomon urges his readers to understand that true wisdom often requires patience, discipline, and effort—qualities that bring about enduring success and peace.</i></b> While the path of sin may seem easy and appealing, its rewards are fleeting and lead to destruction. Wisdom, on the other hand, offers eternal benefits. <br><br>
  
  Spiritually, this passage carries profound meaning. Wisdom, in a broader sense, represents God’s truth and guidance, which are available to anyone who seeks them. Solomon emphasizes that no one can claim they lacked the opportunity to gain wisdom, as she is constantly calling out in the public spaces of life. The Scriptures confirm this truth in Romans 1:18-20 and Matthew 7:7, where it is made clear that God provides enough knowledge for people to make the right decisions. Ignoring wisdom, then, is not a matter of ignorance but of willful choice. <b><i>Solomon’s words remind us that the responsibility to seek wisdom—and to follow it—falls on each individual.</i></b> <br><br>
  
  In conclusion, <b><i>wisdom is eagerly sought by the righteous and the wise, while it is often avoided and rejected by the wicked and the foolish.</i></b> Proverbs 1:20-21 reminds us that wisdom calls out openly to all, but only those who are willing to listen and embrace it will benefit from its guidance. It is a divine gift that leads to righteous living and a deeper connection with God, yet its value is missed by those who choose to ignore it. Ultimately, wisdom offers a path toward living in harmony with God's will, but it requires a heart that is willing to seek and accept it.
