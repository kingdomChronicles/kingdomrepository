        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

                <h2>Proverbs 1:1</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p class="chapterTitle">Solomon’s Wisdom and the Promise of God: A Reflection on His Legacy and Its Relevance to Us Today</p>
  
                <p>The book of Proverbs, ascribed to Solomon, son of David, holds a special place in the biblical canon, not only because of its profound wisdom but also because of the significance of Solomon’s lineage in God’s overarching plan. Solomon’s authorship of Proverbs is especially important because it connects to the divine promises made to his father, David, in 2 Samuel 7:11–16. Through the prophet Nathan, God made three key promises to David. First, that David’s son, Solomon, would build the Temple of God. Second, that Solomon would stray from God, but God would discipline him as a father, without withdrawing His love. And third, that David’s dynasty would be established forever, a promise that echoes as a Messianic prophecy, pointing to the eternal reign of Christ. Solomon, thus, stood as a crucial figure, both in the history of Israel and in the future hope of the Messiah. <br><br>

                Despite being endowed with great wisdom and intelligence by God (1 Kings 3:1–15; 2 Chronicles 1:7–13), Solomon’s life is a sobering reminder that possessing wisdom does not always equate to consistently making the right choices. His journey, as depicted in the book of Ecclesiastes, reveals his personal quest for meaning and fulfillment. Despite having vast knowledge, wealth, and power, Solomon ultimately recognized that all of life’s pursuits are futile without God. His reflections in Ecclesiastes underscore the ultimate truth: that God’s ways are indeed the best ways. This resonates with the lesson that wisdom, though essential, must be coupled with obedience to God for it to bear lasting fruit.<br><br>
                
                God’s promise to Solomon was clear—He would be with him, guiding him as a father guides a son, even when Solomon would fall short. This covenant was not based on Solomon’s perfection but on God’s steadfast love and faithfulness. Similarly, as modern-day believers who have entered the Kingdom of God, we are recipients of God’s promises. While Solomon was a recipient of the promise concerning the continuation of David’s house, we now stand under the fulfillment of that very promise through Jesus Christ. In these last days, as part of God’s chosen people, we are called to embrace His promises to us as we strive to walk in obedience and faith.<br><br>
                
                God’s dealings with Solomon teach us that wisdom is a gift, but our ultimate security lies not in human intellect, but in our relationship with God. As we study Solomon’s life and the promises that God made to him, we must also recognize the promises God has made to us today. We, too, are chosen by God to live out His purposes in these last days, to walk in the fullness of His covenant, and to trust in His unfailing love, even when we fall short.<br><br>
                
                Just as Solomon received the promise of God’s discipline and unwavering love, we, too, are under His care. God has promised that as His chosen people, He will never forsake us. He will guide us, even when we falter, and will continue to refine us as we grow in faith. Solomon’s wisdom invites us to reflect on the lessons of his life, but more importantly, to trust in the God who was faithful to him. The legacy of Solomon is not just his great wisdom, but the enduring faithfulness of God, who continues to fulfill His promises to His people.<br><br>
                
                Today, as part of God’s Kingdom, we are called to study His promises and embrace them with faith. Just as God’s hand was upon Solomon, leading and guiding him through both triumph and failure, so too is God’s hand upon us. We are called to not only learn from Solomon’s successes and failures but to apply God’s wisdom to our own lives. As recipients of His promise in these last days, we are urged to walk in the knowledge that God is faithful, that His promises endure, and that our security lies in His everlasting love.<br><br>
                
                In conclusion, while Solomon was a recipient of God’s promises, we, too, as those chosen by God in these last days, are called to study, understand, and accept the promises God has given us. Just as God remained faithful to Solomon, He remains faithful to us, guiding us with wisdom and love as we journey toward the fulfillment of His ultimate plan. </p>

                <p>Your entry into the Kingdom of God is proof that you are one of God's chosen instruments to continue the work of His appointed righteous remnant, who will carry out and fulfill the prophecies declared by the prophets regarding the events of the last days. <br><br>

                <b><i>Question: Are you ready to fulfill your calling to be an instrument of God in accomplishing His plan in these last days?</i></b> </p>
