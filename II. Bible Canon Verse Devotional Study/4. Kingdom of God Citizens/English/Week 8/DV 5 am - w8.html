        <h2>Proverbs 4:14</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NASB (New American Standard Bible)</p>
          

        <p><sup>14</sup> "Do not enter the path of the wicked And do not proceed in the way of evil people."</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Wisdom of Avoiding the Path of the Wicked</b></p>

        <p> Fathers often impart wisdom to their children, especially lessons shaped by personal trials and mistakes. King Solomon, known for his God-given wisdom was no exception. <br><br>

        <i><b>1 Kings 3:5-9 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>5</sup> That night the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream, and God said, “What do you want? Ask, and I will give it to you!” <sup>6</sup> Solomon replied, “You showed great and faithful love to your servant my father, David, because he was honest and true and faithful to you. And you have continued to show this great and faithful love to him today by giving him a son to sit on his throne. <sup>7</sup> “Now, O Lord my God, you have made me king instead of my father, David, but I am like a little child who doesn’t know his way around. <sup>8</sup> And here I am in the midst of your own chosen people, a nation so great and numerous they cannot be counted! <sup>9</sup> Give me an understanding heart so that I can govern your people well and know the difference between right and wrong. For who by himself is able to govern this great people of yours?”<br><br>
    
        <b>1 Kings 3:10-15 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>10</sup> The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for wisdom. <sup>11</sup> So God replied, “Because you have asked for wisdom in governing my people with justice and have not asked for a long life or wealth or the death of your enemies— <sup>12</sup> I will give you what you asked for! I will give you a wise and understanding heart such as no one else has had or ever will have! <sup>13</sup> And I will also give you what you did not ask for—riches and fame! No other king in all the world will be compared to you for the rest of your life! <sup>14</sup> And if you follow me and obey my decrees and my commands as your father, David, did, I will give you a long life.” <sup>15</sup> Then Solomon woke up and realized it had been a dream. He returned to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant, where he sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings. Then he invited all his officials to a great banquet. </i><br><br>
        
        Despite his profound understanding, Solomon himself faltered in his later years. Yet, he reflected on his errors and shared his conclusions, urging others to embrace God's ways wholeheartedly. One such nugget of wisdom is found in Proverbs 4:14, where he warns against associating with the wicked and walking in their ways.<br><br>
        
        This advice holds particular significance for the young, who are often impressionable and vulnerable to external influences. Solomon's warning to avoid "the path of the wicked" and "the way of evil people" underscores the importance of staying vigilant against specific relationships that lead to moral corruption. The use of the definite article "the" suggests a deliberate caution against individuals who embody wickedness, not just abstract notions of evil.<br><br>
        
        Earlier in Proverbs, Solomon offers similar guidance: "My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent". This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who spoke of two distinct paths in life. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 7:13-14 KJV</b><br>
        <sup>13</sup>  Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: <sup>14</sup> because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</i><br><br>
        
        In Matthew, Jesus emphasize the necessity of choosing the right path, even when it is difficult or unpopular.<br><br>
        
        Peer pressure often tempts even believers to stray into wicked paths. However, Solomon's warning and Jesus' teachings remind us that faith and obedience are crucial for avoiding sin and its destructive consequences. It is naïve and dangerous to think one can dabble in wrongdoing without being affected. Proverbs 13:20 reinforces this truth: <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 13:20 NLT</b><br>
        Walk with the wise and become wise; associate with fools and get in trouble.</i><br><br>
        
        Solomon's words in Proverbs 4:14 serve as a timeless call to exercise discernment in relationships and life choices. They remind us to guard our hearts, choose our companions wisely, and walk in the way of righteousness, even when the path is narrow and challenging. In doing so, we align ourselves with God's will and avoid the snares that lead to destruction. Let us heed this wisdom and strive to walk in obedience and faith, choosing the path that leads to eternal life.
