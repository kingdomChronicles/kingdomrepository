        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 4:16</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p><sup>16</sup> "For evil people can’t sleep until they’ve done their evil deed for the day. They can’t rest until they’ve caused someone to stumble."</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>A Restless Life that Sin Brings</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 4:16 says, "For evil people can’t sleep until they’ve done their evil deed for the day. They can’t rest until they’ve caused someone to stumble." This verse paints a vivid picture of the restless and destructive nature of those who reject godly wisdom. It reveals the consuming power of sin, not only over the sinner but also over those whom the sinner seeks to corrupt. Solomon’s warning is both a condemnation of wickedness and an invitation to consider the peace found in following God. <br><br>

        This verse highlights the pitiable condition of those enslaved to sin. Far from experiencing satisfaction, evil people are depicted as restless, unable to sleep or find peace until they commit acts of harm. This is not meant to be taken as a literal diagnosis of insomnia but as an example of hyperbole—a common technique in wisdom literature. The exaggeration emphasizes the intensity of their depravity: their thoughts and desires are consumed by sin, driving them to harm others. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 10:10a NKJV</b><br>
        The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.</i><br><br>
        
        This aligns with Jesus’ warning that the thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy, while God offers abundant life.<br><br>
        
        Solomon's imagery also exposes the contagious nature of wickedness. Evildoers are not content to travel the path of destruction alone; they actively seek to lead others astray. This truth is tragically illustrated in the days of Noah. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Genesis 6:5 ESV</b><br>
        The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. </i><br><br>
        
        The verse describes humanity as wholly consumed by wickedness, with every thought being "only evil continually." This moral corruption spread throughout civilization, leaving Noah and his family as the sole righteous exception. Similarly, as the return of Christ approaches, wickedness will grow more pervasive.<br><br> 
        
        <i><b>2 Timothy 3:1-6 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>1</sup> But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. <sup>2</sup> For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, <sup>3</sup> heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, <sup>4</sup> treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, <sup>5</sup> having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. <sup>6</sup> For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, </i><br><br>
        
        Paul warns that the last days will be marked by self-centeredness, brutality, and a disdain for good. Worse still, in the tribulation period, the false prophet will compel humanity to worship the beast and embrace evil collectively.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Revelation 3:13-17 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>13</sup>  “Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches.  <sup>14</sup>  “Write this letter to the angel of the church in Laodicea. This is the message from the one who is the Amen—the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God’s new creation: <sup>15</sup>  “I know all the things you do, that you are neither hot nor cold. I wish that you were one or the other! <sup>16</sup> But since you are like lukewarm water, neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth! <sup>17</sup> You say, ‘I am rich. I have everything I want. I don’t need a thing!’ And you don’t realize that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. </i><br><br>
        
        The restless life of sin is contrasted sharply with the peace found in a life rooted in God’s wisdom. Proverbs 3:24 assures that those who follow God will "lie down and not be afraid," finding rest and security. Sin, on the other hand, robs people of peace and drives them into deeper misery. Rather than fulfilling their desires, wickedness enslaves and consumes, leaving them perpetually empty and restless.<br><br>
        
        Proverbs 4:16 serves as a warning against the destructive power of sin and the company of evildoers. It urges believers to recognize the misery that comes with rejecting God’s wisdom and to avoid those who would lead them astray. At the same time, it points to the abundant life and peace that only God can provide. By choosing the path of righteousness, we not only find rest for ourselves but also reflect God’s light to a world trapped in darkness.
