        <h2>Proverbs 4:15</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>

        

        <p><sup>15</sup> Don’t even think about it; don’t go that way. Turn away and keep moving.</p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Turning Away from Evil</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 4:15 commands, "Don’t even think about it; don’t go that way. Turn away and keep moving." These words are part of Solomon's urgent plea to his son, warning him to completely avoid the path of wickedness. Solomon's repetition and emphasis in this passage reveal the critical importance of rejecting sin and staying on the path of righteousness. His warnings draw from his own experiences, showing that the consequences of choosing evil can be devastating. <br><br>

        In this verse, Solomon issues four specific commands: avoid, do not go, turn away, and pass on. Each offers a practical step in resisting temptation and remaining steadfast in righteousness.<br><br>
        
        First, "avoid" evil emphasizes the importance of steering clear of sinful people and behaviors altogether. Just as men are often swayed by their friends' invitations to drinking sessions, sometimes giving in out of curiosity to "try it out," so too are many young people led astray into premature sexual experiences. Such actions must be avoided, as they deviate from God's design, and instead, they should choose to wait for the right time under His guidance. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Timothy 3:16-17 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>16</sup> All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right. <sup>17</sup> God uses it to prepare and equip his people to do every good work.</i><br><br>
        
        Scripture, such as stated, assures us that God’s Word provides guidance in avoiding evil, even when sin appears disguised as something good. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Corinthians 11:14 NLT</b><br>
        But I am not surprised! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. </i><br><br>
        
        Avoidance requires proactive choices, such as staying away from influences that encourage depravity. By choosing obedience to God’s Word, we safeguard ourselves from the deceptive allure of sin.<br><br>
        
        Second, "don’t go on it" reinforces the necessity of rejecting the temptation to explore or experiment with sin. There is no such thing as a "safe" amount of sin. Trying to indulge in evil "just a little" or "for now" only invites danger and spiritual harm. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalms 16:11 NLT</b><br>
        You will show me the way of life, granting me the joy of your presence and the pleasures of living with you forever.</i><br><br>
        
        The verse assures us that true fulfillment is found in God's path of life, where joy and eternal pleasures abound. Pursuing sin leads to emptiness, but following God brings lasting satisfaction.<br><br>
        
        Third, "turn away" acknowledges the reality of temptation, even for those who try to avoid sin. When tempted, believers are encouraged to seek the Lord's help for strength and grace. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 Corinthians 10:13 ESV</b><br>
        No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.</i><br><br>
        
        God promises to provide a way of escape in every situation, ensuring that no one is ever "forced" to sin. Turning away requires humility and reliance on God’s power, reminding us that we can always choose righteousness over rebellion.<br><br>
        
        Finally, "pass on" calls us to actively pursue righteousness and stay focused on God's will. Resisting sin is not merely about saying "no" to evil but also about saying "yes" to God. By continuing on the path of righteousness, we strengthen our resolve against distractions and temptations. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 Corinthians 9:24 ESV</b><br>
        Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. <br><br>
        
        <b>Hebrews 12:1 NKJV</b><br>
        Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, </i><br><br>
        
        As the verses urge, we must press forward with purpose, running the race of faith with endurance and focus.<br><br>
        
        Solomon's wisdom in Proverbs 4:15 reminds us that avoiding sin requires intentionality. It is not enough to passively hope for righteousness; we must actively choose to avoid, turn away, and keep moving toward God’s path. By staying rooted in His Word and seeking His guidance, we protect ourselves from the snares of evil and experience the fullness of joy and peace that only He can provide. This verse is both a warning and a promise: by deliberately turning away from wickedness and pursuing God, we find life, freedom, and purpose.
