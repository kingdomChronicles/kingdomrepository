        </center>


        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <p><sup>24</sup> "But since you refuse to listen when I call and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand."</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Series Lesson: The Consequence of Neglecting Wisdom </b></p>

        <p> The verse from Proverbs 1:24 addresses the theme of neglecting wisdom, highlighting the consequences that befall those who refuse to heed her call. It provides a clear picture of a universal offer: wisdom is freely available to all, but its blessings are conditional on one’s response. The passage emphasizes the importance of listening to wisdom and the danger of ignoring it. <br><br>

        In verse 23, wisdom is depicted as a woman calling out in public spaces, offering her guidance to everyone. It presents wisdom as something accessible and ready to be shared with all who will listen. No one can say they did not receive the offer or the opportunity to embrace it. This represents God's generous willingness to give wisdom to those who seek it. James 1:5 supports this, stating that God gives wisdom generously to all who ask for it. The promise of wisdom is available to anyone, but the key is listening and responding. Verse 23 provides hope and encouragement for those who take the initiative to follow wisdom’s call, assuring them of the rewards that come with obedience. <br><br>
        
        However, Proverbs 1:24 shifts the tone by presenting the consequence of refusing to listen to wisdom. It is a somber reminder that ignoring wisdom leads to destruction. Solomon, in his wisdom, paints a vivid picture of the two possible responses to wisdom: either a person listens and receives the benefits of understanding, or they reject it and face the repercussions. There is no middle ground. This duality reflects the nature of human choice in the face of divine wisdom. Everyone is exposed to the truth and the knowledge of God through creation and conscience, as affirmed in <br><br>
        
        <b>Romans 1:18-20 ESV</b> - <i>
        
        <sup>18</sup> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. 
        <sup>19</sup> For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. 
        <sup>20</sup> For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. </i>
        <br><br>
        
        The failure to respond positively to wisdom means actively rejecting it, and such rejection carries significant consequences. <br><br>
        
        The image of God or wisdom "stretching out a hand" emphasizes the urgency of the call. It symbolizes an active, compassionate offer of help, guidance, and salvation. However, the passage highlights that despite this call and outstretched hand, many refuse to listen. This refusal is not mere ignorance but a deliberate neglect. Such disregard for the offer of wisdom becomes the beginning of impending judgment. Just like in the time of Noah, when people rejected God's offer to know Him and fear Him, all living beings perished except Noah's family. <br><br>
        
        Solomon’s message is clear: those who refuse to listen to wisdom are making a choice that will ultimately lead to their downfall. Wisdom’s call is not one that can be ignored without consequence. The refusal to embrace wisdom leads to a path filled with regret, and the following verses in Proverbs outline the fate of those who remain unresponsive. The fact that wisdom is available to all places the responsibility squarely on each person. It is not for lack of opportunity but rather for the hardness of heart that people miss out on the blessings wisdom provides. <br><br>
        
        In conclusion, Proverbs 1:24 serves as a warning to all who hear wisdom's call but choose not to respond. Wisdom is not something distant or difficult to obtain; it is freely offered to all. But with the offer comes the responsibility to listen and obey. Those who reject it are not merely missing out on knowledge but are setting themselves on a course toward destruction. Solomon urges us to choose wisely, to listen to the voice of wisdom before it is too late, and to avoid the disastrous consequences of ignoring her call. </p>
