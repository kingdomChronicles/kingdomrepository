        <h2>Proverbs 3:6</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NKJV (New King James Version)</p>

        

        <p><sup>6</sup> In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths.</p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Acknowledging the Lord for Perfect Direction</b></p>

        <p> 
          Proverbs 3:6 declares, <i>“In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.”</i> This verse serves as a guiding principle for anyone seeking clarity and purpose in life. Whether we are making significant life decisions—such as buying a home, choosing a career, or entering into a relationship—or navigating everyday tasks, acknowledging the Lord ensures that our choices align with His perfect will. By doing so, we invite His guidance, protection, and blessings, enabling us to avoid unnecessary struggles and pitfalls. <br><br>

          The apostle James emphasizes the importance of consulting God in our plans. <br><br>

          <i><b>James 4:13-17 NLT</b><br>
          <sup>13</sup> Look here, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we are going to a certain town and will stay there a year. We will do business there and make a profit.” <sup>14</sup> How do you know what your life will be like tomorrow? Your life is like the morning fog—it’s here a little while, then it’s gone. <sup>15</sup> What you ought to say is, “If the Lord wants us to, we will live and do this or that.” <sup>16</sup> Otherwise you are boasting about your own pretentious plans, and all such boasting is evil. <sup>17</sup> Remember, it is sin to know what you ought to do and then not do it.</i><br><br>

          In the above verses, the writer warns everyone against self-reliance, urging believers to seek the Lord’s will in all things at all times. Acknowledging God doesn’t guarantee answers to every question or the removal of all challenges, but it does grant us the assurance of walking in the path He has prepared for us. Life’s difficulties are compounded by poor decisions, and following God’s plan is a sure way to minimize avoidable struggles.<br><br>

          <i><b>Genesis 24:12-14 NLT</b><br>
          <sup>12</sup> “O Lord, God of my master, Abraham,” he prayed. “Please give me success today, and show unfailing love to my master, Abraham. <sup>13</sup> See, I am standing here beside this spring, and the young women of the town are coming out to draw water. <sup>14</sup> This is my request. I will ask one of them, ‘Please give me a drink from your jug.’ If she says, ‘Yes, have a drink, and I will water your camels, too!’—let her be the one you have selected as Isaac’s wife. This is how I will know that you have shown unfailing love to my master.”</i><br><br>

          The story of Abraham's servant in Genesis 24 exemplifies this truth. Entrusted with the critical task of finding a wife for Isaac, Abraham’s servant began his journey with prayer, seeking the Lord’s guidance. As he arrived in Nahor, he prayed at the city’s spring, asking for success in identifying the right woman. The Lord answered his prayer, leading him to Rebekah, who was divinely chosen to be Isaac’s wife. The servant’s response reflects his acknowledgment of God’s faithfulness: “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His steadfast love and His faithfulness”. <br><br>

          <i><b>Genesis 24:27 NLT</b><br>
            “Praise the Lord, the God of my master, Abraham,” he said. “The Lord has shown unfailing love and faithfulness to my master, for he has led me straight to my master’s relatives.”</i><br><br>

          This narrative demonstrates that when we acknowledge God, we invite His direction and intervention in our lives. Like Abraham’s servant, we are reminded to start with prayer, trust God’s timing, and recognize His hand in our outcomes.<br><br>

          Ultimately, Proverbs 3:6 encourages believers to cultivate a daily habit of seeking God’s guidance. By surrendering our ways to Him, we trust that He will not only illuminate our path but also remove obstacles that hinder our journey. Whether we face small decisions or life-altering choices, acknowledging the Lord assures us of His wisdom, grace, and perfect plan for our lives.
