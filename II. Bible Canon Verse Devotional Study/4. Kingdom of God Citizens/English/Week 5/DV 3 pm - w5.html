        </center>

        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 3:9-10</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>

        <p><sup>9</sup> Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the best part of everything you produce.
        <sup>10</sup> Then he will fill your barns with grain, and your vats will overflow with good wine.</p>

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b></b></p> -->

        <p> 
          This verses promises that the Lord will reward faithful giving. This echoes the promises of God to Israel: <br><br>

          <i><b>Deuteronomy 28:11-12 ESV</b><br>
          <sup>11</sup> And the Lord will make you abound in prosperity, in the fruit of your womb and in the fruit of your livestock and in the fruit of your ground, within the land that the Lord swore to your fathers to give you. <sup>12</sup> The Lord will open to you his good treasury, the heavens, to give the rain to your land in its season and to bless all the work of your hands. And you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow. </i><br><br>
          
          As always, context matters when interpreting these Scriptures. Deuteronomy's promises are meant for the nation of Israel, not for all people at all times. A "proverb," by definition, is a general statement. Solomon is not making an ironclad guarantee to all people in all circumstances. And yet, those who honor God set themselves up for better outcomes than those who live in rebellion.<br><br>
          
          The Lord has not promised Christians material prosperity in return for faithful giving. However, He has promised to meet all our needs. <br><br>
          
          <i><b>Matthew 6:33 KJV</b><br>
          But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. </i><br><br>
          
          Paul acknowledged the faithful giving of the Philippian church, and promised, <br><br>
          
          <i><b>Philippians 4:19 NKJV</b><br>
          And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus. </i><br><br>
          
          It is noteworthy that he did not say "out of His riches," but "according to His riches." God is a generous giver, but it is unlikely He will pour blessings into a closed hand. He loves and rewards a generous giver.
