        <h2>Proverbs 3:9</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p><sup>9</sup> "Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the best part of everything you produce."</p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Honoring God with Our Wealth and Possessions</b></p>

        <p> As children of God, we often find ourselves asking how we can truly honor the Lord with the blessings He has given us. Proverbs 3:9 provides a clear directive: we are called to honor God with our wealth and the best of our resources. But what does this truly mean, and how can we apply it in our lives today? By examining this verse and its biblical context, we can better understand God's desire for His people to prioritize Him in every aspect of their lives. <br><br>

        <b>The Biblical Principle of Honoring God with Wealth</b><br><br>
        
        In ancient Israel, God commanded His people to give the firstfruits of their harvests to Him. This was not merely an act of giving but a demonstration of trust and gratitude for His provision. The Israelites also practiced tithing, giving a tenth of their income or produce to the Lord as a way to support the temple, the priests, and the less fortunate.<br><br>
        
        However, after Solomon's reign, the nation of Israel drifted from these practices. In Malachi 3:10, the Lord accused His people of robbing Him by withholding their tithes and offerings. He called them to obedience, promising blessings for their faithfulness: <i> "Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test...if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need."</i><br><br>

        <b>Giving in the New Testament</b><br><br>
        
        While tithing was a specific command for Israel, the New Testament offers a broader principle for giving. The Apostle Paul encourages believers to give regularly, generously, and cheerfully. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Corinthians 9:7 ESV</b><br>
        Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. </i><br><br>
        
        Jesus Himself highlighted the heart behind the act of giving when He praised the widow who gave two small coins, stating that her sacrificial giving was more valuable than the abundance of the rich.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Mark 12:44 NLT</b><br>
        For they gave a tiny part of their surplus, but she, poor as she is, has given everything she had to live on.”</i><br><br>
        
        <b>A Modern Reflection</b><br><br>
        
        Honoring God with wealth is not limited to financial giving; it extends to how we manage all our resources, including time, talents, and possessions. It is an act of worship that acknowledges God’s lordship over every area of our lives. When we give, we declare that our trust is not in material wealth but in the One who richly provides for all our needs.<br><br>
        
        As we reflect on Proverbs 3:9, let us ask ourselves: Are we honoring God with our best, or are we holding back? May we strive to be like the widow who gave her best, trusting that God, who sees our hearts, will reward us abundantly.
