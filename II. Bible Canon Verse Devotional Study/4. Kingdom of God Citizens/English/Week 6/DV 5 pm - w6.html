        <h2>Proverbs 3:25-26</h2>

          <sup>25</sup> Do not be afraid of sudden terror, Nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes.
          <sup>26</sup> For the Lord will be your confidence, and will keep your foot from being caught.

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Our Confidence in God</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 3:25–26 reminds us of a profound truth: “Do not be afraid of sudden terror, nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes. For the Lord will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught”. These verses reassure us that our security and protection rest in God. Despite the challenges and dangers that arise unexpectedly, the Lord promises to sustain and guard His children, giving us confidence to face life with courage. <br><br>

        When we accept Jesus as our Savior through genuine repentance and turning away from our sinful activities, we are adopted into God's family and become His friends. However, this also places us in the crosshairs of the Devil and the unregenerate world. The hostility we face is not surprising; as Jesus said, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 15:18 NLT</b><br>
        “If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first. </i><br><br>
        
        Yet, we are called to stand firm, knowing that the Lord is with us. The verses preceding this passage emphasize the peace and security that come from living with godly wisdom and discretion. While our actions cannot earn salvation, they demonstrate our faith and trust in God. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>James 2:18-20 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>18</sup> Now someone may argue, “Some people have faith; others have good deeds.” But I say, “How can you show me your faith if you don’t have good deeds? I will show you my faith by my good deeds.” <sup>19</sup> You say you have faith, for you believe that there is one God. Good for you! Even the demons believe this, and they tremble in terror. <sup>20</sup> How foolish! Can’t you see that faith without good deeds is useless?</i><br><br>
        
        By walking in obedience to God’s Word, we avoid the pitfalls of sin and grow in confidence that He is guiding and protecting us.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Hebrews 11:13-16 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>13</sup> All these people died still believing what God had promised them. They did not receive what was promised, but they saw it all from a distance and welcomed it. They agreed that they were foreigners and nomads here on earth. <sup>14</sup> Obviously people who say such things are looking forward to a country they can call their own. <sup>15</sup> If they had longed for the country they came from, they could have gone back. <sup>16</sup> But they were looking for a better place, a heavenly homeland. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.</i><br><br>
        
        Jesus prepared His followers for the challenges of this life, stating, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 16:33 NLT</b><br>
        I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me. Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows. But take heart, because I have overcome the world.”</i><br><br>
        
        Similarly, the apostle Paul warned that living a godly life would invite persecution: <br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Timothy 3:12 ESV</b><br>
        Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,</i> <br><br>
        
        Yet, He also proclaimed that we are,<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 8:37 KJV</b><br>
        Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</i> <br><br>
        
        This victorious outlook is echoed by the apostle John, who declared that our faith in Jesus makes us overcomers. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 John 5:5 KJV</b><br>
        Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? </i><br><br>
        
        Proverbs 3:25–26 is a powerful reminder of the unwavering security we have in the Lord. Though the world may bring terror and trouble, we need not fear. Our confidence is in God, who keeps us from being ensnared by evil. As we trust in His promises and walk in His ways, we are assured of His presence and protection, enabling us to live boldly as His children and ambassadors.
