        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 3:24</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NKJV (New King James Version)</p>

        <p>
          <sup>24</sup> When you lie down, you will not be afraid; Yes, you will lie down and your sleep will be sweet.
        </p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Finding Peaceful Sleep Through Trust in God</b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 3:24 says, "When you lie down, you will not be afraid; Yes, you will lie down and your sleep will be sweet". This verse is a comforting reminder of the blessings that come from obedience to God and a life grounded in His wisdom. It highlights the peace and assurance that believers can experience when they trust in the Lord, knowing He watches over them at all times. <br><br>

        This promise is rooted in the broader context of Proverbs 3, where the benefits of godly wisdom and obedience are outlined. Walking in obedience to God is not a guarantee of a trouble-free life, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 16:33 NLT</b><br>
        I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me. Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows. But take heart, because I have overcome the world.”</i><br><br>
        
        But it does spare us from many of the consequences and fears that come from rebellion and sin. Proverbs 3:23 assures that those who follow God's path will avoid unnecessary stumbling, paving the way for a life of stability and peace.<br><br>
        
        Fear and anxiety, common disruptions to sleep, are often alleviated when we entrust our cares to the Lord. This verse reminds us that godly wisdom leads to peaceful rest because we are confident that God is in control. David echoed this truth in Psalm, where he wrote,<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalms 4:8 NLT</b><br>
        In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, O Lord, will keep me safe.</i><br><br>
        
        In God's protection and providence allows us to release our worries and rest securely in His care.<br><br>
        
        When we live with a clear conscience and honor the Lord, we are not weighed down by the guilt or fear of our actions. Our sleep becomes sweet because we trust that God is watching over us, both during the day and at night. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 28:20 NKJV</b><br>
        teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.</i><br><br>
        
        Jesus' promise in here in Matthew, reassures us of His constant presence, which quiets our fears and grants us peace.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Acts 12:1-12 NKJV</b><br>
        <sup>1</sup> Now about that time Herod the king stretched out his hand to harass some from the church. <sup>2</sup> Then he killed James the brother of John with the sword. <sup>3</sup> And because he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to seize Peter also. Now it was during the Days of Unleavened Bread. <sup>4</sup> So when he had arrested him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to keep him, intending to bring him before the people after Passover.  <sup>5</sup> Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church. <sup>6</sup> And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison. <sup>7</sup> Now behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the prison; and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, “Arise quickly!” And his chains fell off his hands. <sup>8</sup> Then the angel said to him, “Gird yourself and tie on your sandals”; and so he did. And he said to him, “Put on your garment and follow me.” <sup>9</sup> So he went out and followed him, and did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. <sup>10</sup> When they were past the first and the second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them of its own accord; and they went out and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him. <sup>11</sup> And when Peter had come to himself, he said, “Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel, and has delivered me from the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Jewish people.” <sup>12</sup> So, when he had considered this, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together praying. </i><br><br>
        
        The story of Peter in Acts is a powerful example of this truth. Despite being imprisoned and facing possible execution, Peter slept soundly, guarded by soldiers on either side of him. His rest in such a dire situation speaks volumes about his trust in God's promises. Perhaps Peter remembered Jesus' prophecy in John,<br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 21:18 NLT</b><br>
        “I tell you the truth, when you were young, you were able to do as you liked; you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and others will dress you and take you where you don’t want to go.” </i><br><br>
        
        That he would die as an old man and concluded, "This is not the end of my story." Or perhaps his peace came from knowing that God was sovereign and would sustain him regardless of the outcome.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 3:24 teaches us the importance of relying on God's promises. Wisdom calls us to trust Him wholeheartedly, freeing us from fear and anxiety. This trust transforms our nights, allowing us to lie down in safety and enjoy sweet, restful sleep, knowing that God is always with us. In a world full of uncertainties, this verse reminds us that true peace is found in the arms of our Heavenly Father.
