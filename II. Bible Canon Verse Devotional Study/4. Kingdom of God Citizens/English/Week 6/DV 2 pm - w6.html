        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 3:20</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>

        

        <p><sup>20</sup> By his knowledge the deep fountains of the earth burst forth, and the dew settles beneath the night sky.</p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>God's Wisdom in Creation and Providence</b></p>

        <p> The Bible consistently extols God’s infinite wisdom and knowledge, as seen in His creation and providential care over the world. Proverbs 3:20 reminds us of God's unparalleled understanding by pointing to two natural phenomena: the bursting forth of the deep fountains of the earth and the gentle settling of dew at night. These images not only highlight His sovereignty over creation but also underscore His ability to fulfill His purposes through His divine knowledge. <br><br>

        Solomon’s reference to the "deep fountains" recalls the catastrophic flood in Noah’s time. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Genesis 7:11 KJV</b><br>
        In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. </i><br><br>
        
        The Book of Genesis vividly describes the moment when "the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened." This was a monumental event in human history, showcasing God's power to execute judgment and His wisdom to fulfill His plans. Despite the scoffing of unbelievers in Noah's day, God’s knowledge was made evident when He caused the deep reservoirs beneath the earth to release their waters, silencing the skeptics and demonstrating His authority over nature. This event serves as a sobering reminder of God's justice and the certainty of His promises.<br><br>
        
        The imagery of dew settling beneath the night sky also reflects God's wisdom and care. Unlike the dramatic bursting of the deep fountains, dew is quiet and gentle, yet it sustains life in profound ways. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Job 38:25-28 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>25</sup> “Who has cleft a channel for the torrents of rain and a way for the thunderbolt, <sup>26</sup> to bring rain on a land where no man is, on the desert in which there is no man, <sup>27</sup> to satisfy the waste and desolate land, and to make the ground sprout with grass? <sup>28</sup> “Has the rain a father, or who has begotten the drops of dew?</i><br><br>
        
        In the Book of Job, God questions Job, highlighting how He provides rain even in uninhabited places to nourish barren lands and cause grass to grow. This shows that God’s wisdom operates not only in grand displays of power but also in the subtle, life-giving processes of nature. Dew and rain, in their quiet consistency, reveal a Creator who sustains His creation with precision and purpose.<br><br>
        
        Together, these images from Proverbs 3:20 illustrate the depth of God's knowledge. Whether through the mighty bursting forth of waters in judgment or the gentle provision of dew in the stillness of night, God’s wisdom is evident. For believers, this serves as both a source of awe and comfort. It assures us that the same God who governs the forces of nature also oversees our lives with perfect understanding.<br><br>
        
        In conclusion, the contrast between the foolish and the wise serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of trusting in God's wisdom. While those who reject God’s existence walk towards destruction, those who place their faith in His guidance find security and purpose. Just as God’s wisdom shaped the world, we can be confident that He will guide and sustain us through every trial. Solomon’s words call us to stand in awe of God’s creation and rest in His infinite wisdom, for He is not only the Creator of all things but also the Sustainer of life itself.
