        <h2>Proverbs 3:21-22</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>

        

        <p>
          <sup>21</sup> My son, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight, preserve sound judgment and discretion;
          <sup>22</sup> they will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck.
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Value of Wisdom and Discretion</b></p>

        <p> In Proverbs 3:21-22, we are reminded of the immense value of wisdom and discretion. The passage states, "My son, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight, preserve sound judgment and discretion; they will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck." These verses not only call us to treasure and uphold these qualities but also highlight the profound benefits they bring—life and a good reputation. <br><br>

        Wisdom and discretion are two indispensable attributes that guide us in living a purposeful and godly life. Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge in practical and righteous ways, ensuring that our decisions honor God and benefit others. Discretion, on the other hand, is the capacity for careful thought and sound judgment, enabling us to assess situations with precision and avoid rash decisions. <br><br>
        
        These qualities are not merely theoretical virtues; they have tangible benefits. Verse 22 describes them as bringing "life" and adorning one’s character like an "ornament to grace your neck." The life referred to here extends beyond mere existence; it is abundant and fulfilling, akin to the promise Jesus made in the Book of John, saying, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 10:10b ESV</b><br>
        I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. </i><br><br>
        
        This abundant life is dynamic and overflowing, as illustrated by Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well in the Book of John: <br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 4:13-14 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>13</sup> Jesus replied, “Anyone who drinks this water will soon become thirsty again. <sup>14</sup> But those who drink the water I give will never be thirsty again. It becomes a fresh, bubbling spring within them, giving them eternal life.”</i><br><br>

        He offered her living water that would quench her deepest thirst and well up into eternal life—a vibrant and transformative gift.<br><br>
        
        When wisdom and discretion adorn our lives, they become like a beautiful necklace, drawing admiration and respect from those around us. A life marked by these virtues reflects the grace and power of God, inspiring others and serving as a testimony of His work within us. Just as a spring of water bubbles with energy and vitality, the Christian life, guided by wisdom and discretion, is not stagnant but active, constantly influencing and blessing others.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 3:21-22 serves as a call to prioritize wisdom and discretion as treasures that shape our character and our journey. By preserving sound judgment and making decisions with care, we experience the fullness of life that Jesus offers and reflect His light to the world. These virtues are not only a source of personal growth but also a testimony to the transforming power of God’s wisdom in our lives. Let us, therefore, strive to keep them ever before us, allowing them to guide our paths and bring glory to God.
