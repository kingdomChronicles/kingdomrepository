        </center>


        <p class="SCQoute">As members of the Kingdom of God, we are called to seek and immerse ourselves in the divine wisdom that flows directly from Him. As we delve into the historical background and uncover the mysteries behind God's Program, it is crucial that we depend on His wisdom to truly understand His words and the depth of His writings.</p>

        <h2>Proverbs 4:24</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p><sup>24</sup> "Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you."</p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b></b></p> -->

        <p> As Jesus pointed out in Luke, there is a close connection between what is in the heart and what comes out of the mouth. <br><br>

        <i><b>Luke 6:45 AMP</b><br>
        The [intrinsically] good man produces what is good and honorable and moral out of the good treasure [stored] in his heart; and the [intrinsically] evil man produces what is wicked and depraved out of the evil [in his heart]; for his mouth speaks from the overflow of his heart. A Secure Foundation</i><br><br>
        
        After urging his son to guard his heart, Solomon tells him to put crooked speech and devious talk far from him. The term translated "crooked" here is the same as used in Proverbs: <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 2:15 ESV</b><br>
        men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.</i><br><br>
        
        It carries the idea of someone who speaks in a manipulative or immoral manner. The same basic idea is repeated here, with a condemnation of speech which is "off-color," either in intent or in form.<br><br>
        
        Corrupt and foul talk betray an evil heart. Christians are commanded to put aside falsehood, angry words, corrupt talk, bitter words, slander, malice, and obscene talk. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Colossians 3:8 ESV</b><br>
        But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. </i><br><br>
        
        <i><b>Ephesians 4:25-31 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>25</sup> Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. <sup>26</sup> Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, <sup>27</sup> and give no opportunity to the devil. <sup>28</sup> Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need. <sup>29</sup> Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear. <sup>30</sup> And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. <sup>31</sup> Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. <br><br>
        
        <b>James 3:6, 9-10 NLT</b><br>
        <sup>6</sup> And among all the parts of the body, the tongue is a flame of fire. It is a whole world of wickedness, corrupting your entire body. It can set your whole life on fire, for it is set on fire by hell itself.
        <sup>9</sup> Sometimes it praises our Lord and Father, and sometimes it curses those who have been made in the image of God. <sup>10</sup> And so blessing and cursing come pouring out of the same mouth. Surely, my brothers and sisters, this is not right! </i><br><br>
        
        The apostle James writes about the power of the tongue and says it is "set on fire by hell", and he points out the incongruity of using the tongue to bless and curse. <br><br>
        
        A person may argue that words are just words, and therefore there is nothing wrong with any particular term or combination of syllables. However, that reasoning does not stand up to the indictment Scripture levels against corrupt and foul speech. Whether one feels the physical sounds matter or not, the intent of the heart matters a great dealâ€”making it clear that controlling one's tongue is more than a mere suggestion.<br><br>
        
        We must remember that our words have the power to build up or destroy. As followers of Christ, we are called to speak with holiness, truth, and love. Pure speech is not merely an outward display but evidence of a heart transformed by God. By guarding our words, we reflect the holiness of our God and become witnesses of His grace in our lives.
