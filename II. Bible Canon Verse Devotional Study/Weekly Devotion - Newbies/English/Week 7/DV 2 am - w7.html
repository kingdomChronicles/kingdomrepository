      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>Isaiah 53:9, 12</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
                <p> 
                  <sup>9</sup> He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth. 
                  <sup>12</sup> Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, <u>and was numbered with the transgressors</u>. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
                </p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><i>As we continue our devotional series on the 700-year prophecy about the coming Messiah from the book of Isaiah, we reflect on a profound verse that sheds light on Jesus' demeanor and purpose. </i><br><br>

                    Once again, we witness the profound accuracy and detail in the prophecies surrounding the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Jesus was crucified alongside criminals, fulfilling the prophecy that He would be "numbered with the transgressors" (Isaiah 53:12). As the Gospel accounts detail, one criminal was crucified on His right and the other on His left. Typically, those who were executed were buried in common graves, a fate likely intended by Jesus' executioners.<br><br>

                    However, this did not come to pass. Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy man who had purchased a fine tomb likely intended for his own use, intervened. He went to Pilate, the Roman governor, and asked for Jesus’ body. Pilate granted his request, and Joseph laid Jesus in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out of rock. This act is detailed in the Gospel of Matthew:<br><br>
                    
                   <i>"Matthew 27:57-60 (NIV): <br>
                    As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away."</i><br><br>
                    
                    The significance of Jesus being placed in this tomb cannot be overstated. Had Jesus been buried in a common grave, the subsequent verification of His resurrection would have been far more challenging, if not impossible. The private tomb provided clear and crucial evidence of His resurrection that a mass grave could not have offered. The tomb's distinct location made it easy to identify, seal, and guard, ensuring that when Jesus rose, there was undeniable proof that the tomb was empty.<br><br>
                    
                    The act of Jesus being laid in a new tomb also fulfilled the prophecy found in Isaiah 53:9, which states, "He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth." Jesus, innocent of all charges and without sin, was treated with honor in His burial, contrasting with the typical fate of executed criminals.<br><br>
                    
                    The guarded and sealed tomb provided by Joseph of Arimathea played a pivotal role in affirming the truth of Jesus' resurrection. The fact that the tomb was verifiably empty was crucial for the early Christian testimony and for the faith of countless believers throughout history. It stands as a testament to the precise fulfillment of prophecy and the divine orchestration of events surrounding Jesus' death and resurrection.<br><br>
                    
                    Furthermore, the resurrection itself is the cornerstone of Christian faith. Jesus' rising from the dead validated His identity as the Son of God and His mission to bring salvation to humanity. It confirmed His victory over sin and death, offering hope and eternal life to all who believe in Him.<br><br>
                    
                    In conclusion, the detailed fulfillment of prophecy in Jesus' burial and resurrection underscores the sovereignty of God and the reliability of scripture. Joseph of Arimathea's act of placing Jesus in his own tomb provided the necessary conditions for the undeniable proof of the resurrection. This event continues to be a central element of Christian faith, emphasizing that Jesus was innocent of all charges, died for the sins of humanity, and rose again, securing the promise of eternal life for all who follow Him.</p>
