          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
          <h2>Romans 3:23</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
          <p><sup>23</sup> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</p>


          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

          <p>The message is simple and clear: Everyone sins. There is no difference. All have sinnedâ€”both Gentiles and Hebrews, male and female, and no matter what job you have, from street sweeping to preaching the Word of God, you sin. Everyone has sinned. No one is without sin. There is no escaping this fact. Paul only has one category: "sinner," and everyone falls into it. The most moral people and the most wicked people are all the same in this: "We are all sinners."</p> 

          <p>Even worse, knowing right from wrong, and even the law given by God to Moses, doesn't make us moral or sinless. The Greek word translated as "fall short" is in the present tense, meaning we keep on falling short and keep on sinning. In other words, knowing the consequences of our sins isn't enough to stop us from sinning.</p>     
          
          <p>What is worse is that many people we know not only sin but also enjoy doing sinful things against our Creator. Even the most polite person we know, if we could look into their heart, would also be shown to be a sinner.</p>

          <p>Because none of us are sinless, we all fall short of God's glory. This matters because we cannot be saved from God's judgment against our sin unless we are sinless. That is God's standard, and we all fall short of His "glory" because of our sins. God's glory, or the glory of Himself and His kingdom, is shared with those who are in His family, His children. However, our sin keeps us from sharing in His glory.</p>

          <p>That's why we are encouraged to meditate on His Word continually, so we can understand God's way of being saved and becoming acceptable in His eyes.</p>
