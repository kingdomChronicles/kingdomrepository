                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>

                <h2>Psalm 1:1-2</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
                <p><sup>1</sup><b>Blessed is the man</b> who <b>walks not</b> in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; <sup>2</sup>but <b>his delight</b> is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he <b>meditates day and night</b>.</p>

               
                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>



                <p>In these verses, the Psalmist states the contrasts of the destructive “way of sinners” with the successful “way of the righteous”.</p> 

                <p>A difficult truth to accept is that the unsaved and unrighteous often struggle to read and understand the Word, whereas the righteous find joy and delight in His Words. According to the psalmist, happiness, joy, and success come to those “whose delight is in the law of the Lord”.</p>


                <p>The original Hebrew term translated as “delight” conveys "a feeling of extreme pleasure, satisfaction, or joy." For the righteous, finding pleasure and joy in reading, studying, and applying God’s truth to their lives is of greatest importance.</p>

                <p>A godly person's relationship with the Word of God should mirror being in love. Those who are in love find joy in each other's presence, desire to spend time together, and cherish every word exchanged. When they are apart, they yearn to be reunited. This serves as an illustration of how we should feel about God's Word.</p>

                <p>The righteous find joy in the law of the Lord by meditating on God’s Word <b>day</b> and <b>night</b>. We frequently consult it, allowing it to serve as a guiding light and roadmap for our journey. We take pleasure in God’s Word because we understand its ability to sustain us with joy during times of despair, to provide comfort, hope, protection, and victory over sin, and to securely lead us to our eternal home.</p>

                <p>Finding joy in the law of the Lord entails esteeming and treasuring God's Word as an invaluable treasure, more precious than "thousands of pieces of silver and gold." It is a constant companion and friend, the melody of our life's song, a source of sweet and fulfilling nourishment for the soul, a guiding light in times of darkness, heritage forever, the joy of the heart, and a source of life, sustenance, power, liberation, and wisdom.</p>

                <p>We find joy in the law of the Lord by integrating God's Word into our daily lives, eagerly receiving its message, regularly reading our Bibles, studying and exploring the Scriptures, allowing the Word to correct us and guide us towards righteousness, internalizing it to resist sin, placing our trust in it, and obeying its teachings.</p>

                <p>Our love for God is central to delighting in the law of the Lord, as God and His Word become our greatest passions in life: "Oh, how I love your instructions! I think about them all day long." God seeks to captivate our entire hearts with His Word. The image portrays a mutual joy and delight in our relationship with the Lord.</p>

                <p>God finds joy in His people by showering them with spiritual abundance and prosperity, likened to a tree planted by streams of water, bearing fruit in season and maintaining its vitality—prospering in all they do. In return, we delight in God by wholeheartedly loving Him and obeying His Word.</p>

                <p>In summary, the righteous individual does not "walk in the counsel of the wicked." This means that they do not heed the advice of the world but instead find joy in obeying God and His Word.</p>
