      <h2>Matthew 13:44</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
      <p> 
        <sup>44</sup> “The kingdom of heaven is like a [very precious] treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid again; then in his joy he goes and sells all he has and buys that field [securing the treasure for himself].

      <p><b>The Treasure Hidden in the Field</b></p>

     <p>What would a person feel if he accidentally stumbled upon a large volume of buried treasure? <br><br>

        We often imagine adventurers or explorers finding treasure, but sometimes, ordinary people discover it unexpectedly while going about their daily routines. They aren't even looking for treasure.<br><br>
        
        Occasionally, people do find buried treasure. Yet, even the greatest earthly treasure is nothing compared to the spiritual treasure found in Christ. The riches of Christ are worth far more than all the wealth in the world.<br><br>

        Why?<br><br>

        Everything in the world, along with all its possessions, will one day vanish, but the things of God will endure eternally. <br><br>
        
        In the New Testament times, there were no banks to keep treasures safe from the many armies passing through Judea and Samaria. People hid their valuables in the ground, hoping to retrieve them after wars ended. Sometimes, they were killed or deported, like during the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles, leaving their treasures behind. <br><br>
        
        The man in the parable of the hidden treasure was overjoyed by his discovery.
        It's possible the parable refers to a laborer who unearthed treasure while plowing a field. Realizing its value, he reburied it, deciding to buy the field. <br><br>
        
        Ancient rabbinical law stated the field's owner would legally own the found treasure. <br><br>
        
        The man could have stolen and sold it elsewhere but chose to sell all he had to buy the field legally.<br><br>
        
        What is the main point of the parable?<br><br>
        
        The Kingdom of Heaven is the treasure and Christ is it's most prescious portion. Some people aren't looking for it but stumble upon the truth of Christ hidden in the world. <br><br>
        
        Worldly people see no value in it; they only see the field, not the treasure beneath. Those who see little value in the Kingdom of Heaven view things only from a worldly perspective. To them, the things of God seem foolish.<br><br>
        
        But the called and chosen ones see great value in eternal matters and trade worldly things just to hold onto eternal treasures. <br><br>
        
        The apostle Paul said:<br><br>
        
        <i> "What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ."</i><br><br>
        
        A relationship with God cannot be bought. We can't buy righteousness and salvation with our efforts or resources. The emphasis here is on the value the man places on the treasure and his decision to acquire it at all cost.<br><br>
        
        When we buy something, we exchange one thing for another. Here, we exchange our broken lives for His eternal life. <br><br>
        
        As the prophet Isaiah said:<br><br>
        
       <i> “Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost.”</i><br><br>
        
        We give up something we have to obtain something we value more. We should see the value in selling all and focusing on the Lord Jesus to enter His Kingdom.<br><br>
        
        <i> "To all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ Himself, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."</i><br><br>
        
        Like the apostle Paul, the Lord wants us to let go of worldly things to gain Christ. The man in the parable sold everything to buy the field.<br><br>
        
        One day, you must leave this world. If your focus is only on this world rather than the hidden treasure, what will your last words be? <br><br>
        
        Voltaire, the famous French Enlightenment philosopher, said just before he died, “In the name of God, please let me die in peace.” <br><br>
        
        Queen Elizabeth I of England said, “All my possessions for a moment of time only.” <br><br>
        
        We should live mindful of the life to come. The life on earth is but a shadow of the real life beyond. <br><br>
        
        God offers us His treasure if we receive Christ. Along with Him, we get everything.<br><br>
        
       <i> “He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?”.</i><br><br>
        
        Many who hear about a Savior will later regret not accepting the truth. This gospel is hidden in the world, but people plow their fields daily without caring about their eternal destination.<br><br>
        
        The man in the parable let go of other things to hold onto the treasure. We must consecrate ourselves to the Lord.<br><br>
        
       <i> “May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through.”</i><br><br>
        
        To consecrate means to fill our hands with God, letting go of worldly things. <br><br>
        
        Sometimes, we hold onto things so tightly that we can't receive what God offers.<br><br>
        
         Our hands can be full of possessions that actually possess us. <br><br>
        
        Even a christian church, denominations procaliming Christ and other religious systems with strict rules can keep us from Christ's truth. <br><br>
        
        Let go of anything that hinders you from grasping the eternal treasure. Open your hands so God can fill them.<br><br>
        
        How precious is God and His Eternal Kingdom to you? <br><br>
        
        What do you need to trade to gain Christ and enter His Kingdom? <br><br>
        
        Let go of your vices, mobile games, and trivial social media matters, as well as every worldly thing. <br><br>
        
        Let go of what robs your time from precious things, like the things of God. Let go of anything that hinders you from knowing God.<br><br>
        
        Let go of things that hinder you from serving God—everything should come after Christ. <br><br>
        
        He should be our top priority. <br><br>
        
        If we put God first, everything else will fall into its proper place.<br><br>
