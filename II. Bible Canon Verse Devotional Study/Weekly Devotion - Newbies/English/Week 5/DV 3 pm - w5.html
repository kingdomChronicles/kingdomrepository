      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>

      <h2>Colossians 1:4-5,9-14</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
      
      <p>           
        <sup>4</sup> since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints, 
        <sup>5</sup> because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel, <br><br>

        <sup>9</sup> And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, 
        <sup>10</sup> so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; 
        <sup>11</sup> being strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy; 
        <sup>12</sup> giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. 
        <sup>13</sup> He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, 
        <sup>14</sup> in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.  
      </p>

      <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

    <p><b><sup>4</sup> since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints,</b> <br><br>
    
        In this verse, the "we" Paul refers to includes his co-author, Timothy. Timothy was with Paul in Rome during his imprisonment. While Paul was under house arrest, Timothy assisted him by meeting his needs and acting as his writing collaborator.<br><br>

        In the Bible, the term "saints" doesn't mean people who are holier, purer, or more spiritual than others, nor does it mean the dead people some religions mention at the end of their prayers. Instead, it refers to everyone who has accepted the Gospel of Our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>
        
        Paul emphasized his acceptance of the Colossian Christians and held a high view of their faith as fellow saints in Christ. One of the obvious traits of the saints was their great love for one another, all of whom joyfully accepted the Good News.</p><br><br>

    <p><b><sup>5</sup> because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel,</b> <br><br>
    
    
        Paul and Timothy could continually give thanks to God because of "the hope laid up for you in heaven," which means the hope prepared for them in the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>

        The people Paul writes to have already heard and accepted the gospel, referring to their salvation and eternal life.<br><br>
        
        This verse also describes the gospel as "the word of the truth." In the New Testament, "gospel" refers to both the good news of Jesus Christ and the truths about Him. <br><br>
        
        The word "gospel" literally means "good news," which is an understatement of what this truth means for those who believe the Word of God. This applies to us today who have accepted the power of the Word of God in our lives.</p><br><br>


    <p><b><sup>9</sup> And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,</b> <br><br>
    
        This passage moves from Paul's thankfulness to a prayer for the Colossian believers. Paul mentions that he and Timothy have been praying constantly since they heard about the Colossian church. In 1 Thessalonians, Paul talks about praying without ceasing as part of God's will for all Christians, and here he presents it as part of his ministry for the Colossian believers. <br><br>

        Paul and Timothy's prayer includes asking for knowledge for the Colossian believers. The qualities Paul prays for are not only helpful but also part of becoming more like Christ. Jesus was known for His wisdom, and His followers are to walk in wisdom as well. The faith of the Colossian Christians was not based on worldly thinking but on the power of God. Paul also desires wisdom among believers.</p><br><br>

    <p><b><sup>10</sup> so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;</b><br><br>
    
        Here, Paul explains why he prays for their knowledge, wisdom, and understanding. <br><br>
        
        He gives four reasons:<br><br>

        <b>First,</b> Paul desires that their actions match their beliefs, a trait that false believers do not display.<br><br>
        
        <b>Second,</b> Paul wants these believers to be "fully pleasing" to the Lord. Pleasing God includes believing in Him and living a life that follows His teachings.<br><br>
        
        <b>Third,</b> Paul wants these believers to be effective, productive, and godly in their spiritual growth. The idea of bearing fruit implies maturity. Paul longed for all of his fellow believers to grow in maturity as part of their Christian walk.<br><br>
        
        <b>Fourth,</b> Paul wants the Colossians to continue to learn more about their faith and the God they serve.<br><br>
        
        Knowledge of God involves learning the truth of the gospel and of Scripture (the Word of God).<br><br>
        
        Growing in God's will includes learning how to practically apply our knowledge. This knowledge also includes understanding God's specific desires for our individual lives.<br><br>
        
        Paul emphasizes the importance of both general knowledge and knowledge of God's will in the life of a believer. He shows that these two areas of knowledge are clearly connected.</p><br><br>


        <p><b><sup>11</sup> being strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy;</b> <br><br>
        
        Paul continues his prayer for the Colossian Christians by asking that they be given additional power, specifically, the power of God.<br><br>

        Paul explains that believers have God's power in their lives.<br><br>
        
        <b>First,</b> God's power gives endurance, which is the ability to withstand hardship without failing. The Lord is the "God of endurance," a quality needed by all Christians.<br><br>
        
        <b>Second,</b> God's power gives patience. Patience is part of the fruit of the Spirit and is essential for Christian maturity.<br><br>
        
        <b>Third,</b> God's power gives joy. Joy is also part of the fruit of the Spirit and is one of the clearest differences between the life of a believer and an unbeliever.</p><br><br>


        <p><b><sup>12</sup> giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.</b><br><br>
        
        Paul makes it clear that God alone provides salvation. It is by His grace through faith in Christ.<br><br>

        The inheritance of the saints is eternity with the Lord in the Kingdom of heaven. Paul illustrates this concept clearly, speaking of "the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints."<br><br>
        
        Paul also mentions light, an important concept in Hebrew thinking. According to the Jewish people, all knowledge and goodness were symbolized by "light," while sin and ignorance were characterized by "darkness."</p><br><br>


        <p><b><sup>13</sup> He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,</b><br><br>
        
        God has rescued and redeemed believers. Paul refers to God's rescue of Christians from the power of sin and death. Darkness is contrasted with light, as mentioned in the previous verse. Just as light and darkness have nothing in common, and good and evil are opposed to each other, heaven and hell are opposites.<br><br>

        Paul also says that God has changed us from sinners controlled by sin into new people meant for the Kingdom of Heaven. This shows how God saves believers from the power of sin and its consequences. Christians aren't just saved from the punishment of sin; we are completely changed. This assurance is given to everyone included in the Kingdom of God.</p><br><br>

        <p><b><sup>14</sup> in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</b><br><br>
        
        This short verse concludes Paul's prayer for the Colossian Christians.<br><br>

        The phrase uses a Greek word meaning "delivered" or "translated."<br><br>
        
        God radically changes our status, completely removing the eternal penalty of sin from those who have faith in Christ.<br><br>
        
        This verse concludes that thought, with a reminder of what Jesus has done: He has provided redemption.<br><br>
        
        Redemption is a theme in both the Old and New Testaments, from the redemption of the Passover Lamb to the redemption of Christ on the cross.<br><br>
        
        Through His sacrifice, Jesus provided a way for us to be forgiven for our sin.</p><br><br>



        <p><b>Conclusion:</b> <br><br>

        Always remember "If there is no transformation, there is no surrender that takes place in your life." you still remain in darkness. <br><br>    
        
        But God has already rescued many of us from the domain of darkness, where we used to walk in uncertainty. It's a path where everyone is blind and unable to see the truth. It's a kingdom where we are bound by the power of Satan, enslaved by worldly things, and trapped in sin. It's a kingdom where we are led by the desires of our sinful nature.<br><br>

        But now, God has transferred us into the light of His kingdom, where the power of darkness has no control. In this kingdom, the light of God shines on all the lies that used to come from the kingdom of darkness.<br><br>
        
        We continue to walk in the direction illuminated by the truth of His kingdom. We keep walking and learning because the blinders have been removed from our eyes to see the light of the truth that God wants to impart to us. Truths that will bring us complete salvation. Truths that will bring us right into His Kingdom, to live together under the leadership of the King most powerful of all.<br><br>
        
        Let us all delve deeper into the truths of our God and the riches of the Kingdom of Heaven that await all of His children, the children of light.<br><br>
        
        Likewise, we are encouraged to pray for one another, to always include everyone who is learning the ways of the Kingdom of God in these Last Days.<br><br>
        
        Let us continually pray that God will increase the number of people saved and included in His Kingdom.<br><br>
        
        Let us continually pray that He will use us as instruments to expand His Kingdom in the lives of other people. To use us in our school, work, church, in our family, and to use us as His arms to reach people and bring them into the light of His Kingdom. Amen.</p><br><br>

        <p>The system represents the Kingdom of Darkness, which encompasses the worldly influences, values, and structures that are contrary to God's Kingdom. Those who depend on this system, including our families if they haven't yet embraced the Kingdom of God, remain susceptible to being used by the enemy against us. This susceptibility arises because they are still under the influence of the Kingdom of Darkness.<br><br>

        The red shirt girl symbolizes the various obstacles and distractions that impede our progress and focus on God's Kingdom. These hindrances can take many forms, such as temptations, negative influences, or even personal struggles that draw our attention away from our spiritual goals and the mission of expanding God's Kingdom.<br><br>
        
        Our mission is to liberate everyone from the grip of the Kingdom of Darkness and guide them into the Kingdom of God. This involves sharing the gospel or include them on the Daily Devotional Program, living out our faith as a testimony, and praying fervently for the transformation of those still under the enemy's influence. By doing so, we help them experience the freedom, truth, and purpose found in God's Kingdom, ultimately weakening the enemy's hold on their lives and strengthening the community of believers dedicated to God's work.</p>
