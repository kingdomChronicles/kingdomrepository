                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
                <h2>James 1:22-25</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
                <p>
                   <sup>22</sup> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. 
                   <sup>23</sup> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror 
                   <sup>24</sup> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. 
                   <sup>25</sup> But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.
                </p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><b>Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.</b> <br>
                    He said that we should not just listen to his words; it is very important that we follow all the instructions of the Lord. Let's not compare it to a restaurant menu where we only read the ones we like and skip the ones we don't like. All of the written scriptures are for us. All scriptures are given, for us to grow strong as we walk in this world. And no matter what we go through, we will surely succeed because we know that God is always with those who fear Him and obey His words.</p>

                <p><b>Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.
                </b> <br>
                This verse is a warning to all who want to come close to God. Let's not be like what is mentioned in this verse, that upon hearing his word, it will immediately be taken out. It will come to our right ear, and immediately it will leave our left ear. It is likened to us looking at ourselves in the mirror: while we look at our face, we are happy, and we fix and clean it if we see dirt on our face, but after we look at it, we immediately forget our appearance. It's like people who are happy when it's a day of worship; there are those who cry, especially if the praise songs and the preached word they hear are beautiful, but after the fellowship time, they immediately return to their old personality, the personality that disobeys God's will.</p>

                <p><b> But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.

                </b> <br>
                The verse says that whoever looks intently into the perfect law, there is an emphasis; it means the writer cares a lot about how important God's words are and how powerful they are if we live by them. It says, it will give us freedom and bless us. Read, meditate, and live by it continually so that we can continue to experience the very presence of God in our daily lives. So even in simple things, we can feel the hands of God, because that's how He values and loves people who trust, fear and obeys Him.</p>

            <p>Most of us who go to church or to a fellowship service seek and praise God through the ways of our religion or denomination. We are so complacent that what we are doing is already enough to get the approval of God for the type of worship we are giving Him. Sometimes we tend to compare ourselves with the people in the church. Oh, this brother is doing this thing and that sister is doing that thing, so it means I can also get saved even in doing what they are doing, even those sinful acts or practices that are not acceptable with what the Word of God is telling.  Or sometimes our worship is based only on what we are seeing inside a church or a group; we tend to imitate the norms of churchgoers but are not real worshippers of the living God. They just do their religious rituals and traditions without allowing God to change them.</p>

            <p>Wake UP!!! It's a big mistake. God is telling you now to listen only to His word and not to the words of the people around you. Review everything from the beginning of your Bible devotion program. Listen only to His word. If your spirit discerns that what you hear or what you are seeing is not in accordance with His Word, then go back to the Word of God and search for the truth. All of us can make mistakes; even a brother or sister in church and even pastors may sometimes commit mistakes too, because we are only humans. Do not listen to us or to anyone if what we are saying is against God's word.</p>

            <p>At this moment, you are now getting stronger with your walk through your daily devotion to His word if you carefully followed and studied your daily devotion program. Just continue to be anchored in Him. You've been with him yesterday, and I believe you heard him talk to you in a personal way if you have done it in the right way. Now you know what His heart is towards you. Don't walk away or separate from Him anymore, but rather let Him lead you in every step. Talk to Him always through prayer and reading His words. Walk with Him on a personal level. He wants to always hear your heart's words towards Him.</p>
