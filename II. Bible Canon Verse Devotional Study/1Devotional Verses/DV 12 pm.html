                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
                <h2>Deuteronomy 30:19-20</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle"> AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
                

                <p>       
                  <sup>19</sup> I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore, you shall choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants, 
                  <sup>20</sup> by loving the Lord your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding closely to Him; for He is your life [your good life, your abundant life, your fulfillment] and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the Lord promised (swore) to give to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
                </p>

                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><b><sup>19</sup> I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse;</b> <br><br>
                    
                In these most solemn words, Moses set the choice before Israel. They had to choose between life and death, blessing and cursing. <br><br>

                The same is true for us now; we are confronted with the choice. But the choice focuses first on “Will I obey God or not? ", but on “Will I trust in Jesus for my standing before God?” Jesus said, He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters. Jesus is still asking the question, Who do you say I am? and our choice in answering that question determines our eternal destiny. We have heard and studied His words. We have to decide either to pursue God's way or to stop our devotional journey. <br><br>

                Spiritually, both heaven and earth, and all of God's angels, are our witnesses and are waiting on our decision now, whether at this moment you choose life or death.</p> <br><br>


                <p><b>therefore, you shall choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants, <br>
                    <sup>20</sup> by loving the Lord your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding closely to Him; for He is your life [your good life, your abundant life, your fulfillment] and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the Lord promised (swore) to give to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”</b> <br><br> 
                    
                    At the same time, though the choice belonged to Israel, the choice also belongs to us now. God cared about what we chose. <br><br>
    
                    When Moses pleaded with Israel, crying out for life, we know he reflected the heart of God toward Israel. Jesus is also pleading with us now. God is so respectful of our own decisions; what He can do is show His gracious love towards us, but He cannot help us if we do not want to choose His ways. <br><br>
                
                    My child? Choose life because He cares for you so much. Don't waste the sacrifices of all the chosen people just to prepare you for this very hour. Don't waste the sacrifice of the Messiah, the Son of God, that He has laid for you on the cross. Don't waste the death of the apostles and the martyrs just to write and bring this testimony; don't waste the life, blood, and resources of the people behind this "Kingdom Ways Program" so that this last generation may know God's good and wondeful purpose for all His creation. <br><br>
                
                    How God glorified Himself through Israel was up to them, but it was obviously God's preference that He glorify Himself through an obedient, blessed Israel. <br><br>
                    
                    The same is true for us today: God wants to glorify Himself through our lives through an obedient child in our person. <br><br>
                
                    God is pleading with you right now. <br><br>
                
                    Choose life! That you may love the LORD your God: To love God this way, to really trust Him, is explained well in His words at this moment. <br><br>

                     To love and trust God means to obey His voice, for a child who really loves and trusts their father will obey him. It means to cling to Him, for if we really love and trust Him, we will be attached to Him. It means to regard Him as our life throughout the length of all our days, because if we love and trust Him, He is not just part of our lives; <br><br>
                     
                     <b>He is our life. Your will be done always Lord.</b></p> <br><br>
   

                  <p>Just skip the ads: Listen and Sing silently/loudly with the Lord then say your prayer to Him.</p>
