                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>

                <h2>Psalm 1:1-2</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
                <p><sup>1</sup><b>Blessed is the man</b> who <b>walks not</b> in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; <sup>2</sup>but <b>his delight</b> is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he <b>meditates day and night</b>.</p>

               
                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>In these verses, the Psalmist states the contrasts of the destructive “way of sinners” (verse 1) with the successful “way of the righteous” (verse 2).</p> 

                <p>According to the psalmist, happiness, joy, and success come to those “whose delight is in the law of the Lord”.</p>

                <p>The original Hebrew word translated as “delight” indicates “a feeling of extreme pleasure, satisfaction, or joy.” Reading, studying, and applying God’s truth to one’s life is the pleasure and joy of the righteous.</p>

                <p>A godly person’s relationship with the Word of God should be like being in love. People who are in love delight in each other. They want to spend time together. They drink in every word they speak to each other. When they are apart, they long to be in each other’s company. That is an illustration of how we should feel about God’s Word.</p>

                <p>Believers delight in the law of the Lord by meditating on God’s Word day and night. We consult it often, letting it become a guiding light and roadmap for our journey. We delight in God’s Word because we know it has the power to sustain us with joy through times of despair; to give comfort, hope, protection, and victory over sin; and to lead us securely to our eternal home.</p>

                <p>Delighting in the law of the Lord means honoring and cherishing God’s Word because it is an irreplaceable treasure more precious than “thousands of pieces of silver and gold”; an ever-present companion and friend; the theme of our song throughout life; sweet and satisfying nourishment for the soul; a light in the darkness; “my heritage forever” and “the joy of my heart”; and a life-giver, life-sustainer, powerful force, liberator, and teacher of wisdom.</p>

                <p>We delight in the law of the Lord by making God’s Word a daily part of our lives; by receiving its “message with great eagerness”; reading our Bibles; studying and searching “the Scriptures day after day”; letting the Word “correct us when we are wrong” and teach us “to do what is right”; hiding it in our hearts to keep us from sinning; trusting in it; and obeying it.</p>

                <p>Our Love towards God is at the core of delighting in the law of the Lord as God and His Word become what we are most passionate about in life: “Oh, how I love your instructions! I think about them all day long”. God desires to capture our whole hearts with His Word. The picture is one of mutual joy and pleasure in our relationship with the Lord.</p>

                <p>God delights over His people by blessing them with spiritual abundance and prosperity, “like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither—whatever they do prospers”. And we, in turn, delight in God by loving Him with all our hearts and doing what He says in His Word.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, the righteous person “walks not in the counsel of the wicked”. In other words, he does not follow the world’s advice but takes pleasure in obeying God and His Word.</p>
