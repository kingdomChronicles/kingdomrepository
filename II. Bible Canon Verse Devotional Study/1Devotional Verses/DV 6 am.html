                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
                <H2>1 John 3:4-6</H2>
                <p class="chapterTitle"> NIV (New International Version)</p>
                <p>
                    <sup>4</sup> 4 Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness. <sup>5</sup> But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin. <sup>6</sup> No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.
                </p>


                <br><hr>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>
                <p><b>4 Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.</b> <br>
                    Here, in verse 4, sin is defined as lawlessness. This highlights our intentional deviation from God's moral law and God's standard of righteousness. This definition emphasizes that sin is not merely a mistake but a conscious violation of God's divine order. <br><br>

                    Did you know that in the Old Testament, there was no offering for intentional sin? What God only forgives are the unintentional sins; thus, God teaches the Israelites the ritual so that God will forgive their unintentional sins. But those who sinned intentionally were given an immediate penalty according to the laws given by God to Moses. <br><br>

                    Understanding sin requires us to engage in continuous self-examination. It invites us to reflect on our actions and intentions to recognize where we may have deviated from God's righteous path.
                </p> <br>

                <p><b>5 But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin.
                </b> <br>
                In verse 5, this passage prompts us to see the sinless nature of Christ: that He was revealed to take away our sins because in Him there is no sin. This highlights the redemption purpose of why Christ became man, the only human with a sinless nature. This qualifies Him as the perfect sacrifice for our sins, he was a perfect offering to take away our sins. <br><br>

                If you are a true believer, this passage serves as a reminder of how deep the love and grace of our God are for all of us.                
                </p> <br>

                <p><b>6 No one who lives in Him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen Him or known Him.
                </b> <br>
             
                This is a big challenge to all who want to seriously follow God's direction: Whoever remains in Him doesn't continue sinning, and vice versa, whoever continually commits intentional sins doesn't really know Him, and there is no real encounter yet with Him. If we still have repetitive sins, we need to confess and repent to God to save us, because, in that present situation, we are still under the dominion of Satan, the god of this world. We must ask God to help us forgive all your unrighteousness, and repent sincerely so that you may walk according to His ways. <br><br>

                We must always strive to live with righteousness, holiness, and purity in our hearts. We must ask God to give us discernment so that all our actions reflect our intimate relationship with Him. Thus, let us all together continue to grow in our knowledge of our God, so that we may follow carefully all His instructions to successfully live a victorious life against all the schemes of the enemy (Satan). <br><br>

                A true believer abides in Him and obeys His words. We are called to live in righteousness and turn away from sinful lifestyles. Amen.
