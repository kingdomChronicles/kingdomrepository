          <h2>John 10:10</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle"> NIV (New International Version)</p>
          <p>
            <sup>10</sup> The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p><b>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy;</b> <br><br>
        
            Who is the thief, and what does it mean that the thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy?<br><br>

            The Greek word for "thief" in this verse means "one who steals." Figuratively, it also refers to false teachers. Anyone who claims there is a way to salvation other than Jesus is "stealing" the truth from people. Just like a thief secretly climbs over the wall instead of using the gate, false teachers try to bypass Jesus. Those, like the Pharisees, who add manmade rules for salvation are false teachers who "steal" people's ability to understand the true path to salvation. This kind of theft results in death and destruction, as Jesus said the thief’s plan is to "kill and destroy."<br><br>

            False teachers are thieves who may pretend to offer salvation, but their intentions are harmful. Jesus told some unbelievers, <i>"You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies." </i><br><br>

            These false teachers/thieves are carrying out Satan’s intentions. Instead of bringing life, they bring death. Instead of giving, they steal. Instead of building up, they destroy. Instead of leading people to salvation, they lead them to destruction.<br><br>

            Dealing with spiritual thieves is serious. Paul told the Galatians, "If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!" There is only one gospel, the message of Jesus' death and resurrection. Any other so-called gospel must be rejected and cursed.<br><br>

            We still have false teachers today. Peter wrote, <i>"There will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves. Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping."</i><br><br>

            Jesus compared hypocritical, tradition-bound religious leaders to thieves. The purpose of a thief, concerning the flock, is to wreak havoc; the thief causes chaos for his own selfish gain. Generally, in our modern era, the thief referred to by Jesus Christ here is anyone who causes physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional harm to humanity, carrying out the agenda of Satan.

        </p><br><br>

        <p><b>I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.</b> <br><br>
        
            If your understanding of "abundant" is only about fine dining, designer clothes, or a luxury car, then you are missing Jesus' point. Even if you include perfect health, the spouse of your dreams, and worldwide fame, you are still far from what Jesus means. His understanding of abundant life isn't about having your best life now.<br><br>

            It is not wrong to be wealthy, but Jesus promises blessings in this life for those who are willing to forsake everything to follow Him. These blessings include not only the necessities for living but also a wealth of relationships, though there may still be persecutions. He made it clear that true life is not measured by possessions: <i> "Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions."</i> In fact, possessions can be more dangerous than rewarding, as they can lead to covetousness if they prioritize material wealth over God.<br><br>

            What is more abundant than the life we know now? According to Jesus, it is eternal life, life without end, protected by the Savior Himself. This is one aspect of the abundant life Jesus offers: it lasts forever. But just as importantly, Jesus said the abundant life is one where we are known by Him and follow Him.<br><br>

            The "abundant" life means something far more meaningful than material wealth and prosperity. It begins with salvation from the eternal suffering of the penalty of sin. An abundant life is, first and foremost, eternal life. It means gaining a heavenly perspective, leading to growing trust and knowledge of God. It means blossoming into a life full of the fruit of the Spirit. In other words, abundant life is about eternal life, which from now on is felt as a complete life towards the eternal kingdom of God.

        </p><br><br>

        <p><b>Conclusion:</b> <br><br>
        
            False teachers and false religions offer only shallow and temporary comfort, ultimately leading to destruction or eternal death. In contrast, Jesus offers a truly abundant life, making Him the greatest blessing you can ever receive. When we have the Lord Jesus, the temporary gains or losses of worldly possessions become insignificant compared to the eternal life that awaits those who follow Him, which is far better than the present. For those who trust in Jesus, the best is yet to come, promising everlasting life and spiritual abundance with the Great King and Lord of the Kingdom of God.<br><br>

            We are blessed that in these Last Days, the knowledge about the Kingdom of God and the salvation He offers are now directly shared with people, and God Himself provides understanding to all who seek Him in Spirit and truth through His Holy Spirit.<br><br>

            So let us continue to study His Word because we have God with us to guide and teach us in all truth.
