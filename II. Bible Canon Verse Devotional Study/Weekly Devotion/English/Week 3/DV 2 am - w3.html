          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
          <h2>Romans 6:23</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
          <p>
            <sup>23</sup> For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
          </p>

           


          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p>
          Paul sums up this section of his letter and the entire Gospel in one famous verse. He compares two types of lives: those without Christ are slaves to sin. Their sinful actions lead to death, meaning eternal separation from God. Regardless of how good someone may think they are, their actions can never be enough, and ultimately, they are responsible for sinning against God. <br><br>
          
          However, there's another option. Paul describes the opportunity to become servants of righteousness. This isn't something we can achieve on our own. As we've learned from previous verses, everyone has sinned and falls short of God's glory. Eternal life is a gift; it can't be earned by humans.<br><br>
          
          We are instructed to study God's Word to understand this free gift of Eternal Life. This is the solution He provided for humanity's lost condition. <br><br>
          
          Due to the prevalence of numerous deceitful teachers and false teachings being spread around us. We need to keep studying God's Word. <br><br>
          
          We are also encouraged to set aside what we've learned from our religions and let God teach us through His words. <br><br>
          
          Why?<br><br>
          
          A slight misunderstanding on God's solution, meaning what God has done for us, our soul is at stake. The outcome of that mistake will result us to sin and will lead us to spend eternity in Hell. We must pay close attention to the state of our soul after life. Because there will be no second chance to repent once we reach God's judgment. <br><br>
          
          If you believe you've attained the Eternal Life offered by God but continue on sinning or defying His will, maybe it's important to engage in self-reflection. Does my religion teaches the accurate understanding of God's Word? Or does my lifestyle and the way I understand God's truth is questionable? In either scenario, it is imperative to ensure that our understanding aligns with the truths about God. <br><br>
          
          Remember, religion cannot save us, only God can. Though those who became instruments of that wrong teaching or religion will face God's judgment for leading people astray and away from Him. Everyone who has been an instrument in leading people away from God or causing confusion about the truths of God will also face judgment before God. <br><br>
          
          So, if you are teaching anything about God, search your heart and make sure that only the complete truth of God's Word will come out of your mouth, because if you also become an instrument of confusion to people, you will also be accountable before God. <br><br>
          
          As the listener of those teachings, you are also responsible for what you hear. Remember, your own soul is still at stake here. <br><br>
          
          When was the last time you seriously studied God's Word? If you haven't done it yet, most of what you know about God might just be from what you've heard from people or religions that also use God's Word. <br><br>
          
          The Bible may seem like a simple book, but when you crack it open, you'll discover the immense truths and information it holds. Everything we need to understand about God and His plan for humanity is there, waiting for us to explore and study. Let God, through His Holy Spirit, be your guide so you can know all the truths in God's entire program. <br><br>
          
          We're encouraged to keep studying and reflecting on His Word until we finally understand and claim the free gift of God, the  eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.</p>
