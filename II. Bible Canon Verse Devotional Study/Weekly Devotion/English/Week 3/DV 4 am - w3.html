          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>
    
          <h2>2 Corinthians 11:14</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
                
                <p>
                    <sup>14</sup>And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.
                </p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

               <p>Paul has harshly exposed his opponents in Corinth for what they truly were: deceivers pretending to be genuine apostles of Christ. They were attempting to lead the Corinthians away from true devotion to Jesus by preaching a different gospel about a different Jesus and a different spirit. In essence, they were twisting all the true teachings Paul had given the Corinthians to gain some advantage for themselves.<br><br>

                Scripture suggests this tactic is not surprising. Satan also disguises himself as an angel of light. The Devil's greatest weapon has always been deception. The most effective deception is making people believe that what is evil is actually good, and what is dark is actually light. By wrapping lies in a veneer of truth, it becomes easier to deceive people into accepting falsehoods. Paul had already compared the actions of these false apostles to Satan's deception of Eve in the Garden of Eden.<br><br>
                
                Darkness and light are metaphors for evil and good. Seeing an angel of light naturally seems to indicate goodness, as the association of evil with darkness and good with light is a powerful archetype in human history. In the Bible, light is a spiritual metaphor for truth and God’s unchanging nature. It is repeatedly used to illustrate that God is wholly good and truthful. When we are “in the light,” we are with Him. He calls us to join Him in the light, as giving us light was His purpose. Light is where love resides and thrives. God has created light, dwells in the light, and places light in human hearts so that we can see, know Him, and understand the truth.<br><br>
                
                Therefore, when this verse tells us that “Satan disguises himself as an angel of light,” it means that Satan exploits our love of light to deceive us. He wants us to believe that he is good, truthful, loving, and powerful – all the things that God is. To portray himself as a dark, devilish being with horns would not be appealing to most people. Most people are drawn to light, not darkness. Hence, Satan appears as a being of light to attract us to himself and his lies.<br><br>
                
                Satan presents sin as something attractive and desirable, and he portrays false teachings as enlightening and transformative. Millions follow his deceptions simply because they do not know God’s truth. Isaiah describes the darkness that results from ignoring God's Word. The people of Israel sought truth by consulting mediums, deceived by Satan’s lies. Isaiah says, <i>“To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn. They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry. And when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will speak contemptuously against their king and their God, and turn their faces upward. And they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish. And they will be thrust into thick darkness.”</i><br><br>
                
                Darkness is a result of trying to find truth without the Word of God. Sadly, as Isaiah says, when people do not have the “dawn,” meaning the Word of God, they wander in darkness and often become angry at God, refusing to come to Him for help. This is why Satan’s masquerade as an angel of light is so effective. It turns white into black and black into white, leading people to believe that God is the liar and the source of darkness. <br><br>
                
                In straightforward terms, refusing to study and follow God's Word in daily living, while believing they are in the truth, puts them under the influence of Satan and the false beliefs they adhere to.
                </p><br><br>

                <p><b>How can we discern which light is of God and which light is of Satan? </b> <br><br>

                Our minds and hearts can easily be confused by conflicting messages. How can we ensure we are on the right path? The book of Psalms says, <i>“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path,”</i> and <i>“The unfolding of your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple.”</i> The words of God have power. Just as God’s voice spoke physical light into existence, it can bring spiritual light into our hearts. Exposure to His voice – through His Word – will help us discern between the genuine light of God and counterfeit light.<br><br>

                In these "Last Days," there are numerous versions of beliefs about God. If the aim of these beliefs is to distort the truth found in God's Word, they are schemes of Satan designed to prevent people from discovering the light that comes from God's Word. Satan does not want people to open and study God's Word because he knows that the Holy Spirit is there to guide those who seek God with all their heart in finding the truth.<br><br>

                Therefore, we encourage everyone to personally study and meditate on His Words day and night, so that we can easily recognize the schemes and attacks of Satan in our lives and gain the right understanding, right knowledge and true worship of God.
