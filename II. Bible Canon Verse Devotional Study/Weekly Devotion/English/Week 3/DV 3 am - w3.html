          <h2>Mark 7:6-9</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
                
                <p>
                    <sup>6</sup> He replied, “Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: “These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
                    <sup>7</sup>  They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.' 
                    <sup>8</sup>  You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions.” 
                    <sup>9</sup> And he continued, “You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions! 
                </p>


                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

               <p>In this verse, Jesus is speaking to the religious leaders, the Pharisees and scribes, who were criticizing Him and His disciples. He addresses them discussing how they have elevated their traditions above God's word. The main issue here is the tendency to downplay God's word and prioritize our own thoughts and ways, even in religious practices. This is humbling, as Jesus quotes Isaiah: "These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me."<br><br>

                To relate this to modern practices, these thoughts apply to our current religious activities, especially Christian gatherings. We might think this warning was only for ancient religions that prioritized human traditions over God's commandments, but it also applies to Christian worship today. We often think we're excused because we don't engage in the same practices as other religions do, but we might still fall into the same trap. We claim to worship God, but often our worship is just a routine or a Sunday obligation only.<br><br>
                
                When we go to church or Christian fellowship, we may feel we've dedicated ourselves to God. However, God knows our hearts and sees if our worship is genuine or just lip service. Many times, our hearts are far from God because we prioritize material things over Him. Some people attend fellowship but are preoccupied with the time, eager to leave.<br><br>
                
                We should go to fellowship to encourage one another and be inspired by what God is doing in everyone's lives. The congregation is like a hospital where God heals those with spiritual wounds. We need to correct our faith through God's word.<br><br>
                
                It's painful to admit, but numerous church rules and traditions hinder God's work. Sometimes, human policies overshadow God's program, preventing His word from being shared effectively. We must follow God's leading, especially through the Holy Spirit, and not try to lead God. If our inherited beliefs or practices conflict with God's word, we should follow God's word instead. We learn this through daily reading of His word.<br><br>
                
                Let's not attend church just to fulfill a Sunday obligation. Instead, let's go to learn and grow in our faith and walk with God, carefully following His commands.<br><br>
                
                Every time we gather for worship, let's let God speak to us. We shouldn't impose our own religious practices on God but listen to His word. We need to offer our whole selves so He can transform us. Even good religious practices, if they conflict with God's word, should be set aside in favor of His word.</p>
