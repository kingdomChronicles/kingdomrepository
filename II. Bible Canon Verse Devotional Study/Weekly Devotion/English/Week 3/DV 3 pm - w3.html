          <h2>Galatians 1:6-9</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Livingn Translation)</p>
          <p> 
              <sup>6</sup> I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called you to himself through the loving mercy of Christ. You are following a different way that pretends to be the Good News 
              <sup>7</sup> but is not the Good News at all. You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ.
              <sup>8</sup> Let God's curse fall on anyone, including us or even an angel from heaven, who preaches a different kind of Good News than the one we preached to you. 
              <sup>9</sup> I say again what we have said before: If anyone preaches any other Good News than the one you welcomed, let that person be cursed

          <p><b><sup>6</sup> I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called you to himself through the loving mercy of Christ. You are following a different way that pretends to be the Good News</b> <br> <br>

        Paul began his letter with a clear and beautiful explanation of the gospel message, or the "good news," about Jesus. He explained that Jesus sacrificed His life to atone for human sins and was resurrected by God the Father. Scholars refer to this as "substitutionary atonement," meaning that Jesus took our place and bore the full penalty for our sins. Without this, we would be trapped and destined for death rather than being rescued from "this present evil age."
        <br> <br>

        Paul is frustrated, even angry, with his readers. He is "astonished" that they are so quickly turning away from the simple truth. Specifically, Paul writes that by accepting a different idea, a different "gospel," than the one he taught them, they are actually abandoning Christ Himself.
    </p> <br><br>

          <p><b><sup>7</sup> but is not the Good News at all. You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ. </b> <br> <br>

        This serves as a warning for us not to easily accept teachings, especially those that contradict what is written in the Word of God.<br><br>

        The verse warns about those who intentionally distort the truth about Christ. Today, these are people and religions that twist the truth found in the Word of God. Many religious sects, including some Christian denominations, use the scriptures but offer different interpretations. Some even forbid their followers from reading the scriptures, claiming they are the only ones authorized to interpret them. However, we have the Holy Spirit to guide us and teach us the whole truth. One of Satan's tactics is to use religions to keep people from seeing the light of God's Word. That is why our devotional program encourages us to read the Word day and night, meaning to continually read and meditate on His words. This helps us easily distinguish the truth from the twisted teachings of those influenced by Satan.
    </p> <br><br>

          <p><b><sup>8</sup> Let God's curse fall on anyone, including us or even an angel from heaven, who preaches a different kind of Good News than the one we preached to you. 
          </b> <br> <br>

          Paul now condemns anyone who teaches a version of the gospel of Jesus different from the one they heard from him. He emphasizes that this includes himself or even an angel from heaven. If "the gospel" is modified, adjusted, or changed by anyone for any reason, it is no longer the gospel. It is no longer the truth at all. <br> <br>

          In our present age, this serves as a warning, especially for those who teach the Word of God and those who are leaders and deacons of a congregation. We must fully understand that we are in a position to help people know the truth, not distort it with our own interpretations and man-made policies for serving the Lord. All of us must be accountable if we allow the enemy to use us to distort the truth of the gospel or teach policies that contradict it.
        </p> <br><br>


          <p><b><sup>9</sup> I say again what we have said before: If anyone preaches any other Good News than the one you welcomed, let that person be cursed</b> <br> <br>

        This verse reiterates Paul's words from the previous verse with even greater emphasis. In the New Testament, repetition is often used to highlight the importance of a point. Here, Paul wants to make sure his readers understand how serious this is.
        <br> <br>

        Paul, writing with the full authority of an apostle of Jesus Christ, states once more that anyone who preaches a distorted gospel—a message that is different in any way from the one they received from him in person—stands "accursed."
        <br> <br>

        The curse Paul speaks of involves eternal damnation. He implies that false teachers cannot show the way to salvation because they do not possess it themselves; they are condemned. Paul's letter will clarify why it is crucial not to believe anyone who presents an altered version of the simple, powerful gospel message of Jesus that Paul has shared with them.
    </p> <br><br>



          <p>
              <b>This is gospel:</b> <br><br>

              The term "gospel" comes from the Old English word "godspell," which means "good news." In the context of Christianity, the gospel refers to the good news about Jesus Christ. It encompasses the message of His life, death, and resurrection, which provides a way for humanity to be reconciled with God.<br><br>

           <i> Key components of the gospel message include:</i><br><br>

           <i> The Life of Jesus:</i> Jesus, the Son of God, lived a sinless life, teaching about the Kingdom of God and performing miracles.<br><br>

           <i> The Death of Jesus:</i> Jesus was crucified, and His death served as a sacrifice for the sins of humanity. This is often referred to as "substitutionary atonement," meaning Jesus took the place of sinners and bore the penalty for their sins.<br><br>

           <i> The Resurrection of Jesus:</i> Jesus rose from the dead on the third day after His crucifixion, demonstrating His victory over sin and death. This resurrection is central to the Christian faith as it assures believers of their own resurrection and eternal life.<br><br>

           <i> Salvation Through Faith:</i> The gospel message emphasizes that salvation is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ. It is not earned by human efforts but granted by God's grace.<br><br>

           <i> The Promise of Eternal Life:</i> Those who accept and believe in the gospel are promised eternal life with God. This involves a restored relationship with God and the hope of eternal life in His presence.<br><br>

            The gospel message is the foundation of Christian belief and is shared to bring others into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ.
          </p> <br><br>

          <p>Receiving and living the gospel leads to transformed lives, bringing people to salvation and eventually into God's Kingdom. However, if there is no evidence of salvation, such as a transformed or godly life, it suggests that you have received a distorted gospel. What you believe to be salvation is not salvation at all; you have been deceived by a false promise of salvation. According to the scriptures, anyone who truly receives Christ experiences a complete turnaround in their life. No one who genuinely accepts Him remains unchanged. If there is no evidence of a changed life, it indicates that there was no real repentance of sin, no gospel of truth being preached, and therefore, no true salvation.        </p>
