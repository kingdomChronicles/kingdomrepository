          <h2>2 Thessalonians 2:9-12</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
                
                <p>
                    <sup>9</sup> The coming of the [Antichrist, the lawless] one is through the activity of Satan, [attended] with great power [all kinds of counterfeit miracles] and [deceptive] signs and false wonders [all of them lies], 
                    <sup>10</sup> and by unlimited seduction to evil and with all the deception of wickedness for those who are perishing, because they did not welcome the love of the truth [of the gospel] so as to be saved [they were spiritually blind, and rejected the truth that would have saved them]. 
                    <sup>11</sup> Because of this God will send upon them a misleading influence, [an activity of error and deception] so they will believe the lie, 
                    <sup>12</sup> in order that all may be judged and condemned who did not believe the truth [about their sin, and the need for salvation through Christ], but instead took pleasure in unrighteousness. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>Read <u>2 Thessalonians 2:1-17</u> to better understand our study.</p><br><br>

               <p><b><sup>9</sup> The coming of the [Antichrist, the lawless] one is through the activity of Satan, [attended] with great power [all kinds of counterfeit miracles] and [deceptive] signs and false wonders [all of them lies],</b> <br><br>

                <i>Satan has a plan:</i><br>
                He is not sleeping or like a criminal on death row just waiting for his sentence. Instead, he is like a convicted felon who has escaped. God tracks Satan’s every move. Even though Satan thinks he will eventually be caught and punished, he tries to cause as much chaos and destruction as possible, arrogantly believing he might escape his deserved fate of being cast into the lake of fire in the final judgment.<br><br>

                <i>Satan is powerful:</i><br>
                 It is his power that will bring about the rise of the Antichrist and the one-world government he will control. The Antichrist and the false prophet will have the ability to perform supernatural feats. This shouldn’t be surprising. Satan is a supernatural being. He is a spirit and was one of the most magnificent creatures in God’s creation before his corruption and fall. If a single angel can kill all of Egypt’s firstborn or 185,000 men in the Assyrian army, imagine what Satan can do.<br><br>

                 <i>Satan will deceive people with false wonders:</i><br>
                 

                 Miracles are powerful tools. Jesus used miracles to demonstrate His power and encourage many to believe in Him. Satan is probably the world's greatest imitator. He knows that signs and miracles can persuade people, and he uses these as weapons to deceive. Many people will see the miracle and believe the lies he spreads in the world.<br><br>

                 We should not believe in someone or something just because of a miraculous sign. A dream, a vision, or a healing is not enough to guarantee that what is happening is the "Lord's work." because Satan is a copycat and will try to imitate the miracles done by God to deceive people who are unwilling to search for the truth found in the Word of God. How can we know if it is God's work? For the chosen people of God, the message being taught should always be examined and compared to the Word of God; if it does not align with the Word of God, it should be rejected. This does not mean that we will automatically reject miracles. God continues to work in the world and does wonderful things. But we must learn what John said in 1 John "test the spirits" and test it through the Word of God.
                 <br><br>

                <i>The man of lawlessness’ deception (anti-Christ):</i><br>  
                We've already discussed this in the previous paragraph. Satan's entire plan is focused on deception. We've also learned in the book of John that Satan is the father of lies. The truth is not important to him. He will use any means to deceive people into worshiping him instead of worshiping the true God. From the beginning of human history, Satan has twisted the truth and spread lies. Like the lie he told Eve. Nevertheless, throughout history, people continue to believe in Satan.
            </p><br><br>

            <p><b><sup>10</sup> and by unlimited seduction to evil and with all the deception of wickedness for those who are perishing, because they did not welcome the love of the truth [of the gospel] so as to be saved [they were spiritually blind, and rejected the truth that would have saved them].</b> <br><br>
            
                In this verse, we see that Satan's deception is limited to those who perish because they did not accept the love of the truth, in short they did not accept His Word, that should enlighten them if they have listen to. This means true believers will not fall for the Antichrist's lies, why, because they continually anchor themselves in the Word of God. All true believers must ask God for a discerning mind and passionately seek the truth in God's Word. We can train ourselves to be healthily skeptical and easily discern about what we hear if we are constantly reading the Word of God. This doesn't mean we automatically reject what others say, but it means we should carefully consider if it aligns with the Word of God. We should be especially cautious about believing people who are already influenced by Satan's worldview, including many in the media, Hollywood, or atheist teachers and scholars.

            </p><br><br>

            <p><b><sup>11</sup> Because of this God will send upon them a misleading influence, [an activity of error and deception] so they will believe the lie,</b><br><br>
            
                God will send upon them a spirit of delusion. Who will He send it to? He will send it to those who perish—meaning, to unbelievers. Who are the unbelievers? Those who never accepted the truth, nowadays we can easily identify them, those who will reject the Word of God. This verse identifies a specific subset of unbelievers such as those who rejected the gospel before the closing of the Kingdom of God doors, they are the ones who will be given a spirit of delusion because of their continued rejection of the truth proclaimed to them. Those who accepted the gospel and repented before God closes the door of the Kingdom are not subject to these.<br><br>

                It can be helpful to recall the story of Pharaoh in Egypt. In the early chapters of Exodus, God informed Moses that He would harden Pharaoh's heart to bring judgment upon the Egyptians. Throughout the narrative, we see Pharaoh repeatedly hardening his heart. Despite witnessing numerous plagues that devastated Egypt, Pharaoh remained obstinate. The Bible indicates that God hardened his heart. In essence, Pharaoh bore full responsibility for his actions. Due to the hardness of his heart, God allowed him to face punishment for oppressing the Israelites, His chosen people. This serves as a reminder of those who do not genuinely approach God but instead persist in rejecting His call to repent and draw near to Him.
                The appointed time will come when God's call to them will run out, and He will say, "Enough. You must now be punished."<br><br>

                This deluding influence during the tribulation will be very much like what happened to Pharaoh. In both cases, people willfully reject the Lord and His Word multiple times. Finally, after crossing an invisible line, God’s patience will run out, and He will decide to judge these people and ensure that it happens.

            </p><br><br>


            <p><b><sup>12</sup> in order that all may be judged and condemned who did not believe the truth [about their sin, and the need for salvation through Christ], but instead took pleasure in unrighteousness.</b> <br><br>

                Here we see one of the key reasons for the tribulation. During this period, God will pour out His judgment on all who do not believe the truth. Judgment may not be one of the most attractive teachings in the Bible, yet it is repeated over and over. God is willing to extend His grace to people, but His patience has limits. After squandering the chance God has given them to repent, people will finally be judged. Jesus Himself spoke about the futility of throwing pearls before swine. If people do not accept His gift, He will eventually stop offering it.<br><br>

                We can learn a fundamental difference between believers and unbelievers from this statement. Both believers and unbelievers will commit sin. However, unbelievers enjoy sinning. They revel and take pleasure in it. Believers, on the other hand, feel repulsed by sin. Through the Holy Spirit, they feel guilt and shame when they sin and strive to change and repent, most of the time, there is an advanced conviction that helps them avoid sin. If someone continues to sin and finds enjoyment in those sins while claiming to be a believer, they are merely professing believers and not true believers at all. In short, they belong too in the group of unbelievers.

            
            </p><br><br>

            <p><b>Conclusion:</b> <br><br>
              
                One important lesson from this passage is the power of God. At first glance, this may seem confusing. After all, we've learned about Satan's plans, schemes, and power. Where is God in all of this? In the earlier verses, it is shown that ultimately, it is God who allows Satan, the Antichrist, and the false prophet to be revealed. One can assume that Satan has tried to fulfill his plan many times in history, and God has stopped him. God will continue to thwart Satan's plans until the set appointed time. When is that time? Before Christ's return, God will allow the gospel to reach the end of the world and preach the Kingdom of God everywhere so that people may decide upon hearing these truths. <br><br>

                Even though we learn that Satan is powerful, he can only operate within the limits that God has set for him. These limitations prevent him from causing even greater chaos in the world. During the tribulation, many of these restrictions will be lifted, allowing him to commit many evil deeds. During the tribulation, God will use Satan to fulfill His purpose of bringing judgment and condemnation to those who rejected His Son.<br><br>

                God never engages in evil, but He does use evil people to accomplish His righteous and just plans, demonstrating His sovereignty.<br><br>


               <b><i>Today is the day of salvation:</i></b><br>
               <i>Do not commit intentional sin or continuously reject God's call, thinking that you will repent or follow God at a later time, or when you have finished experiencing all the evil deeds you still want to do, or when you think you are close to death. You do not know what will happen tomorrow. Of the thousands of promises of God written in the Bible, the only promise that one will live tomorrow is missing. If you do not want to be among those whom God will pour out His wrath on, take His call seriously and truly follow Him. No one can escape this punishment of God if you do not repent. Along with this, be diligent in sharing the gospel. Use this Devotional Study and share it with others. Pray for and encourage your friends and family to believe in the Lord before it's too late.</i>
