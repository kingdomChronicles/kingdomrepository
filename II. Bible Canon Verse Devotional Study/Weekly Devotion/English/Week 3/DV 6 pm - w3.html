          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
          <h2>Revelation 20:10-15</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
          <p> 
            <sup>10</sup> And the devil who had deceived them was hurled into the lake of fire and burning brimstone (sulfur), where the beast (Antichrist) and false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night, forever and ever.  
            <sup>11</sup> And I saw a great white throne and Him who was seated upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them [for this heaven and earth are passing away]. 
            <sup>12</sup> And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the Book of Life; and the dead were judged according to what they had done as written in the books [that is, everything done while on earth]. 
            <sup>13</sup> And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and death and Hades (the realm of the dead) surrendered the dead who were in them; and they were judged and sentenced, every one according to their deeds. 
            <sup>14</sup> Then death and Hades [the realm of the dead] were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire [the eternal separation from God]. 
            <sup>15</sup> And if anyone’s name was not found written in the Book of Life, he was hurled into the lake of fire. 
          </p>

          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

       <p><b><sup>10</sup> And the devil who had deceived them was hurled into the lake of fire and burning brimstone (sulfur), where the beast (Antichrist) and false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night, forever and ever.</b> <br><br>
    
        Jesus spoke in Matthew about the eternal lake of fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.<br><br>
    
       <i> Matthew 25:41 NIV <br>
       <sup>41</sup> “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. </i><br><br>

       The Devil's punishment is part of God's eternal plan, not something conceived after the Devil's final battle against God. The deceitful and scheming enemy of God and His people will find his eternal home in the lake of fire, where the Antichrist and the False Prophet have already been for a thousand years. Together, the Antichrist, the False Prophet, and the Devil will endure torment forever.<br><br>

     <i> Revelation 19:19-21 ESV<br>
        <sup>19</sup> And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army. 
        <sup>20</sup> And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. 
        <sup>21</sup> And the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.</i>
    </p><br><br>            

    <p><b><sup>11</sup> And I saw a great white throne and Him who was seated upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them [for this heaven and earth are passing away].</b> <br><br>
    
        That throne was surrounded by a rainbow, symbolizing mercy and eternal life. John sees a white throne here, representing the purity of the One who sits on it. Our Savior and Lord sits on this throne because it is the seat of judgment.<br><br>


       <i> Acts 17:31 AMP<br>
        <sup>31</sup> because He has set a day when He will judge the inhabited world in righteousness by a Man whom He has appointed and destined for that task, and He has provided credible proof to everyone by raising Him from the dead.”</i><br><br>


        This verse foretells a future time of judgment "by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead." This "man" is Jesus, whom God raised from the dead.<br><br>

        When the Judge sits on the great white throne, the earth and sky disappear. The judgment happens somewhere in space while the New Heaven and New Earth are being prepared for those who will live there forever. These are the people whose names are written in the Book of Life, who have lived righteously from the beginning of time until Christ's return.<br><br>

       <i>2 Peter 3:10-13 AMP<br>
        <sup>10</sup> But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will vanish with a [mighty and thunderous] roar, and the [material] elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and the works that are on it will be burned up. 
        <sup>11</sup> Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be [in the meantime] in holy behavior [that is, in a pattern of daily life that sets you apart as a believer] and in godliness [displaying profound reverence toward our awesome God], 
        <sup>12</sup> [while you earnestly] look for and await the coming of the day of God. For on this day the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the [material] elements will melt with intense heat! 
        <sup>13</sup> But in accordance with His promise we expectantly await new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.</i><br><br>

       <i>Revelation 21:1 AMP<br>
        <sup>1</sup> Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away (vanished), and there is no longer any sea.</i> <br><br>

        The events described here remind us that God is not only loving and merciful, but also holy, pure, and righteous. Every single sin, no matter its size or type, must be judged and punished—either through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ or an eternity in hell.<br><br>

       <i>John 3:16-21 NIV<br>
        <sup>16</sup> For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 
        <sup>17</sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 
        <sup>18</sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. 
        <sup>19</sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 
        <sup>20</sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. 
        <sup>21</sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God. </i>
    </p><br><br>


    <p><b><sup>12</sup> And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the Book of Life; and the dead were judged according to what they had done as written in the books [that is, everything done while on earth].</b> <br><br>
    
        Standing before the great white throne are the resurrected dead, where their bodies and souls are reunited once more.<br><br>
    
       <i>John 3:36 NIV<br>
        <sup>36</sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them.</i><br><br>

        These condemned individuals come from all walks of life, from the poorest to the most affluent. They are being judged by the Faithful and True Judge, who died to offer a way out from sin and eternal punishment. Those gathered at the great white throne rejected Jesus' redemptive work and His gracious invitation to believe in Him and have eternal life. Consequently, instead of being judged based on Christ's sacrificial work, they face judgment for their sins as recorded in the books that are opened. The records reveal their sins and their failure to repent.<br><br>

        Simultaneously, another book is opened—the book of life. The condemned are sentenced to eternal punishment because their names are not written in the book of life. The judgment "according to what they had done" may suggest varying degrees of punishment in hell, but the crucial factor in determining their fate is the absence of their name from the Lamb's book of life.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p><b><sup>13</sup> And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and death and Hades (the realm of the dead) surrendered the dead who were in them; and they were judged and sentenced, every one according to their deeds.</b> <br><br>

        According to this verse, the sea gives up the dead that were in it. The wicked who perished in the oceanic waters receive resurrected bodies to appear before the great white throne judgment. This includes those who died at sea, including those who perished under the second trumpet judgment and the second bowl judgment. Death and Hades also give up their dead. The bodies of all the wicked who died and went into conscious punishment are raised to appear before the great white throne. This verse reminds us that the state of a person's physical body after death does not determine their eternal destiny. God can resurrect a person regardless of whether their body was buried, cast into the sea, cremated, or mummified. All who died living in wickedness and rejecting God's call to repentance since the creation of the world will face the Lord as their judge.<br><br>

        Hades is a term often used for the abode of the dead in general and is sometimes specifically implied to be the realm of the wicked. In the Old Testament, it was called Sheol and was used in a general sense. This is different from "paradise" or "Abraham's Bosom," a separated "compartment" serving as the temporary waiting place for those who died having faith.<br><br>

       <i>Luke 16:19-31 NIV<br>
        <sup>19</sup> “There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. 
        <sup>20</sup> At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores 
        <sup>21</sup> and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. 
        <sup>22</sup> “The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried. 
        <sup>23</sup> In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 
        <sup>24</sup> So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’ 
        <sup>25</sup> “But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 
        <sup>26</sup> And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.’ 
        <sup>27</sup> “He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, 
        <sup>28</sup> for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’ 
        <sup>29</sup> “Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’ 
        <sup>30</sup> “ ‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’ 
        <sup>31</sup> “He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’ ”</i><br><br>

                8 Minutes Video Experience in Hades/Sheol
            </button></a>
            </div><br><br>

        </p>
        <p>


        If an 8-minute video is so disturbing, how much more unsettling it would be to be cast into the Lake of Fire for eternity. Sheol/Hades is a place that anticipates the future occupants of the Eternal Lake of Fire. If Sheol is unbearable to behold, how much more so the Lake of Fire? Do not fear those videos; instead, fear the One who can cast into them.<br><br>

        Neither Sheol nor Hades is the eternal dwelling place of any person; only the Lake of Fire is reserved for unbelievers. Once again, we understand that the wicked are judged according to their deeds. No one at the great white throne judgment can plead innocence because their record is written in the books.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p><b><sup>14</sup> Then death and Hades [the realm of the dead] were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire [the eternal separation from God]. 
        <sup>15</sup> And if anyone’s name was not found written in the Book of Life, he was hurled into the lake of fire.</b> <br><br>
    
        This marks the final and complete victory over sin. The judgment is finished, and now Death and Hades are thrown into the lake of fire. Throughout their lives, unbelievers follow the will of the Devil.<br><br>
    
       <i>Ephesians 2:1-3 NIV<br>
        <sup>1</sup> As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, 
        <sup>2</sup> in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. 
        <sup>3</sup> All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath.</i> <br><br>


        These verses remind Christians that before salvation, they were dead in trespasses and sins. Sin characterized their lives, and they followed Satan, the prince of the power of the air. They lived according to the sinful nature and were deserving of wrath.<br><br>

        Revelation 20:14-15 describes the lake of fire as "the second death." The first death is physical, where the soul is separated from the body, and the unbeliever remains separated from God. At the second death, the resurrected body is reunited with the soul, and both are eternally separated from God. At this point, all sin and evil have been judged and punished: either in hell or through the sacrificial blood of Christ.<br><br>

        This verse clearly states that only having one's name in the Lamb's book of life prevents them from being cast into the lake of fire. God keeps accurate records, and all who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior have their names written in the book of life.<br><br>


       <i>John 3:36 NIV<br>
        <sup>36</sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them. </i><br><br>

        The verse distinguishes between those who truly believe in the Son of God and those who claim to believe but do not obey Him. The former have eternal life, while the latter face the wrath of God. The key difference between spending eternity in heaven or in the lake of fire is whether the Son of God is truly present in one's life.
