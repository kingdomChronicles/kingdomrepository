          <h2>John 8:44</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
                
                <p>
                    <sup>44</sup>You are of your father the devil, and it is your will to practice the desires [which are characteristic] of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks what is natural to him, for he is a liar and the father of lies and half-truths. 
                </p>

                 

                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

               <p>This passage teaches that Satan is the "father of lies" because he was the first to lie, deceiving Eve in the Garden of Eden. Satan's lie led Eve to her death, followed by Adam, and ultimately, all of humanity. Lying is Satan's main weapon against God's children, using deceit to separate people from their heavenly Father. Common lies include "there is no God," "God doesn't care about you," "the Word of God cannot be trusted," and "doing good works alone will get you into heaven." Satan often masquerades as an angel of light, making his lies seem good and reasonable.<br><br>
                
                Satan's lies continue to spread through people, often using charismatic but foolish individuals to propagate falsehoods, including false religions, cults, and even some Christian sects. His success depends on people believing his lies, which range from "little white lies" to massive deceptions that mislead the world. In these Last Days, the systems running the world are based on lies that distract us from God's truth.<br><br>
                
                Regardless of the size of the lie, all lies come from the devil. The Bible warns that all liars "will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur," which is the second death. These warnings, though unpleasant, are better than ignorance of danger. The Bible faithfully warns sinners of the dangers of lying.<br><br>
                
                We are grateful that we have overcome Satan's deception that our daily devotion is unimportant. We must continue studying God's Word to avoid being misled by the devil's lies and systems that aim to separate us from God's truth. Let us keep praying and studying God's Word, asking Him to use us to guide those lost in the world's falsehoods, unknowingly serving Satan.
                </p>
