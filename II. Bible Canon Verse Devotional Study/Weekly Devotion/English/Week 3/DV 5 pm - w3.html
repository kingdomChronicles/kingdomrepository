          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
          <h2>Matthew 24:11-14</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          <p> 
            <sup>11</sup> And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. 
            <sup>12</sup> And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. 
            <sup>13</sup> But the one who endures to the end will be saved. 
            <sup>14</sup> And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. 
          </p>


          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

         <p>To gain a deeper understanding of our devotion, read <u>Matthew 24:1-14.</u></p><br><br>
         
         <p><b><sup>11</sup> And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.</b><br><br>
        
          In this passage, Jesus warns about the rise of false prophets who will successfully lead people away from the truth about Him.  False prophets are those who claim to speak for God or Christ but distort the truth. These deceivers might lend credibility to the false messiahs Jesus mentioned earlier. They will be persuasive, and following them will not involve the high costs associated with bearing the name of Jesus. People who wish to avoid the diligent process of journeying with God and those who are not committed to the full truth will be inclined to believe these false prophets.<br><br>

          The Last Days began with the death of Jesus and will conclude with His second coming. Jesus explains to His disciples the harsh realities they will face after He departs and before the end of the age when He returns. He has told them they will be hated for their association with Him, persecuted, and killed.<br><br>


          We are now in the final phase of the Last Days, where the establishment of God's political Kingdom on earth is imminent. During this period, many who appear to follow Jesus will fall away under pressure, and some will betray others. False prophets will arise, spreading errors and leading many away from the truth about Jesus.

        </p><br><br>

        <p><b><sup>12</sup> And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold.</b><br><br>

          Jesus warns that one consequence of this false teaching will be chaos: a rejection of goodness and morality. Those who follow the distorted messages of false prophets will abandon the truth, rebelling against virtue and submission to God. This self-serving lawlessness will ultimately lead to a loss of love. The imagery of love growing "cold" suggests a lifeless corpse, symbolizing humanity's decline in compassion as it strays further from Christ's teachings.<br><br>

          Consider the laws being passed by various governments today, which often make wrong seem right and right seem wrong. These laws contradict the morality taught by God's Word. This is part of Satan's agenda for his One World Government, where he will be followed by those who love to do evil and those excluded from God's Kingdom because they rejected His call to listen and obey the truth in His Word. It is not surprising that rejecting God's law correlates with a loss of love for God and others.
        </p><br><br>

        <p><b><sup>13</sup> But the one who endures to the end will be saved.</b><br><br>
        
          Jesus is responding to a question from His disciples. They have asked about the timing of God's judgment and the signs of the end of the age. He has explained that sometime after He leaves and before the end arrives, many who seem to follow Him will abandon their faith. Moral chaos will increase, and Christian love will seem to fade from the world.<br><br>

          There are several possible outcomes of this passage. Those who remain faithful to Christ until death will be resurrected to experience eternal salvation. Those who fall away will not be saved because they have rejected the truth. Upon hearing God's word, one must hold onto it until their last breath or until they enter God's Kingdom before it closes its doors, as lifelong faithfulness is a sign of true salvation. Those who enter God's Kingdom will continue to live in the millennial kingdom. However, those outside God's Kingdom will face the rule of the Antichrist and endure the Great Tribulation, which is God's wrath upon all who practice evil and reject the gift of salvation offered by His Son, Jesus Christ.
        </p><br><br>

        <p><b><sup>14</sup> And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. </b><br><br>
        
          Jesus has described challenging times for His followers after He leaves the earth. He has foretold an era of intense persecution, death, and hatred for anyone associated with His name, and many of Jesus' followers, including the apostles, experienced martyrdom.<br><br>

          Many who appear to be true believers will fall away due to the teachings of false prophets. Lawlessness will increase, and many will grow coldly unloving.<br><br>

          Despite the prevalence of lawlessness, evil, and lies, none of this will stop the proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom. The word "gospel" means "good news." The good news that Jesus has been preaching about the kingdom of heaven is that it is coming and will soon be here. He Himself is the King, and He will reign forever. This devotion is part of proclaiming the Kingdom of God, and when the preaching of the Kingdom of God is proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, then the end will come.<br><br>

          This is just a small part of the information we need to grow our knowledge of the Kingdom of God. That is why we are always encouraged to stay focused and not miss our daily devotion. You are just beginning to know God and His plan for humanity. You must always be anchored in God's truth and continue to learn the ways of the Kingdom of God to secure your eternal life in the presence of God.
