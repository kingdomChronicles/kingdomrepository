          <h2>Psalms 103:13</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Tranlation)</p>
          <p>
            <sup>13</sup> The LORD is like a father to his children, tender and compassionate to those who fear him.
          </p>


          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

          <p>God is the Father of all who fear Him. He is a compassionate father to His children. The word "compassion" comes from a Hebrew term that means taking action. It's an emotion that drives Him to help us. As a father, He sympathizes with us. He knows the consequences of sin and calls everyone to come to Him. He knows each of us and understands our current situation on earth. He is aware that the world is under the enemy's control, and we face constant attacks from Satan.</p>

          <p>From birth, we inherit a condition that makes us unworthy of His presence because of the effect of the sin of Adam and Eve. We are born with a sense of deficiency and a deep longing. Many people today seek answers to this feeling of incompleteness. Some try to fill it with worldly possessions, relationships, or harmful habits, but the emptiness remains. Why does the sadness in our lives persist? People sense that something is missing. Some think marriage will bring happiness, yet many married people are unhappy. Others believe achieving their dreams will fulfill them, but even those who reach the pinnacle of success often still feel incomplete.</p>

          <p>Indeed, something is missing in our lives. God, our Father, is the source of life. Just as fish need water and trees need soil, we need God to truly live. Without Him, we are like walking dead. We must stay connected to God, our Father, to experience true life.</p>

          <p>In Isaiah, the people cry out to God, calling Him their Father. They say, "You, LORD, are our Father; we are the clay, and You are our potter; we are all the work of Your hands." God is our Father.</p>

          <p>Jesus referred to God as "Our Father," showing that God is a person we can relate to and love. He wants to be close to us and have a personal relationship with us. Jesus came to introduce God the Father to humanity. He was despised and crucified to restore our relationship with Him.</p>

          <p>As the verse says, If we approach God with fear and humility, we can call Him our Father.
            <br><br></p>

            <p><b>Reminder:</b></p>
            <p> 
            For your evening devotion, can you dedicate ample time to meet with God personally? If so, here are some steps to prepare before you start your evening devotion. <br><br>

            1. Find a quiet, secluded place where you won't be disturbed for the entire duration of your devotion, from beginning to end. If you have headphones, get them ready to help you focus. If you don't have headphones, try to borrow a pair. <br><br>

            2. Approach this time with an expectant heart, believing that God the Father will meet you personally this evening. If you are truly committed to meeting with God, after your prayer, you will feel an extraordinary sensationâ€”a profound joy that comes from reconnecting with your Creator. <br><br>

            3. Write down your reflections now, and share with the group how joyful you are to meet with God, your Father, this evening. You will understand why He is called by these titles: <br><br>

            A Father to the Nation of Israel, Righteous Father, Abba Father, Everlasting Father, Father of Glory, The Living Father, Father of Lights, Father of Mercies, Father of Spirits, Father of the Fatherless, and your personal Father.
