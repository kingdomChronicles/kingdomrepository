      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>Ezekiel 8:1-4</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
      <p> 
        <sup>1</sup> Then on September 17, during the sixth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity, while the leaders of Judah were in my home, the Sovereign Lord took hold of me. 
        <sup>2</sup> I saw a figure that appeared to be a man. From what appeared to be his waist down, he looked like a burning flame. From the waist up he looked like gleaming amber. 
        <sup>3</sup> He reached out what seemed to be a hand and took me by the hair. Then the Spirit lifted me up into the sky and transported me to Jerusalem in a vision from God. I was taken to the north gate of the inner courtyard of the Temple, where there is a large idol that has made the Lord very jealous. 
        <sup>4</sup> Suddenly, the glory of the God of Israel was there, just as I had seen it before in the valley.

      <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

      <p><b>I. Ezekiels Vision</b><br><br>

        The elders had to witness the judgment they had failed to prevent. The Lord transported Ezekiel from Babylon to Jerusalem in a vision so he could report to all the leaders of Judah who sought his counsel in his home. There, he immediately saw some terrible examples of the people's idolatry. He saw a detestable idol at the entrance of the temple—an image that provoked the Lord to jealousy.<br><br>

        <b>II. The Abominations taking Place in the Court of the Temple</b><br><br>

        <b><i>1. The Image of jealousy</i></b><br><br>

        Ezekiel 8:5 <br>
        <sup>5</sup> Then the Lord said to me, “Son of man, look toward the north.” So I looked, and there to the north, beside the entrance to the gate near the altar, stood the idol that had made the Lord so jealous.<br><br>

        <b><i>2. Great Abominations</i></b><br><br>

        Ezekiel 8:6-8 <br>
        <sup>6</sup>“Son of man,” he said, “do you see what they are doing? Do you see the detestable sins the people of Israel are committing to drive me from my Temple? But come, and you will see even more detestable sins than these!” 
        <sup>7</sup>Then he brought me to the door of the Temple courtyard, where I could see a hole in the wall. 
        <sup>8</sup>He said to me, “Now, son of man, dig into the wall.” So I dug into the wall and found a hidden doorway.<br><br>

        <b><i>3. Greater Abominations</i></b><br><br>

        Ezekiel 8:9-12 <br>
        <sup>9</sup>“Go in,” he said, “and see the wicked and detestable sins they are committing in there!” 
        <sup>10</sup> So I went in and saw the walls covered with engravings of all kinds of crawling animals and detestable creatures. I also saw the various idols worshiped by the people of Israel. 
        <sup>11</sup> Seventy leaders of Israel were standing there with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan in the center. Each of them held an incense burner, from which a cloud of incense rose above their heads. 
        <sup>12</sup> Then the Lord said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the leaders of Israel are doing with their idols in dark rooms? They are saying, ‘The Lord doesn’t see us; he has deserted our land!’”<br><br>

        <b><i>4. Woman Weeping for Tammuz</i></b><br><br>

        Ezekiel 8:13-14 <br>
        <sup>13</sup> Then the Lord added, “Come, and I will show you even more detestable sins than these!” 
        <sup>14</sup> He brought me to the north gate of the Lord’s Temple, and some women were sitting there, weeping for the god Tammuz.<br><br>

        The mention of Tammuz in Ezekiel highlights the prophet's critique of idolatry. Ezekiel’s vision reveals the extent to which the Israelites had strayed from monotheistic worship, adopting practices that were contrary to their religious laws and traditions.<br><br>

        <b>III. The Abominations taking Place in the Inner Court of the Temple</b><br><br>

        Ezekiel 8:15-16 <br>
        <sup>15</sup> “Have you seen this?” he asked. “But I will show you even more detestable sins than these!” 
        <sup>16</sup> Then he brought me into the inner courtyard of the Lord’s Temple. At the entrance to the sanctuary, between the entry room and the bronze altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs to the sanctuary of the Lord. They were facing east, bowing low to the ground, worshiping the sun!<br><br>

        <b>Conclusion:</b><br><br>

        
        Despite the many warnings given to the ancient God’s people about the consequences of straying from His will, the Ancient Chosen People still chose to follow a path of abominations.<br><br>

        The elders who sought Ezekiel's counsel were appointed by God to teach repentance and guide the people back to Him. However, they failed in their duty, allowing the people to continue engaging in detestable practices.<br><br>

        Today, those of us who know the truth are like those elders, entrusted by God with the knowledge of the blessings and curses that a nation can face.<br><br>

        Will we remain silent, or will we act to become lights in our nation, sharing these truths with others through the Kingdom of God program?
