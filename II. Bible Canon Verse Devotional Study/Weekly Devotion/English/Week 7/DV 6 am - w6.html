      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>Isaiah 53:4-6</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
      
      <p>           
        <sup>4</sup> But [in fact] He has borne our griefs, And He has carried our sorrows and pains; Yet we [ignorantly] assumed that He was stricken, Struck down by God and degraded and humiliated [by Him]. 
        <sup>5</sup> But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was crushed for our wickedness [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing]; The punishment [required] for our well-being fell on Him, And by His stripes (wounds) we are healed. 
      </p>



      <br><hr>
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>


      <p>Verse 4 explains that people believed He deserved His punishment. <br><br>

        Verse 5 reveals that He was punished on our behalf. The concept of substitutionary atonement is conveyed in four key statements.<br><br>
        
        1. He was pierced for our transgressions.<br><br>
        
        2. He was crushed for our wickedness.<br><br>
        
        3. Upon him was the punishment that brought us peace.<br><br>
        
        4. By His wounds we are healed.<br><br>
        
        This passage emphasizes in four ways that He took our punishment. He paid the penalty for our sins. His suffering, His wounds, and His pain brought us peace and healed us. The context of this healing is spiritual, not physical; sin, not sickness, is addressed. He heals us from the effects of sin. Our relationship with Him, broken by the fall, can be restored.<br><br>
        
        Notice the detail in the words used.<br><br>
        
        <b>Pierced.</b> His feet and hands were pierced with nails.<br>
        <b>Crushed.</b> The weight the cross crushed Him and He couldn’t lift it. More than this, there was unseen weight of sin upon His shoulders.<br>
        <b>Wounds.</b> He had wounds from the whip, wounds from the nails, and a wound from the spear.<br><br>
        
        Remember, this was written long before these events occurred. The concept of substitutionary atonement was taught in the Old Testament long before Jesus came. Notice the detail in the words used.<br><br>
        
   
          <b>Application</b> – If you are willing to surrender completely to Him, turn away from your former sinful life, repent and believe the Gospel, and are ready to obey His will, you don't need to bear this burden alone. Jesus died in your place to remove this weight from you. Stop trying to carry it alone and give everything to Him now.<br><br><br>


          <i>
          Please Note:<br><br>

          Many of us came from wrong beliefs or perceptions, but we thank God for opening our eyes to the truth of His word.<br><br>

          The "Sinners Prayer" is claimed by many ministers of God to save people, where they say, "Lord Jesus, I repent of my sins. Come into my heart. I make you my Lord and my Savior."<br><br>

          However, our aim is to reveal the truth and enlighten you. This prayer misguides more people and leads them astray because it convinces them that saying a simple prayer saves them, even if they continue living against God's will, potentially leading them to eternal damnation or hell.<br><br>

          Scripture does not say that Jesus came to Israel and told them to receive Him into their hearts, saying the Kingdom of God is near.<br><br>

          Rather, He said, "Repent and believe the Gospel."<br><br>

          If you are not living according to God's will, then true repentance has not happened, and the promises of this devotional verse, such as substitutionary atonement, have not yet manifested in your life.<br><br>

          Truly repent before God now.
