      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

          <h2>Isaiah 53:10</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
                <p>
                  <sup>10</sup> Yet it was the LORD’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life an offering for sin, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand.
                </p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>As we continue our devotional series on the 700-year prophecy about the coming Messiah from the book of Isaiah, we reflect on a profound verse that sheds light on Jesus' demeanor and purpose.<br><br>

                <b>Satisfaction in Obeying God's Instruction</b><br><br>

                Our inherent sinful nature often leads us to place blame on others. Some may point fingers at the Pharisees or the Jewish leaders of Jesus' time. Historically, many have unjustly blamed the Jews for Jesus' death, missing two crucial points.<br><br>

                Firstly, it is our collective sin that placed Jesus on the cross. Each of us bears responsibility. Instead of searching for someone else to blame, we need to look inward. Our individual sins drove Jesus to sacrifice Himself.<br><br>

                Secondly, it was the "will of the Lord." Some translations even state, "It pleased God to bruise Him." This wasn't a mere accident or unfortunate event; it was part of God's sovereign plan established from the beginning of time.<br><br>

                Jesus offered His life as a ransom to cover the cost of sin. But to whom was this payment made? The reality is that this ransom was paid to God the Father. It was His wrath that needed to be satisfied.<br><br>

                On the eve of His death, Jesus prayed, "not my will, but yours be done." His crucifixion was in accordance with God's will. While God took no pleasure in the death of His Son, the sacrifice was holy and just. It was a perfect plan, and its fulfillment pleased God.<br><br>

                Those who believe that it is never God's will for people to suffer should reconsider this passage about the suffering servant. Sometimes, enduring trials is part of God's will, and He has a specific reason for allowing such experiences.<br><br>

                However, Jesus' death was not the end, and similarly, any suffering you face now is not the end for you either. Isaiah 53:10 states, "He shall see His offspring. He shall prolong His days."<br><br>

                Though Jesus was to die, He was also to live again. How can this be explained? Through the resurrection! He saw His spiritual offspring—believers worldwide who were adopted into the family of God because of Jesus' sacrifice.<br><br>

                In conclusion, satisfaction in obedience to God's will is paramount. Jesus' life, death, and resurrection demonstrate that suffering and trials can have a divine purpose. By following Jesus' example of obedience, we, too, can find satisfaction and purpose, knowing that our trials are part of God's greater plan. The resurrection offers hope and assurance that life triumphs over death, and that our obedience to God's will leads to eternal life and fulfillment in His kingdom.<br><br>

                As the establishment of God's Kingdom on earth in the Last Days approaches, God's reign will be realized through His chosen children.<br><br>

                The question is: Are you ready to obey God's instruction, embrace His divine purpose, and dedicate yourself to advancing His Kingdom on earth?<br><br>
                
                If your answer is <b>YES</b>, you want to be part of those advancing God's Kingdom.<br><br>
                
                In your reflection, include the phrase: <u>"Yes, I want to obey whatever God instructs me to do."</u> A separate meeting will be held for all who accept the challenge to serve God at a higher level in His Kingdom. This meeting will address various aspects of the work needed to continue expanding His Kingdom on earth.</p>
