          <h2>Isaiah 52:13-15</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
          <p>
            <sup>13</sup> Indeed, My Servant (the Messiah) will act wisely and prosper; He will be raised and lifted up and greatly exalted. 
            <sup>14</sup> Just as many were astonished and appalled at you, My people, So His appearance was marred more than any man And His form [marred] more than the sons of men. 
            <sup>15</sup> So He will sprinkle many nations [with His blood, providing salvation], Kings will shut their mouths because of Him; For what they had not been told they will see, And what they had not heard they will understand.
          </p>

          <h2>Isaiah 53:1-3</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
          <p>
            <sup>1</sup> Who has believed [confidently trusted in, relied on, and adhered to] our message [of salvation]? And to whom [if not us] has the arm and infinite power of the Lord been revealed? 
            <sup>2</sup> For He [the Servant of God] grew up before Him like a tender shoot (plant), And like a root out of dry ground; He has no stately form or majestic splendor That we would look at Him, Nor [handsome] appearance that we would be attracted to Him. 
            <sup>3</sup> He was despised and rejected by men, A Man of sorrows and pain and acquainted with grief; And like One from whom men hide their faces He was despised, and we did not appreciate His worth or esteem Him.

          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

          <p><b>Unveiling the Hidden Mystery of God's Saving Grace (Part 1/3)</b><br><br>

            Today, we will discuss the suffering servant. His resurrection is the reason we are here. Without it, there would be no church, no New Testament, no Christians, and no Kingdom of God on earth. We rejoice today because of everything He did for us. Our sins are washed away. His resurrection gives us hope that one day we too will rise. It fills us with joy.<br><br>
            
            But have we ever asked ourselves, how did Jesus accomplish this? How did He make this possible?<br><br>
            
            It wasn't free. Our salvation was bought at a great price. Before victory and celebration, Jesus endured unimaginable suffering due to the extreme hardship He experienced. He faced this so that all believers would no longer have to experience it.<br><br>
            
            Understanding the intensity of the suffering Jesus endured for us should deepen our gratitude and strengthen our desire to follow Him.<br><br>
            
            When you read Isaiah 52 and 53, it sounds like it’s describing Jesus, and that's because it is. Skeptics couldn't believe the prophecy could be so accurate, but the Dead Sea Scrolls, dated before Christ, contain an entire Isaiah scroll, including Isaiah 52 and 53. This shows that even unbelievers recognize it is talking about Christ. If you read this chapter to people somewhat familiar with the Bible, many would ask, “Where in the New Testament is that?”<br><br>
            
            Isaiah 52 and 53 is one of the most important passages in all of Scripture, often called "the heart of the Bible." It reveals God’s salvation plan and is both theologically rich and emotionally moving. It is even more powerful because it was written before Jesus came.<br><br>
            
            This prophecy was written 700 years before the Messiah was born. It’s significant because it not only identifies our Savior but also validates the truth of God's Word, which many people debate. Prophecies like Isaiah 52 and 53 prove the authenticity of the Bible.<br><br>
            
            Over the next three devotions this week, We hope your appreciation for Jesus and your awe for the Lord and His redemptive plan will grow. As verse 13 says, He will be "high and lifted up" in your heart. We hope your faith in God and the credibility of the Scriptures will be stronger than ever before.                 
            </p><br><br>

            <p><b>Chapter 52</b> <br><br>
                <b><sup>13</sup> Indeed, My Servant (the Messiah) will act wisely and prosper; He will be raised and lifted up and greatly exalted. </b><br><br>

                This passage is about the servant of the Lord. These statements are not surprising; you would expect the Messiah to be wise and exalted. Certainly, He was wise, skillfully handling all sorts of questions and attacks thrown at Him. However, after these initial statements, there is an immediate plot twist.<br><br>


                <b><sup>14</sup> Just as many were astonished and appalled at you, My people, So His appearance was marred more than any man And His form [marred] more than the sons of men. </b><br><br>

                Many were astonished. If you study the Gospels, you will find that people were often amazed by His words and actions.<br><br>

                Perhaps most astonishing is the suffering He endured. The passage gives a detailed description of the afflictions He faced.<br><br>

                His appearance was so marred that He was almost unrecognizable. A crown of thorns was pressed onto His head.<br><br>

                Jesus was beaten or whipped three times. The whip was designed to tear out flesh and bone. The severity was such that when Pilate presented Jesus to the crowd, he said, “Behold, the man.” Jesus' figure was so disfigured that many would not recognize Him. His human dignity was stripped away.<br><br>

               <i>John 19:5 ESV <br>
                <sup>5</sup> So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, “Behold the man!” </i><br><br>


                <b><sup>15</sup> So He will sprinkle many nations [with His blood, providing salvation], Kings will shut their mouths because of Him; For what they had not been told they will see, And what they had not heard they will understand. </b><br><br>

                Some Bible skeptics have claimed that Paul was the inventor of Christianity, suggesting he took Jesus and transformed Him into something else. They argue that the deep theological themes in Romans were Paul's inventions. But look at this: the concept of Christ’s atonement (and later we will see substitution and sacrifice) is right here in Isaiah. He "sprinkled many nations." The word for "sprinkle" is the same as in Leviticus, referring to the sacrificial rites.<br><br>


                <i>Leviticus 16:14 ESV <br>
                    <sup>14</sup> And he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the mercy seat on the east side, and in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times. </i><br><br>

                Jesus will sprinkle the nations with His blood. That’s another amazing concept: salvation is not just for the Jews. The Jewish Scriptures reveal that salvation is for all nations. Even kings around the world would hear about Jesus and His work.
                </p><br><br>

                <p><b>Chapter 53</b> <br><br>
                    <b><sup>1</sup> Who has believed [confidently trusted in, relied on, and adhered to] our message [of salvation]? And to whom [if not us] has the arm and infinite power of the Lord been revealed? </b><br><br>
    
                    There are two parts to the implication. First, what does God ask of us? Our part is to have faith and repent. His servant accomplished the required payment for sin; this was His mission, not ours. Our duty is to believe and genuinely repent.<br><br>

                As we study this passage, remember it was written long before Jesus ever came. God put it there ahead of time on purpose, making it plain to help people believe. Some say, “I won’t believe in God unless I see Him or give me a proof.”<br><br>
                
                But we who are called must respond with our faith.<br><br>

                    <b><sup>2</sup> For He [the Servant of God] grew up before Him like a tender shoot (plant), And like a root out of dry ground; He has no stately form or majestic splendor That we would look at Him, Nor [handsome] appearance that we would be attracted to Him. </b><br><br>

                Like a root out of dry ground—before the time of Christ, Israel had been without a prophet for a long time. It was a spiritually dry period in Israel's history. Jesus did not come from a noble family. He had humble beginnings, being laid in a manger as a baby. He did not come from a place where people expected prophets or important figures to arise. When people heard that He came from Nazareth, they despised Him. Even Nathanael asked, “Can anything good come from Nazareth?”<br><br>

                <i>John 1:46 ESV <br>
                    <sup>46</sup> Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.” </i><br><br>


                    <b><sup>3</sup> He was despised and rejected by men, A Man of sorrows and pain and acquainted with grief; And like One from whom men hide their faces He was despised, and we did not appreciate His worth or esteem Him. </b><br><br>

                    The Messiah was not going to be welcomed and celebrated. People would not line up to give Him awards. His road was a sorrowful one.<br><br>

                    Isaiah says that “we esteemed him not.” He writes in the first person, identifying himself as part of the nation of Israel. The nation as a whole did not believe in or respect Him.<br><br>
                    
                    He says that “we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.” The Jews who lived at the time of Jesus thought that He was being punished because of His own sins. They held a sham trial and declared Him guilty. He was crucified with criminals as one of them. Many even claimed that Jesus was working with the devil. They reasoned that if He was truly on God's side, God would not let Him suffer like that.<br><br>
                    
                    Rather than receiving the Messiah, they rejoiced at His suffering and believed it was well deserved. </p><br><br>

            <p><b>Conclusion:</b><br><br>

                Throughout history, the arrival of the Messiah was met with a mixture of anticipation, skepticism, and rejection. Many awaited a triumphant king who would liberate them from their earthly troubles, yet when He came, humble and meek, He was not welcomed by the majority. Despite this initial rejection, those who have come to know Him understand the profound blessings and grace He brought into the world. We are so grateful and blessed because He has opened our eyes to see the hidden spiritual mystery of God's saving grace.<br><br>

                The anticipation of the Messiah was deeply rooted in Old Testament prophecies. The Israelites dreamed of a savior who would establish a powerful kingdom and bring peace and prosperity. However, when Jesus came, His message and mission differed from the expectations of many. He taught about love, forgiveness, and a kingdom not of this world, but of the heart and spirit. This difference led to the rejection of Jesus by many, as they could not fully grasp His teachings, expecting a political savior to establish a political kingdom instead.<br><br>

                Despite this, those who embraced His message found themselves transformed. The teachings of Jesus, centered on love and grace, revealed a deeper spiritual truth. The concept of God's saving grace is one of the core tenets of Christianity. It is the understanding that salvation is a gift, freely given by God, not earned by human efforts. Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection unveiled this mystery, showing that God's love is unconditional and His grace is available to all.<br><br>

                Through His parables and teachings, Jesus opened the eyes of His followers to the hidden truths of the kingdom of God. He spoke of the mustard seed, the yeast, and the hidden treasure, all illustrating how the kingdom of God starts small and hidden but grows to encompass everything. This hidden mystery is now revealed to believers: God's grace is always present, working in the hearts of those who receive it, often unseen at first but eventually shining brightly.<br><br>

                This revelation of God's saving grace brings with it immense gratitude and blessing. To know that we are loved unconditionally and that our salvation does not rest on our own merits, but on God's grace, provides profound peace and assurance. It shifts our focus from striving to earn God's favor to living in response to His love. This understanding transforms lives, fostering a spirit of gratitude and humility.<br><br>

                In a world that often values achievements and status, the message of grace is revolutionary. It levels the playing field, showing that God's love and salvation are available to all, regardless of background or past mistakes. This revelation compels us to live lives of love and service, mirroring the grace we have received.<br><br>

                Although the Messiah was not welcomed by many, His coming and message changed the course of world history and the lives of those who accepted it. We are profoundly grateful and blessed because He opened our eyes to the hidden spiritual mystery of God's saving grace. This grace is a gift that transforms, empowers, and provides eternal hope, a treasure that beyond measure. </p>
