      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>Isaiah 53:11</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
                <p> 
                  <sup>11</sup> Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.
                </p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><i>As we continue our devotional series on the 700-year prophecy about the coming Messiah from the book of Isaiah, we reflect on a profound verse that sheds light on Jesus' demeanor and purpose. </i><br><br><br>

                <b>THE SATISFACTION OF A JOB WELL DONE</b><br><br>

                This verse offers a profound insight into the heart and mission of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. It speaks of His immense suffering and ultimate satisfaction in the work He accomplished.<br><br>

                <b>The Messiah’s Victory Through Suffering</b><br><br>

                The prophecy foretells the Messiah's victory, but not without immense suffering. Jesus endured the cross, experiencing physical agony, emotional distress, and spiritual anguish. However, Isaiah tells us that through this suffering, Jesus would see the results of His labor and be satisfied. This satisfaction is not a superficial feeling but a deep, profound fulfillment.<br><br>

                Jesus’ satisfaction comes from the fruits of His work – the salvation of countless souls. He did not face the cross with regret or bitterness. Instead, He saw beyond the pain to the eternal impact of His sacrifice. He redeemed sinners and brought them into right standing with God. This accomplishment brings Him immense satisfaction.<br><br>

                <b>Jesus’ Satisfaction in Our Salvation</b><br><br>

                Consider the significance of this satisfaction. Jesus looks at you, me, and every sinner He has redeemed and finds profound fulfillment. Your salvation is deeply satisfying to Jesus. He doesn't look back at the cross and think, "It wasn't worth it." Instead, He is content and fulfilled by the outcome of His sacrifice.<br><br>

                This concept can be likened to a mother giving birth. Pregnancy and labor are incredibly challenging and painful experiences. Yet, when a mother holds her newborn baby, all the pain and difficulty fade away. She feels a deep sense of satisfaction and joy, without any regrets. Similarly, Jesus endured the cross, despising its shame, because of the joy set before Him – the joy of seeing many accounted as righteous through His sacrifice.<br><br>

                <b>The Joy Set Before Him</b><br><br>

                The anticipation of the fruit of His labor motivated Jesus to endure the cross. Hebrews 12:2 echoes this sentiment: <i>"Looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God."</i> Jesus endured the cross because He knew the joy that lay ahead – the redemption of humanity and His exaltation to the right hand of God.<br><br>

                Jesus' motivation was the joy of bringing many sons and daughters to glory. His knowledge of the ultimate outcome – the salvation of believers – gave Him the strength to persevere through unimaginable suffering. The joy of fulfilling God’s redemptive plan and the satisfaction of seeing sinners reconciled to God were His driving forces.<br><br>

                <b>Application:</b><br><br>

                Reflecting on Isaiah 53:11 challenges us to consider our own lives. Do we find satisfaction in the work God has called us to do? Are we motivated by the eternal impact of our efforts? Jesus' example teaches us the importance of seeing beyond immediate suffering to the greater purpose God has for us.<br><br>

                In our trials and hardships, we can find encouragement in knowing that Jesus understands our pain. He endured the cross with a vision of the joy and satisfaction that would come. We, too, can endure difficulties with the hope of seeing the fruits of our labor. Our efforts and sacrifice in following Christ, sharing the gospel, and serving others are not in vain. They bring deep satisfaction to Jesus and contribute to His eternal kingdom.<br><br>

                <b>Conclusion:</b><br><br>

                Isaiah 53:11 reveals the heart of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. His immense suffering on the cross was not in vain; it brought Him deep satisfaction as He saw the fruits of His labor – the redemption of sinners. Jesus' example motivates us to endure our own trials with the vision of the joy and satisfaction that come from fulfilling God's purposes. As we reflect on His sacrifice, let us be inspired to persevere, knowing that our efforts bring eternal significance and satisfaction to our Savior.<br><br>

                <i>
                As the establishment of God's Kingdom on earth in the Last Days approaches, God's reign will be realized through His chosen children.<br><br>

                The question is: Are you ready to obey God's instruction, embrace His divine purpose, and dedicate yourself to advancing His Kingdom on earth?<br><br>
                
                If your answer is <b>YES</b>, you want to be part of those advancing God's Kingdom.<br><br>
                
                In your reflection, include the phrase: <u>"Yes, I want to obey whatever God instructs me to do."</u> A separate meeting will be held for all who accept the challenge to serve God at a higher level in His Kingdom. This meeting will address various aspects of the work needed to continue expanding His Kingdom on earth.</i></p>
