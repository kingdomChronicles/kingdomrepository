          <h2>John 14:27</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          <p>
            <sup>27</sup> “ Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.”
          </p>






          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p><b>Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you.</b> <br><br>

            This peace is not meant for everyone, only for those who are at peace with God.<br><br>

            How do we find peace with God? We find it through redemption. Redemption automatically puts us in a position of peace with God through Christ Jesus. Those who have fully repented of their sins, made God the ruler of their lives, and completely obey His words are the ones who are at peace with God.<br><br>

            This peace with God frees us from our past fears and torments, like the enemy's accusations and the Lake of Fire on the final judgment. It is often called the gift of peace from our Lord Jesus. This is why the Gospel of Christ is also known as the Gospel of Peace in the Bible.<br><br>

            The peace with God leads to the peace within, often referred to as the "peace of God." It is the heritage of believers who truly love God and obey His commandments. This peace calms us when troubles or anxieties seem overwhelming and reminds us that God is good and that He works all things together for our good.<br><br>

            "My Peace," as He mentioned, means a spiritual peace that He gives as a special gift to believers.<br><br>

            God will strengthen us during our troubles and personally give us His peace. It is peace of mind and heart.</p><br><br>

        <p><b>Not as the world gives do I give to you.</b> <br><br>
        
            Peace, as described by most people, is a state of mind free from anxieties, troubles, and worries that can confront us at any time in life.<br><br>

            The peace the world offers is the absence of war or conflict, a peace people experience when everything seems to be going well. The peace found in the world, the kind that a person can give, is temporary and lasts only until the next trouble arises. While, the peace of God does not depend on our circumstances.<br><br>

            The peace that Christ offers is not like the peace of the world. The best we can expect from the natural world is unfairness and death. Christ's "peace" refers to a hope and reassurance that goes beyond what a fallen world can offer. It is permanent, guaranteed, and eternal.
            </p><br><br>

        <p><b>Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.”</b> <br><br>
        
            Who else can give you true peace or restore peace to you except the source of peace? In Isaiah, Jesus is referred to as the "Prince of Peace."<br><br>

            God wants us not to worry and fear not, but to always depend on Him in all our circumstances. Trust Him in all situations, embrace His word and His promises. God is faithful and will always be with you.<br><br>
            
            The verse talks about God's kind of peace, a peace that remains forever regardless of situation. It quells every trouble even before it comes. Jesus referred to such peace in Philippians as the peace that surpasses all human understanding.<br><br>
            
            It is an inner peace that is evident, giving believers confidence that God is at work and reminding us of His divine presence. We will still face troubles because we are still in this world, but all troubles will be overshadowed by the peace of God, allowing us to overcome them all.<br><br>
            
            God assures us of the promise of eternal peace to all believers even in the midst of troubles. Peace is translated from the Hebrew word "Shalom," which is a common greeting among Jews. The word "Shalom" does not mean the absence of problems but a personal, inward, and lasting peace amidst troubles.<br><br>
            
            As Campbell Morgan described, this peace is “a heart untroubled and unfearful despite all the suffering and conflict ahead.”<br><br>
            
            The peace Jesus talks about is the inner peace or calmness in your heart despite troubles. It does not depend on your circumstances, nor does it eradicate worries or anxieties, but gives you the ability to endure with strong confidence that God will see you through.
            </p><br><br>

        <p><b>Conclusion:</b> <br><br>
        
            The world today is faced with turmoil and troubles. Everyone is seeking the peace of God.<br><br>

            Jesus is still in the business of giving peace today. Therefore, we should live a life of peace within ourselves. This peace doesn't just happen; it requires action on our part as believers. It requires a constant and close relationship with God.<br><br>
            
            How? Spend quality time with God in prayers and His word. An in-depth knowledge of God will enhance our relationship with Him, allowing us to enjoy His divine peace and find rest for our souls. Be passionate about God and obey His commandments as proof of our love for Him.<br><br>
            
            Finally, this verse speaks of the true peace of God for all believers who love and live for Christ. It serves as an assurance of eternal glory and the promise of being with Him in His Kingdom forevermore.
