          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
          <h2>2 Kings 6:8-17</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
          <p>
            <sup>8</sup> Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel. After conferring with his officers, he said, “I will set up my camp in such and such a place.” 
            <sup>9</sup> The man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there.” 
            <sup>10</sup> So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places. 
            <sup>11</sup> This enraged the king of Aram. He summoned his officers and demanded of them, “Tell me! Which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?” 
            <sup>12</sup> “None of us, my lord the king,” said one of his officers, “but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.” 
            <sup>13</sup> “Go, find out where he is,” the king ordered, “so I can send men and capture him.” The report came back: “He is in Dothan.” 
            <sup>14</sup> Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there. They went by night and surrounded the city. 
            <sup>15</sup> When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. “Oh no, my lord! What shall we do?” the servant asked. 
            <sup>16</sup> “Don’t be afraid,” the prophet answered. “Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” 
            <sup>17</sup> And Elisha prayed, “Open his eyes, Lord, so that he may see.” Then the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.

          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

          <p>Aram is at war with Israel, but the King of Israel always seems to predict Aram’s army movements. Every time Aram’s army makes a move, Israel is one step ahead. The King of Aram assumes there’s a spy in his camp, but in reality, God is speaking to the prophet Elisha, giving him divine knowledge and vision, which Elisha then shares with the King of Israel. <br><br>

            Realizing Elisha is the source of his problem, the King of Aram sends his army to capture him. One morning, Elisha’s servant opens the curtains and sees their house surrounded by Aram’s army. Panicked, he cries out, <br><br>
            
           <i> "We are doomed, sir! What shall we do?"</i><br><br>
            
            Instead of coming up with an escape plan or hiding, Elisha does something better. <br><br>
            
           <i>He says, "Don't be afraid," and prays, "O LORD, open his eyes and let him see!"</i> <br><br>
            
            God answers Elisha’s prayer, and the servant sees the hillside covered with horses and chariots of fire. God's protection becomes visible, and God rescues Elisha, his servant, and the entire nation of Israel. <br><br>
            
            What can we learn from this story? Let's focus on one line: <br><br>
            
           <i>“O LORD, open his eyes and let him see!”</i><br><br>
            
            This story highlights themes of blindness and sight. Elisha and Israel see as God sees, given divine knowledge and vision of Aram’s movements. However, Elisha’s servant is blind, seeing only as humans do, "faithless". Elisha has to pray for God to open his eyes.<br><br>
            
            This raises a question for us: Are we blind, or do we see as God sees? This theme runs through scripture. Jesus explains that many won’t grasp his parables because they are blinded to the truth. Paul writes in 2 Corinthians that, <i>“The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ...”</i> As Jesus died on the cross, he prayed, <i>“Father forgive them for they do not know [they do not see] what they are doing”</i> – Jesus saw God’s plan, but those who crucified him were blind to it.<br><br>
            
            But what about us? How do we see? Elisha’s servant was blind to three things – which we also can be blind to:
            </p><br><br>

            <p><b>1. God's Presence</b> <br><br>
            
           <i>"We need to have our eyes opened to God’s presence"</i><br><br>

            God is omnipresent – He’s everywhere – but that doesn’t mean we always see Him. Jesus says, “where two or three are gathered, there I am amongst them,” suggesting there are ways to encounter God’s presence more clearly. It's like adjusting a lens to bring God into focus; initially, we know He's there, but He's blurry, obscured by distractions. However, when we focus the lens, we see Him much more clearly.<br><br>

            One way to see and encounter God is through constant meditation on His Word. Another is through personal prayer and devotion, where moments of silence or specific scripture can bring God's peace and clarity. Additionally, seeking God's truth and meeting with others, whether in person or online, can help sharpen our focus on Him, as Proverbs says,<i> "As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another."</i> The key is to keep our focus on God every day, not just in special moments, to continually see His glorious vision, plans, and purposes, especially in expanding His Kingdom on earth.<br><br>

            This is why Hebrews tells us to <i> “fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith.”</i> When we focus on Him and all He has done for us, it’s much harder to get caught in sin; we see the bigger, better picture. Seeing God also gives us the courage to move forward into His will and plan. Throughout the Bible, figures like Moses, Samuel, David, and Isaiah gained boldness from seeing God. Moses, despite his fear, led the Israelites because he saw God in the burning bush and on Mount Sinai. Samuel grew into a great leader because he heard God in the Temple. David defeated Goliath because he knew God was with him. Isaiah responded to God's call because he saw God in the Temple. Seeing God allows us to move forward with boldness and courage, knowing we are not alone and do not work in our own strength.
            </p><br><br>

            <p><b>2. God’s protection:</b> <br><br>
            
            <i>"We need to have our eyes opened to God’s protection"</i><br><br>
    
            There's a small fish called Four Eyes that lives in Central and South America. What's unusual about this fish is its large, bulging eyes. The eyes are positioned in such a way that the fish can swim with the upper half of each eye above the water and the lower half below. The top half has a lens for seeing into the air, while the bottom half has a lens for underwater vision. This bifocal vision helps protect the fish from predators above and find food below.<br><br>

            This clever vision is similar to the perspective Christians should have. We need to focus on both the world around us and on God. While we may see problems below the surface, we can look up to see the One who protects us. The Psalmist says,<i> “The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and he delivers them.”</i> This protection was evident to Elisha’s servant, and Jesus mentioned it in the Garden of Gethsemane when He told Peter that He could call on twelve legions of angels for protection. Twelve legions number is 72,000 angels, highlighting the immense power God has to protect us. Remember the lesson of one angel who killed 185,000 soldiers; imagine the power of a legion of angels surrounding us. But for Jesus, He didn’t need that protection because it was God’s will for Him to go to the cross, but we often do need it. We need to recognize God’s angels around us, reminding us that God is on our side because we are on His side.                
            </p><br><br>

            <p><b>3. God’s provision</b> <br><br>
            
            <i>"We need to have our eyes opened to God’s provision"</i><br><br>
    
            In 2 Kings, we witness God's provision through His deliverance. Initially, God grants Elisha and the King divine knowledge of Aram’s movements, and later He provides for Elisha and His servant. This pattern of provision recurs throughout the Bible. We see God delivering the Hebrews from slavery in Egypt, David from Goliath, Daniel from the Lion’s Den, Peter and John from prison, and Paul from an angry mob, among other examples. Today, God has granted us ultimate deliverance through Jesus, saving us from sin, evil, darkness, and death. He will also deliver you in your present concern and continually provides and delivers in smaller ways in our daily lives. We just need to be sensitive to His actions. Often, we fail to see them because we take them for granted, but they are there. Let us begin to recognize them starting today.
            </p><br><br>


            <p><b>Conclusion:</b> <br><br>
            
        
            We should courageously speak the truth and prioritize God's ways and morals above everything else. Let us not resemble the hypocritical Christians of today, who appear holy on Sundays but live in a manner inconsistent with God's teachings for the rest of the week. This behavior often leads to a life consumed by fear and entangled in sinfulness.<br><br>

            For us, who are called to God's Kingdom, honoring God is our highest priority. By placing God above all else in our lives, we eliminate the need to fear anyone or anything else. We choose not to be controlled by fear any longer, as we are surrounded by vast, unseen protection. Let us not mimic those who profess Christianity yet live in fear. With God on our side, Satan's tactic is to deceive us, trying to trap us in fear and panic, convincing us that God will not intervene for us. <br><br>

            However, through the prophet Elisha, we are already aware of the reality of the unseen world. Let us proceed with confidence, knowing that our Heavenly Father's powerful hand is always upon us. Affirm this truth daily and open our eyes to be consistently reminded of God's presence, protection, and provision in our lives. Simply present everything before God through sincere and intimate conversation with our Heavenly Father, firmly believing that He always answers the prayers of His righteous servants. Why? Because the prayers of His righteous servants consistently align with the will of God.<br><br>

            This understanding helps us grasp our main purpose and why God invites us to join His Kingdom.  It guides us to discard unnecessary distractions and concentrate on our main goal:  to contribute to the advancement of God's Kingdom on earth.
