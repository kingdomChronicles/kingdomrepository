          <!-- <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p> -->
    
          <h2>Matthew 8:23-27</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">NASB1995 (New American Standard Bible 1995)</p>
          <p>
            <sup>23</sup> When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him. 
            <sup>24</sup> And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being covered with the waves; but Jesus Himself was asleep. 
            <sup>25</sup> And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, “Save us, Lord; we are perishing!” 
            <sup>26</sup> He said to them, “Why are you afraid, you men of little faith?” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became perfectly calm. 
            <sup>27</sup> The men were amazed, and said, “What kind of a man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”
          </p>



          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

     
          <p>These parallel accounts can also be found in <u>Mark 4:35-41</u> and <u>Luke 8:22-25</u>. Reading them will provide additional insights into the lesson.
        </p><br><br>

        <p><b><sup>23</sup> When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him.</b> <br><br>
        
            Recently, Jesus responded to the increasing crowds around Him. He directed His disciples to accompany Him by boat to the opposite side of the Sea of Galilee, which was comparable in size to a large lake. Jesus boarded the boat, followed by His disciples, and they began their journey across the water.<br><br>

            Though the exact number is uncertain, at least some of His disciples followed Him. The freshwater sea spans approximately 13 miles in length and 8 miles in width. The boats commonly used on the Sea of Galilee were relatively small. In 1986, a 2,000-year-old fishing boat was discovered in this region. This boat measured about 26 feet in length, or approximately 8 meters, and could accommodate 15 men. The boat that Jesus likely used to cross the sea was probably of a similar size and propelled by a sail. It is conceivable that this boat resembled the one utilized in this account.

        </p> <br><br>

        <p><b><sup>24</sup> And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being covered with the waves; but Jesus Himself was asleep.</b> <br><br>
        
            Jesus and His disciples are on a boat on the Sea of Galilee, a body of water known for its shallow depth and surrounded by steep hills that can lead to sudden, dangerous changes in weather. During their journey to the other side, a great storm arises suddenly, causing the sea to become turbulent and threatening. <br><br>

            Despite the intensity of the storm, Jesus is found fast asleep, indicating His likely exhaustion from previous activities such as preaching, healing, and dealing with crowds. The disciples, experienced fishermen familiar with the sea's unpredictability, are alarmed as the boat is swamped by the waves, a situation where water begins to pour over the sides. <br><br>

            The disciples' panic is heightened by Jesus' peaceful sleep, leading them to wake Him in fear for their lives. Jesus' ability to sleep through the storm showcases His unwavering faith in God's protection, even in the face of danger. <br><br>

            This incident highlights the disciples' struggle to fully grasp Jesus' divine nature and authority over nature. Despite witnessing His miracles and teachings, they are still overwhelmed by fear and doubt, questioning whether Jesus is aware of their situation.
        </p><br><br>

        <p><b><sup>25</sup> And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, “Save us, Lord; we are perishing!” </b> <br><br>

            The boat carrying Jesus and His disciples is beginning to "sink"—taking on water—amid a sudden and violent storm on the Sea of Galilee.<br><br>

            The disciples, some of whom were experienced fishermen who had faced storms before, were unable to bring the boat safely to shore and feared for their lives. Despite their expertise, they were alarmed at the waves pouring into the boat. This wasn't simply an irrational fear; there was real danger that the boat would sink and the passengers would drown.<br><br>

            They were certain that their end was near, and they couldn't understand how Jesus could sleep through such a situation. They wanted to wake Him up and have Him save them before it was too late.<br><br>

            Finally, the disciples woke Jesus and cried out to Him, fearing for their lives. With nowhere else to turn, they approached Jesus, woke Him, and said, "Save us, Lord; we are perishing!"<br><br>

            Matthew uses the Greek word typically translated as "save," which is "sozo" (G4982).<br><br>

            Whenever "sozo" is used, it is important to ask three questions:<br><br>

            What is being saved?<br>
            What is it being saved from?<br>
            What is it being saved to?<br><br>

            While it may seem obvious in this instance that the disciples were not asking Jesus to save their spirits from Hell to Heaven, whenever we encounter "sozo" or similar "salvation" passages, it is crucial to always use the context to answer these three questions to ensure accurate interpretation. If we assume every "sozo" means being saved from hell to heaven, we risk misreading the Bible.<br><br>

            In this case, what is being saved is the disciples' physical lives. What they are being saved from is physical death by drowning. What they are being saved to is more time to physically live on earth.
        </p><br><br>

        <p><b><sup>26</sup> He said to them, “Why are you afraid, you men of little faith?” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became perfectly calm.</b> <br><br>
        
            <i>He said to them, “Why are you afraid, you men of little faith?”</i><br>

            When Jesus wakes up, He doesn't immediately save them. Instead, He questions why they are afraid and criticizes their lack of faith.<br><br>

            He then labels them "oligopistoi," which means "little faiths." This rebuke serves as a wake-up call to the disciples, echoing His teachings in the Sermon on the Mount.<br><br>


            <i>“For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they? And who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life?”</i><br><br>


            Jesus's message appears to be that His disciples should have more faith in His ability to save them than fear of the storm. His main concern for those who follow Him is that they place their unwavering trust in Him. <br><br>

            <i>Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became perfectly calm.</i><br>

            After rebuking His disciples for their lack of faith, Jesus gets up and rebukes the winds and the sea.<br><br>

            Jesus had already shown His authority over human biology, disease, and demons, demonstrating mastery over the natural and supernatural realms.<br><br>

            Now, He reveals His dominion over nature itself, including the weather. By speaking directly to the elements, Jesus commands the wind, waves, and sea to be perfectly calm. The natural world obeys the voice of its Creator, highlighting Jesus's power over all creation.

        </p><br><br>

        <p><b><sup>27</sup> The men were amazed, and said, “What kind of a man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”</b> <br><br>

            The disciples, who had witnessed Jesus perform incredible miracles like healing lepers and casting out demons, were astounded. Throughout Jesus' ministry, they were continually amazed by Him.<br><br>

            Now, seeing Him calm a storm with just a word, they were even more amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this?" They were shocked to see even the forces of nature obeying Him.<br><br>

            Mark's account indicates that their amazement was tinged with fear. They realized that Jesus had power over the sea and the sky, which may have made them fearful of being in the presence of such immense power.<br><br>

            Their question reveals that the disciples had not fully understood Jesus' identity. They may have believed He was the Messiah with great power, destined to be king over Israel, but they had not yet grasped His true nature as the Son of God with all authority.<br><br>

            Matthew's gospel emphasizes that Jesus was not just a man with power; He was God Himself, the Creator of all things. He was the Messiah, the King of Heaven and Earth. Once again, Jesus' power and the implications of following Him inspired awe and fear in others.
        </p><br><br>

        <p><b>Conclusion:</b> <br><br>
        
            The storm on the Sea of Galilee and the miracle of Jesus calming it remind us of a deeper truth: in every storm of our lives, we are with the King of kings. He will not abandon us, and His power is greater than all our fears and worries. His call to us is to trust and have faith. Let us remember that true life is found in surrendering and trusting God, who holds everything in His hands.<br><br>

            Are you still doubting the King who calls you to follow and join His Kingdom? Don't be swayed by doubts and fears. Despite all the hardships and trials, His call is an invitation to eternal peace and joy. By responding to His call, you will become part of His chosen people, ready to serve and continue fulfilling His purposes. Remember, wholehearted surrender to God is the path to true life and salvation. Join Him now and accept His kingship.<br><br>

            Or maybe you still see this as just a worldly devotion to comply with the group you belong to. God's call is personal, so as long as you continue to harden your heart to His call, you will never enter His kingdom. Don't consider this devotion as just a requirement; it is a direct call to you. What God seeks is your wholehearted submission to His reign in your life. Don't wait for God to consider you part of the enemy's side, in the kingdom of darkness. Fear the King who calls you more than any problem that causes fear and doubt in you now.
