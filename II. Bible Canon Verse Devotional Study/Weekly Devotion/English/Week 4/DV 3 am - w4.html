          <h2>John 17:9</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
          <p>
            <sup>9</sup> I pray for them; I do not pray for the world, but for those You have given Me, because they belong to You;
          </p>

           

          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p>These words were spoken by Jesus before He and His disciples crossed into Gethsemane, where He would continue to pray before His arrest. What we now call the "High Priestly Prayer" began with references to the glory of God. <br><br>

        For three years, Christ had taught this small group of men. He had given them the Word of Life from heaven above. They received the Word of Truth and accepted Christ as the Word of God made flesh. They discovered Him as the Good Shepherd, the Water of Life, the Messiah of Israel, and the Living Bread that came down from heaven. They knew Him as the Resurrection and the Life, the Light in this dark world, and the Hope for a lost and dying race. <br><br>
        
        Jesus was about to transfer the enormous responsibility of spreading the gospel into their hands. They were to be His witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, and to the uttermost parts of the earth. In this final hour, Christ prayed on their behalf, asking that they be united in the truth they had received from Him and that God would keep each one from the wicked schemes of the evil one. This small group of men was very precious to the Savior, for the Father had given them to the Son, and they had received His word and understood that Jesus came forth from God and was sent by the Father. <br><br>
        
        The love of God for the world was so great that He sent His beloved Son to be the sin-sacrifice for all mankind. However, Christ's prayer was not for the world, but for the men who would represent Him to the world. Christ interceded for His chosen disciples, who would lay the foundation for the fledgling church and share the good news of the gospel of Christ to the Jews first and then to the Gentiles, reaching the uttermost parts of the earth. <br><br>
        
        Although Jesus' prayer was primarily directed towards the apostles, it has application to all who believe in Christ. One group not covered by this prayer consists of those who do not believe in the Son of God or, in our present time, those who do not believe in and follow the Truth written in the Word of God.<br><br>
        
        In conclusion, God's mighty hand, protection, and guidance are granted only to those who belong to His Kingdom or His chosen people. We can only experience God's mighty hand and the privilege of communion with Him through prayer if we are part of His chosenâ€”those who have accepted His rulership in their lives and dedicated themselves to advancing and expanding His Kingdom. <br><br>
        
        But, if your life is chaotic, it indicates that you have not yet become one of His chosen people and have not surrendered your life to God. Your prayers go unheard because your sins create a barrier between you and God. Thus, complete surrender is essential for anyone who wishes to become part of His chosen people in these last days. Amen.
