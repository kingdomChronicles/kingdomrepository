          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
          <h2>2 Kings 19:14-19</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          <p>
            <sup>14</sup> After Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it, he went up to the Lord’s Temple and spread it out before the Lord. 
            <sup>15</sup> And Hezekiah prayed this prayer before the Lord: “O Lord, God of Israel, you are enthroned between the mighty cherubim! You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You alone created the heavens and the earth. 
            <sup>16</sup> Bend down, O Lord, and listen! Open your eyes, O Lord, and see! Listen to Sennacherib’s words of defiance against the living God. 
            <sup>17</sup> “It is true, Lord, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all these nations. 
            <sup>18</sup> And they have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire and burned them. But of course the Assyrians could destroy them! They were not gods at all—only idols of wood and stone shaped by human hands. 
            <sup>19</sup> Now, O Lord our God, rescue us from his power; then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you alone, O Lord, are God.”
          </p>

          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

     
        <p>Letters can be wonderful, especially when they come from a loved one. Imagine receiving a letter from a son far away, fighting in a war, or from a parent who writes to say they’ve recovered from an illness. Perhaps a sister writes to share the joyous news of a new baby. However, there are also letters we dread, like those informing us of a loved one’s death. Then there’s the doctor’s letter predicting only a few months left to live, or the bank’s letter saying it’s time to repossess the house. These letters can feel like they’re sent from enemies. <br><br>

        The Bible tells of a time when King Hezekiah received a letter from Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, who was his greatest enemy. Sennacherib demanded total surrender, boasting of his military strength and pride. He even insulted God, comparing Him to the gods of the nations he had conquered. This was a dire situation for Hezekiah, made worse by receiving such letters from his enemy. <br><br>
        
        This story is taken from 2 Kings chapters 18-19. Reading these chapters first will give you a lot of important information and help you in your Bible reading training as you advance after your devotion lessons.<br><br>
        
        For this lesson, we will focus on the key verses to set the foundation for our devotional study.
        </p><br><br>

        <p><i>Chapter 18 Verses 5-7 <br>
            <sup>5</sup> Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before or after his time. 
            <sup>6</sup> He remained faithful to the Lord in everything, and he carefully obeyed all the commands the Lord had given Moses. 
            <sup>7</sup> So the Lord was with him, and Hezekiah was successful in everything he did. He revolted against the king of Assyria and refused to pay him tribute.
        </i></p> <br><br>

        <p>The stage is set: Hezekiah is a good king, a great king. In fact, the Bible tells us that among all the kings of Judah, no one was like him. He remained faithful to the Lord in everything he did.<br><br>

        Because of his faithfulness, God granted Hezekiah success in all his endeavors, including revolting against the king of Assyria.<br><br>
        
        To understand what's happening, let’s review a bit of history. After King Saul died, David became king, followed by his son Solomon. After Solomon, the kingdom of Israel split into two nations: ten of the twelve tribes kept the name 'Israel,' while the remaining two tribes became known as 'Judah.' While Judah had a few kings who followed God, none of Israel’s kings did. Despite many warnings from prophets, Israel persisted in its ways, and God eventually sent the Assyrians to conquer Israel. The Assyrians, a powerful empire by this time, wiped out the ten tribes of Israel. The remaining two tribes of Judah had to pay tribute to Assyria every year until Hezekiah decided to revolt and stop the payments.<br><br>
        
        King Sennacherib of Assyria did not take this lightly. He mobilized his army to attack Jerusalem. When Hezekiah realized Sennacherib was coming to destroy Jerusalem, he tried to make amends, offering to pay whatever tribute Sennacherib demanded if he would leave them alone.<br><br>
        
        Sennacherib demanded 11 tons of gold and silver. To meet this demand, Hezekiah stripped the gold and silver from his palace and the Temple and sent it to Sennacherib. But even after receiving the gold and silver, Sennacherib continued his advance on Jerusalem.<br><br>
        
        This brings us to verse 28, where Sennacherib’s army surrounds Jerusalem. His chief commander, or chief of staff (as the New Living Translation puts it), attempts to negotiate a surrender.
        </p><br><br>


        <p><i>Chapter 18 Verses 28-35 <br>
            <sup>28</sup> Then the chief of staff stood and shouted in Hebrew to the people on the wall, “Listen to this message from the great king of Assyria! 
            <sup>29</sup> This is what the king says: Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you. He will never be able to rescue you from my power. 
            <sup>30</sup> Don’t let him fool you into trusting in the Lord by saying, ‘The Lord will surely rescue us. This city will never fall into the hands of the Assyrian king!’ 
            <sup>31</sup> “Don’t listen to Hezekiah! These are the terms the king of Assyria is offering: Make peace with me—open the gates and come out. Then each of you can continue eating from your own grapevine and fig tree and drinking from your own well. 
            <sup>32</sup> Then I will arrange to take you to another land like this one—a land of grain and new wine, bread and vineyards, olive groves and honey. Choose life instead of death! “Don’t listen to Hezekiah when he tries to mislead you by saying, ‘The Lord will rescue us!’ 
            <sup>33</sup> Have the gods of any other nations ever saved their people from the king of Assyria? 
            <sup>34</sup> What happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad? And what about the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Did any god rescue Samaria from my power? 
            <sup>35</sup> What god of any nation has ever been able to save its people from my power? So what makes you think that the Lord can rescue Jerusalem from me?”
        </i></p> <br><br>

        
        <p>Now, imagine how frightened and discouraged the people must have felt after hearing this. But how do you think Hezekiah felt? Here he is, a good king who has been faithful to the Lord in everything, and now his city is under attack. He’s being discredited, ridiculed, and insulted. His God, whom he has faithfully served his whole life, is being mocked and made fun of, and there’s nothing Hezekiah can do about it. How would you feel if you were Hezekiah?<br><br>

        Maybe you have a pretty good idea. Perhaps you know what it’s like to be mocked because of your beliefs. Maybe you’ve experienced people discrediting or ridiculing you because you believe in God. Maybe you know what it’s like to be the odd one out because you go to church or Bible study or like this daily devotion that we do day and night.<br><br>
        
        If so, you can probably relate well with Hezekiah. What do you do when someone ridicules God right to your face? What do you do when they make fun of what you believe in?<br><br>
        
        Let’s see what Hezekiah did. Turn to the next chapter, 2 Kings 19, and we’ll find out what happens.
        </p><br><br>


        <p><i>Chapter 19 Verses 9-10 <br>
            <sup>9</sup> Soon afterward King Sennacherib received word that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was leading an army to fight against him. Before leaving to meet the attack, he sent messengers back to Hezekiah in Jerusalem with this message: 
            <sup>10</sup> “This message is for King Hezekiah of Judah. Don’t let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you with promises that Jerusalem will not be captured by the king of Assyria.
        </i></p> <br><br>

        <p>This is pretty much the same speech Sennacherib’s commander shouted to the people on the walls of Jerusalem. But now, look at what Hezekiah does next.
        </p><br><br>


        <p><i>Chapter 19 Verses 14-19 <br>
            <sup>14</sup> After Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it, he went up to the Lord’s Temple and spread it out before the Lord. 
            <sup>15</sup> And Hezekiah prayed this prayer before the Lord: “O Lord, God of Israel, you are enthroned between the mighty cherubim! You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You alone created the heavens and the earth. 
            <sup>16</sup> Bend down, O Lord, and listen! Open your eyes, O Lord, and see! Listen to Sennacherib’s words of defiance against the living God. 
            <sup>17</sup> “It is true, Lord, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all these nations. 
            <sup>18</sup> And they have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire and burned them. But of course the Assyrians could destroy them! They were not gods at all—only idols of wood and stone shaped by human hands. 
            <sup>19</sup> Now, O Lord our God, rescue us from his power; then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you alone, O Lord, are God.” 
        </i></p> <br><br>


        <p>King Hezekiah is not intimidated by Sennacherib’s words. He knows who his God is. His God is not a figment of his imagination or an idol made of stone or wood. His God is the Living God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. And his God is our God too.<br><br>

        That’s why when we face ridicule, discouragement, persecution, or any kind of trouble, we can do exactly what Hezekiah did. We can lay it all out before the Lord and say, "God, here’s my situation. Here are my circumstances. I know You are the God of the universe, and I trust in You."<br><br>
        
        Isn’t that reassuring? Isn’t it awesome to know that the Living God, who created heaven and earth, is on our side and we can trust in Him?<br><br>
        
        Hezekiah trusted in the Lord – and what happened? Let’s read and find out how our God acted on his behalf.
        </p><br><br>


        <p><i>Chapter 19 Verses 32-35 <br>
            <sup>32</sup> “And this is what the Lord says about the king of Assyria: “His armies will not enter Jerusalem. They will not even shoot an arrow at it. They will not march outside its gates with their shields nor build banks of earth against its walls. 
            <sup>33</sup> The king will return to his own country by the same road on which he came. He will not enter this city, says the Lord. 
            <sup>34</sup> For my own honor and for the sake of my servant David, I will defend this city and protect it.” 
            <sup>35</sup> That night the angel of the Lord went out to the Assyrian camp and killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. When the surviving Assyrians woke up the next morning, they found corpses everywhere. 
        </i></p> <br><br>


        <p>You know, this story really illustrates how unwise it is to trust in anything other than God. King Sennacherib believed he was unbeatable. He thought no nation or god could challenge him. What he didn’t understand was that the God of Israel was the one who had given him all his victories. God had planned long before for Sennacherib to defeat those nations.<br><br>

        So, when Sennacherib, in all his pride, decides to attack Jerusalem and mock the God of Israel, God shows him the truth. <br><br>
        
        God sends just one angel into his camp, and overnight, Sennacherib loses 185,000 men.<br><br>
        
        Did you know that God did not send His greatest and mightiest archangel, Michael, to defeat these soldiers? He only sent one angel, the lowest in rank. Even though it was the weakest and only one angel, it was still powerful enough to act on God's behalf and save His people.<br><br>
        
        But what lesson can we learn from this story? What does it teach us today?
        </p><br><br>


        <p><b>Conclusion:</b><br><br>
 
        Knowing that we have a mighty God who can defend us in any trouble, let us wholeheartedly place our trust in Him through prayer, just as King Hezekiah did in difficult situations. He is capable of doing great things beyond our comprehension if we only surrender our fears and uncertainties to His divine will. By fully trusting Him, we align ourselves with His power and purpose, ready to witness the wondrous deeds He will perform in our lives. As we face the challenges ahead, may our faith in God remain steadfast, knowing that His protection and grace will see us through every storm.<br><br>
        
        Don't be foolish and dismissive, thinking of these stories as mere tales. They are real accounts of God's powerful actions on behalf of those who love Him. God is unchanging—He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. If He performed such mighty deeds in the past, He can do the same for us today.<br><br>

        The story of King Sennacherib can also be found in many historical writings available in numerous books and on the internet. It is a factual event that brings together actual history and the scriptures from the Holy Bible.
