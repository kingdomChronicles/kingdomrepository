          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>

          <h2>Revelation 3:14-22</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">NASB2020 (New American Standard)</p>
          <p>   
              <sup>14</sup>  “To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Origin of the creation of God, says this: 
              <sup>15</sup>  ‘I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot. 
              <sup>16</sup> So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will vomit you out of My mouth. 
              <sup>17</sup> Because you say, “I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have no need of anything,” and you do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked, 
              <sup>18</sup> I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed; and eye salve to apply to your eyes so that you may see. 
              <sup>19</sup> Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent. 
              <sup>20</sup> Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me. 
              <sup>21</sup> The one who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne. 
              <sup>22</sup> The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”
          </p>

          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>


          <p><b><sup>14</sup>  “To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Origin of the creation of God, says this: </b> <br><br>
          
          Jesus refers to Himself as "the Amen, the faithful and true witness, and the beginning of God's creation." The term "Amen" signifies that He is God's complete and final revelation. <br><br>
          
          The author of Hebrews affirms that "long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our ancestors by the prophets, but in these last days, He has spoken to us by His Son." <br><br>

          He was the Word from the beginning and was God, as we have studied in our previous devotions. <br><br> 
          
          Today, He is speaking to us through this message.</p> <br>

          <p><b><sup>15</sup>  ‘I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot. </b> <br><br>

                             
          Nothing escapes Jesus' attention. <br><br> 
          
          In this verse, He tells the Laodicean church that He knows their condition. He says they are neither cold nor hot, although He would prefer they be one or the other. <br><br>
          
          This criticism of "lukewarm" faith has serious consequences. <br><br>
          
          At that time, room-temperature water was dangerous. Cold water came from a fresh spring or river, and hot water had been boiled or sanitized. <br><br>
          
          Anything in between was suspicious, potentially useless, and dangerous to drink or use. <br> <br>

          The church in Laodicea was neither passionate nor cold. It was just comfortable with staying the same. <br><br>


          They are not excited about Christian matters or the proclamation of the Kingdom of God in these last days, or they don't even care about these events. <br><br>

          While Jesus didn't praise the church in Philadelphia, He also didn't praise the church in Laodicea. However, in the church of Sardis, which symbolizes Christians with soft hearts to God's call, they obeyed and listened to the call to strengthen their faith. But in the church of Laodicea, there was nothing that can be fixed easily. <br><br>

          We see the same attitude in many churches today. They are neither passionate nor cold. They continue to engage in meaningless activities, give visitors weak handshakes, follow dull routines, and keep their members indifferent. <br><br>
          
          They remain churchgoers without seeking a serious relationship with their Creator. Even worse, some churches do things that go completely against what God instructed. <br><br>
          
          Another aspect of Jesus' desire for the church to be "hot or cold" relates to how we respond to the call regarding the Kingdom of God.<br><br>

          Those who are "hot" in spiritual matters are deeply committed to their faith. Those who are "cold" might not be involved, but they are in a position where they can be profoundly impacted and changed by faith. <br><br>
          
          However, those who are "lukewarm" have just enough knowledge of Christ to avoid resistance but lack enough real faith to be fully engaged. <br><br>
          
          This lukewarm condition is actually harder to change than converting someone who is fully cold and a non-believer.</p> <br>

          <p><b><sup>16</sup> So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will vomit you out of My mouth. </b> <br> <br>
          
          In this verse, Jesus describes the church in Laodicea as lukewarm. In ancient times, people would drink hot or cold beverages at feasts and religious ceremonies, but they never drank lukewarm drinks. Lukewarm liquids were distasteful and more likely to harbor diseases. Today, people find a cold drink refreshing on a hot day and a hot drink invigorating on a cold day, but no one enjoys a lukewarm drink. <br><br>

          Laodicea did not have its own water source, so it relied on the nearby city of Hierapolis for water. Hierapolis was built around many hot springs, providing an abundant supply of hot water sent to Laodicea through an aqueduct. However, by the time the water reached Laodicea, it had cooled to a lukewarm temperature. It would need to be cooled or reheated before it was safe to drink. The lukewarm spiritual state of the Laodiceans made Jesus so disgusted that He felt like spitting the church out of His mouth. <br><br>
      
          This analogy is relevant for people today as well. Those who are spiritually "hot" are deeply involved in their faith, while those who are "cold" have the potential to be profoundly influenced by the gospel through the Word of God. <br><br>

          However, those who are "lukewarm" are in a worse condition than those who are "cold." They know just enough about Jesus to not be resistant, but they are also somewhat indifferent to His voice. <br><br>
          
          From Jesus' perspective, it's actually better to be spiritually "cold" because it means you are in a serious and undeniable situation where you are more likely to notice God's call for help, change and comfort.</p> <br>

          <p><b><sup>17</sup> Because you say, “I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have no need of anything,” and you do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked,</b> <br> <br>
          
          Today, the Church of Laodicea represents the individuals whom God is calling. In this verse, there is a stark contrast between the church's self-perception and Jesus' perception of them. <br><br>

          
          Some people may see themselves great happiness in their material possessions, careers, business, education, or professions, but how sad, without God, Jesus sees them as poor. <br><br>
          
          
          Some may feel they need nothing, but in reality, they lack what only Jesus can provide. As the saying goes, money cannot buy happiness. Despite all their wealth, these individuals are actually "wretched," meaning unhappy. <br><br>

          Jesus also saw them as "pitiable," meaning miserable. It is possible to possess money, material possessions even good earthly career positions but still feel miserable. <br><br>

          Paul instructed Timothy to warn people that those who are eager for money can "fall into a trap, into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction." <br><br>

          Jesus also recognized that the spiritually impoverished people of the church were also blind and naked. They did not see the need to trust in the Lord or to share the gospel and the Word of God with the lost. <br><br>

          They had no vision. They were "naked," which is ironic considering the city exported abundant wool for clothing. <br><br> 
          
          Similarly, many people today may have their physical eyes open but are spiritually blind to the truths that God wants them to discover.
          </p>   <br>
          
          <p><b><sup>18</sup> I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed; and eye salve to apply to your eyes so that you may see.</b> <br> <br>
          
          The church of Laodicea and many people today, especially those who attend church but are complacent like the Laodiceans, are in a similar situation. <br><br>

          In response to the Laodicean church's self-satisfaction, Jesus advises them to buy pure gold from Him. He also offers them white garments and eye ointment. Gold, garments, and eye salve were the chief exports of Laodicea. <br><br>
          
          The apostle Peter described faith, refined by trials, as more valuable than gold. The Laodiceans boasted about their material wealth, but what they really needed was genuine faith, which is far more valuable than material riches. <br><br>

          The city was renowned for its production of glossy wool, yet Jesus offered the church members and the people white garments to cover their spiritual nakedness. <br><br>

          Like the Laodicean church, many people today and most churchgoers are blind to spiritual realities, focusing instead on earthly comforts and prosperity. <br><br>

          Laodicea was famous for its eye salve used to treat various eye diseases. Jesus offers a salve that could cure spiritual blindness. <br><br>

          Symbolically, if the Laodiceans applied the eye salve Jesus offered, they would be able to see their lukewarm condition and, consequently, repent.</p> <br>

      
          <p><b><sup>19</sup> Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent. </b> <br> <br>
          
          In this verse, Jesus calls on the Laodiceans to change their ways, to be enthusiastic about repentance. They must turn away from their indifference and reestablish their relationship with God. Despite their wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked condition, Jesus still loves them. He explains that He rebukes and disciplines those He loves. <br><br>

          At times, God uses difficult trials or physical afflictions to discipline His wayward children, but He does so as a loving father. <br><br>

          As what the Hebrews explains, <br><br>

          " Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits, and live? <br><br>

          For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness. <br><br>

          For the moment, all discipline seems not to be pleasant, but painful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness. " <br><br>

          What comforting words! Although discipline can be painful, it is not permanent and it produces righteousness in us. <br><br>

          When we experience discipline, we should not believe that God has abandoned us. He is actually investing time in our spiritual growth. His intention is not to make us bitter but to make us better.</p> <br>

          <p><b><sup>20</sup> Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me.</b> <br> <br>
          
          This verse portrays Jesus standing outside the church in Laodicea, knocking at its door, waiting to be welcomed and admitted. He does not force His way in but patiently seeks to be invited. <br><br>

          If the church had invited Jesus in, He would undoubtedly have entered. However, the church did not extend an invitation. <br><br>
          
          So Jesus sought an invitation from any individual who would respond. He promised to fellowship with anyone who would hear His voice and open the door. <br><br>
          
          While this verse is often used as an invitation for unbelievers to accept Jesus as Savior, it also applies directly to anyone who is indifferent like the Laodicean church. <br><br>
          
          Jesus is eager to restore everyone to a better state, but they must show their willingness to obey God.</p> <br>

          <p><b><sup>21</sup> The one who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne. </b> <br> <br>
          
          Jesus continues His promise to anyone who responds to His call with a warm welcome, thereby overcoming lukewarm faith. <br><br>

          He promises to give that repentant overcomer the honor of sitting with Him on His throne, just as He sits with His Father on His throne. <br><br>
          
          Although Jesus currently sits on the throne in heaven, someday He will leave that throne to occupy the throne on earth. The angel Gabriel told Mary that her child, Jesus, would "be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His father David, and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end." <br><br>
          
          This is the same kingdom that we, the people of the Last Days generation are waiting for. <br><br>

          Undoubtedly, the promise to the repentant overcomer anticipates the privilege of participating in Jesus' kingdom administration here on earth soon.</p> <br>

          <p><b><sup>22</sup> The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”</b> <br> <br>
          
          This verse is Jesus' last challenge, and it applies to us as well. We should listen to Jesus' messages to the churches. <br><br>

          From the message to the Laodicean church, we learn not to be self-satisfied or lazy, but to keep ourselves open for Jesus to enter and take control of every aspect of our lives.</p> <br> <br>

          <p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

          <p>The Church of Laodicea represents the churches of the Last Days. <br><br>
              
          The seven churches in Revelation symbolize various types of churches that have existed from the early days of Christianity until today. <br><br>
          
          Laodicea represents the church that will witness the establishment of God's Kingdom on earth. <br><br>
          
          Sadly, many of its members will find themselves outside the door of His Kingdom, knocking to be let in, but it will be too late to repent when that moment comes. <br><br>

          If you resemble the Laodicean Church, kneel down now and sincerely talk to God. <br><br>
          
          Don't let the day end without confessing and repenting of all your past deeds and actions to God. Surrender your life sincerely. <br><br>
          
          Don't assume or declare that you are already saved. Your actions will speak louder than your beliefs. <br><br>
          
          It's better to humbly repent to God and ask Him to guide you in every step of your life, starting today and continuing until your last breath or until His return.</p>
