      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Morning</p>

      <h2>1 John 2:15-17</h2>
      <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
      
      <p> 
        <sup>15</sup>  Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
        <sup>16</sup> For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. 
        <sup>17</sup> And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. 
      </p>


      <br><hr>
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p>John mentions “the world” six times in these three verses. <br><br>

            The central message here is "Do not love the world; love the Father." However, this is easier said than done. <br><br>

            We can see the world. <br><br>

            We cannot see the Father. <br><br>

            Given these two options, we often prefer what we can see. <br><br>

        </p> <br><br>

        <p><b><sup>15</sup>  Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</b> <br><br>
        
        
            This is not merely a suggestion; it’s a command: “Do not love the world.” <br><br>

            Through his Apostle John, the God of the universe is speaking. With his authority as the ruler and creator, he has the right to command us.<br><br>
            
            However, God’s commands are always paired with his grace. Whatever he commands, he also gives us the strength and the ability so that we can have the capacity to obey.<br><br>
            
            So, what is the world? <br><br>            
            
            It is the entire system that rebels against God and his rule.<br><br>

            F.F. Bruce says, “Worldliness…does not lie in things we do or in places we frequent; it lies in the human heart, in the set of human affections and attitudes.”<br><br>

            This is so important. If you don't understand this, you won't understand the passage. John is not saying that the world God created is bad. He’s saying that the way we relate to what God made can be bad. <br><br>

            To John, worldliness means thinking that the world is all that ultimately matters - placing it above the Father.  <br><br>
            
            What makes the world bad is not the things in it - which came from God - but how we treat those things.<br><br>

            We cannot love the world (view it as ultimate) and love the Father (view Him as ultimate) at the same time. <br><br>
            
            One must come first in our heart. <br><br>
            
            John says it should be the Father.<br><br>

            We know we shouldn’t love the world. <br><br>
            
            But its pull is strong, and we are tempted. The world never stops making offers, and our flesh never stops being tempted.       
            
            John understands this, so he gives us reasons not to love the world. <br><br>

            The world is against the Father, and the world will pass away.
        </p> <br> <br>

        <p><b><sup>16</sup> For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world.</b> <br><br>
        
        The belief that the world is ultimate originated from the world itself. When sin entered, we replaced God with God's creation. We distorted and twisted God’s good gifts into our ultimate hope.<br><br>

        John describes three categories of worldliness: “the desires of the flesh, the desires of the eyes, and the pride of life.”</p><br>


        <p><b>Desires of the Flesh:</b>
        Understanding this passage hinges on grasping what we love, which is all about what we desire. It's not just a preference but a deep desire for something—wanting it above everything else. <br><br>
            
        When John says “the desires of the flesh,” he’s referring to the misguided focus of that desire on things we can see, touch, and feel—things like food, drink, leisure, sex, rest, enjoyment, comfort—anything that appeals to our bodily senses.</p>



        <p><b>Desires of the Eyes:</b> This refers to beauty, attractiveness, glamour—what appeals to our sight. It’s when you see something you just have to have. For some, it’s pornography, lusting after what we shouldn’t look at. For others, it’s the “Instagrammable” life, looking great on the outside even if you’re struggling and empty inside.</p>



        <p><b>Pride of Life:</b> 
        This is self-exaltation, thinking that what you have and what you are is all your own doing—pride in possessions, financial means, property, livelihood. <br><br>
            
        The pride of life results from the other two desires and sustains them. It represents the peak of idolatry, where we love what we’ve accomplished or accumulated more than anything else.<br><br>
            
        The more we focus our desires on the world and let the world’s mindset grow within us, the more we push God to the edges of our heart.</p> <br> <br>


        <p><b><sup>17</sup> And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.</b> <br><br>
        
        If you spend your life investing in the wrong things, it's over. You cannot pause time and start again; you can't bring back the past. If you miss your chance to do God's will, it's gone. Every worldly desire leads to a dead end. <br><br>

        Don’t misunderstand this. You can be wealthy and close to God, and you can be poor and close to God. This isn't about material wealth. It’s about how you relate to it—what you build your identity on. If you base your life on the temporary things of the world, you will fade away with them. You’ll waste your life. <br><br>
        
        But if you build your life on the will of God, you and your purpose will last forever. <br><br>
        
        That’s why it’s so important that once you start to connect with God, you don’t waste any part of yourself anymore. Use all your remaining strength, years, and possessions to serve God. <br><br>
        
        We must use everything we have in this world for God's glory and for the expansion of the Kingdom of God on earth.</p> <br>



        <p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

        

        <p>The term "epithumia" that John uses refers to an intense desire or longing for something specific. This intense desire is inherent in every human being. This desire is often directed towards things of the world, but ultimately, it is a longing for something deeper and more profound. Many theologians and scholars suggest that this desire is ultimately a longing for God, even though people may not always recognize it as such.<br><br>

        That's why, if we don't know God, we seek answers around us.<br><br>
        
        All people have this capacity for such strong desire because God Himself created it.<br><br>
        
        Why did He create it?<br><br>
        
        To go unmet?<br><br>
        
        Do you think that desire is meant to be wasted on the fleeting things of the world?<br><br>
        
        No way!<br><br>
        
        He created it to be filled with Himself.<br><br>
        
        Why?<br><br>
        
        Because God is the most satisfying being in the whole universe.<br><br>
        
        By creating us with this desire, <br><br>
        
        He gave us the capacity to truly experience Him and find the deepest happiness in our lives.<br><br>
        
        So, to focus our desire on the world rather than on the Father is to focus on what can never satisfy.<br><br>
        
        We need to stop searching in vain for the world's treasures and instead seek the immeasurable riches of Christ. It is in Him that our desires will be truly satisfied. <br><br>
        
        Remember, in the Kingdom of God, whoever does the will of God abides forever.
        Whoever comes to God with a heart longing for His grace will find it. <br><br>

        And every godly desire leads to eternity.</p>
