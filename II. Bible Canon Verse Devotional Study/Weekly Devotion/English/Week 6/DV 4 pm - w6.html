      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>

      <h2>Deuteronomy 30:19-20</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle"> AMP (Amplified Version)</p>
                

                <p>       
                  <sup>19</sup> I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore, you shall choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants, 
                  <sup>20</sup> by loving the Lord your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding closely to Him; for He is your life [your good life, your abundant life, your fulfillment] and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the Lord promised (swore) to give to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
                </p>

                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><b><sup>19</sup> I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse;</b> <br><br>
                    
                In these most solemn words, Moses gave Israel a choice. They had to choose between life and death, blessing and cursing. <br><br>

                The same is true for us now; we face the same choice. The question is, “Will I obey God or not?” Jesus said, "He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters." Jesus is still asking, "Who do you say I am?" How we answer this question determines our eternal destiny. We have heard and studied His words. We must decide whether to follow God's way or stop our spiritual journey.
                <br><br>

                Spiritually, both heaven and earth, along with all of God's angels, are our witnesses and are waiting for our decision now—whether at this moment we choose life or death or to pursue on the Kingdom of God or to stay on the bondage of the Kingdom of Darkness. </p> <br><br>


                <p><b>therefore, you shall choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants, <br>
                    <sup>20</sup> by loving the Lord your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding closely to Him; for He is your life [your good life, your abundant life, your fulfillment] and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the Lord promised (swore) to give to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”</b> <br><br> 
                    
                    At the same time, though the choice belonged to Israel, the choice also belongs to us now. God cares about what we choose.
                    <br><br>
    
                    When Moses pleaded with Israel, crying out for life, we know he reflected the heart of God toward Israel. Jesus is also pleading with us now because He loves us dearly. But God is so respectful of our own decisions; what He can do is show His gracious love towards us, but He cannot help us if we do not want to choose His ways. <br><br>
                
                    My child, choose life because He cares for you so much. Don't waste the sacrifice of the Messiah, the Son of God, who died on the cross for you. Don't waste the sacrifices of all the chosen people who prepared you for this moment. Don't waste the death of the apostles and martyrs who wrote and brought this testimony; don't waste the lives, blood, and resources of the people behind the this Devotional Program meant to show this generation God's good and wonderful purpose for all His creation. <br><br>
                
                    How God glorified Himself through Israel was up to them, but it was obviously God's preference that He glorify Himself through an obedient, blessed nation of Israel. <br><br>
                    
                    The same is true for us today: God wants to glorify Himself through our lives as obedient children of God.
                    <br><br>
                
                    God is pleading with you right now. <br><br>
                
                    Choose life! That you may love the LORD your God. To love God this way, to really trust Him, is well explained in His words.
                    <br><br>

                    To love and trust God means to obey His voice, for a child who really loves and trusts their father will obey him. It means to cling to Him, for if we really love and trust Him, we will be attached to Him. It means to regard Him as our life throughout all our days, because if we love and trust Him, He is not just part of our lives;
                    <br><br>
                     
                     <b>He is our life. Your will be done always Lord.</b></p> <br><br>
