      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>

          <h2>Romans 6:12-13</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
                <p>
                  <sup>12</sup> Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. 
                  <sup>13</sup> Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness.
                </p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p>This devotional verse reminds us that we live under the power of grace, not law. Before we placed our faith in Jesus, we were slaves to sin, powerless against it. But God, in His mercy, opened our eyes to His grace through Jesus.<br><br>

                  Dear brothers and sisters, remember that before we placed our faith in Jesus, we were slaves to sin, under its control. We had no power over sin in our lives. However, God, in His mercy, sacrificed His Son to open our eyes to His grace, so we could be reconciled to Him through sincere repentance and a true change from our old ways.<br><br>
                  
                  Therefore, do not let sin rule in your body, causing you to obey its evil desires. Perhaps our sinful actions have lessened because we regularly attend fellowship activities. But can we assess ourselves—have we truly eliminated sinful desires, or just reduced them? God wants all of us, not just a part. The presence of evil within us shows that we are not fully surrendered to God, holding back some part of ourselves to do what we want, rather than what God wants.<br><br>
                  
                  We have learned the importance of daily fellowship with God through His Word. If we have perfectly obeyed what we have learned in our daily devotions, it is commendable because it shows we are learning to be obedient to God. God desires our obedience to guide and protect us from the enemy's schemes. But if you have committed to obeying God's Word and still fail, why is that? We are told to fellowship with Him day and night. Why miss this opportunity? Why focus on material things that will fade away? Are you hard-hearted towards communing with God? Do you truly love God, or do you only say you do while your heart is distant?<br><br>
                  
                  Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness. If you can't dedicate part of your daily life to God, it shows you haven't truly turned away from yourself. Your time belongs to you, not to God, yet you claim to be His child. Don't be a hypocrite. Hypocrites will be cast into hell. They worship God with their lips, but their hearts are far from Him. If you worship Him in your heart, sincerely follow and obey His Word.<br><br>
                  
                  Soon, His Spirit will no longer convict people. Don’t wait until the door of the Kingdom is closed to hard-hearted sinners. God is serious about calling people to repentance because He knows the impending doom for those who reject Him. This is why Jesus sacrificed His life—for those who sincerely repent to be saved from judgment, including the judgment of Satan.<br><br>
                  
                  We are instructed to offer every part of our lives as instruments of righteousness. How can we do that if we don’t dedicate our time to God? Brothers and sisters, God calls us to have a serious relationship with Him. Don’t ignore God in your life. True fellowship with God happens not just in church but in your daily walk with Him.</p>
