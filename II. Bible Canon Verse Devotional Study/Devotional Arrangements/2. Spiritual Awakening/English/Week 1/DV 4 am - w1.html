                <h2>John 1:1-4</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">CEB (Common English Bible)</p>
                <p>
                    <sup>1</sup> In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. 
                    <sup>2</sup> The Word was with God in the beginning. 
                    <sup>3</sup> Everything came into being through the Word, and without the Word nothing came into being. What came into being 
                    <sup>4</sup> through the Word was life, and the life was the light for all people.
                </p>

                <p>The simplest and straight forward understanding to this verses.</p>

                <p><b>The Word was God.</b></p>

                <p>The Word was in the begining... <br> because,</p>

                <p><b>The Word was God.</b></p>

                <p>God is the creator of everything and everything came into existence through the Word <br> because,</p>

                <p><b>The Word was God.</b></p>

                <p>The Word was life, and that life was the light for everyone. God is the source of life and the light for all people <br> because,</p>

                <p><b>The Word was God.</b></p> <br>


                <p><b><i>Truth that everyone must understand.</i></b></p>

                <p>If you want to seek God, do so through His Words. Don’t look for Him in religions, self-help books, or inspirational books. Go directly to the Word of God. Seek Him with all your heart, and you will find Him in His Words.</p>

                <p>If you want to serve God, study His Word to learn how to serve Him correctly. Don’t serve Him through religions, traditions, or human ways. We must serve God according to what is written in His Word.</p>

                <p>If you profess love for God, you must love His Words. It's contradictory to claim to love God while despising His Words.</p>

                <p>If you wish to obey God, then follow what His Words say. You cannot obey God without obeying His commandments as written in His Words.</p>

                <p>If you seek answers from God, read His Words to find His response to you.</p>

                <p>If His Words reside in your hearts, it means that God dwells in your heart. However, if His Words do not reside in you, it means that God is not in you.</p>

                <p>If you love His Words, it reflects your love for God. Similarly, if you are not interested in His Words, it indicates that you are not interested in God.</p>

                <p>The way you treat the Word of God reflects how you treat God Himself.</p>

                <p>God and His Words are inseparable.</p>

                <p><i>If you have a headset then better use one and feel God's presence while you pray. Sing a song to God through this Music Video/s</i></p>
