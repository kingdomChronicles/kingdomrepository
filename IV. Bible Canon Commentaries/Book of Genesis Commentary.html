    <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
    <p>"The first book of the Bible is for several reasons one of the most interesting and fascinating portions of Scripture. Its place in the Canon, its relation to the rest of the Bible, and the varied and striking character of its contents combine to make it one of the most prominent in Holy Writ. It is with a real spiritual insight, therefore, that the people of God in all ages have fastened upon this book, and given it their earnest attention."• <br>

    <h2>III. Unique Place in the Canon</h2>
                <p>Genesis (Greek for "Beginning"), called <i>Bereshith</i> by the Jews (Hebrew for "In the beginning"), is well named. This exciting volume gives the only true account of creation by the only One who was there—the Creator!</p>

                <p>Through His servant Moses, the Holy Spirit traces the beginnings of man, woman, marriage, the home, sin, sacrifices, cities, trade, agriculture, music, worship, languages, and the races and nations of the world. All this in the first eleven chapters. </p>

                <p>Then, from chapters 12-50 we see the beginnings of Israel, God's "test-tube nation," to be a spiritual microcosm of all the peoples of the world. The lives of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and his twelve sons, especially the attractively devout Joseph, have inspired untold millions, from young children to advanced OT scholars.</p>

                <p> A solid grasp of Genesis is necessary for an understanding of the rest of the sixty-five books of the Bible. They all build on its beautifully proportioned literary base.</p>
    
    <h2>IV. Authorship</h2>
                <p> We accept the ancient Jewish and Christian teaching that Genesis was written and compiled by Moses the man of God and Lawgiver of Israel. Since all the events in Genesis are pre-Mosaic it is virtually certain that Moses used ancient documents and perhaps oral accounts as he was guided by the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <h2>V. Date</h2>
                <p>The most conservative scholars generally date the Exodus about 1445 B.C.. Hence Genesis would probably have been written between this date and Moses' death about forty years later. It is always possible, of course, that this one book of the Pentateuch was written before the Exodus, since all the events in Genesis predate that great event.</p>

    <h2>VI. Background and Themes</h2>
                <p>Except for those who are extremely biased against the Bible, Judaism, or Christianity, nearly everyone agrees that Genesis is a fascinating account of very ancient times and contains narratives of great beauty, such as the story of Joseph.</p>
                
                <p>But just what is the <i>background</i> of this first book of the Bible. In short, what is it?</p>

                <p>Those who reject a personal God have tended to class Genesis as a collection of <i>myths</i> adapted from pagan Mesopotamian myths and "cleaned up" from their worst polytheistic elements for monotheistic Hebrew edification.</p>

                <p>Others, not quite as skeptical, see Genesis as a collection of <i>sagas</i> or <i>legends</i>, with some historical value.</p>

                <p>Yet others see the stories as explanations of the origins of things in nature and culture (technically called <i>etiologies</i>). There are etiologies in the OT, especially in this book of beginnings (the origin of sin, the rainbow, the Hebrew people, e.g.), but this by no means makes the explanation unhistorical.</p>

                <p>Genesis is <i>history</i>. Like all history, it is interpretative. It is <i>theological</i> history or facts narrated in a framework of the divine plan. It has been well said that "history is His story."</p>

                <p>Though Genesis is the first book of the "law" there is very little <i>legal</i> material in it. It is <i>"Law"</i> ( <i>Torah</i>, Hebrew for instruction ) in that it lays the foundation for Exodus through Deutoronomy and God's giving of the Law through Moses. In fact, it lays the foundation of all Bible history - yes of history itself.</p>

                <p>The twin <i>themes</i> of blessing and cursing are carefully woven throughout the fabric of Genesis, and indeed, the whole word of God. Obedience brings enrichment of blessing, and disobedience the opposite. </p>

                <p>The great <i>curses</i> are the penalties of the fall, the universal Flood, and the confusion of tongues at Babel.</p>

                <p>The great <i>blessings</i> are the promise of a Redeemer, the salvation of a remnant through the Flood, and the choice of a special nation to be a channel of God's grace, Israel.</p>

                <p>If Genesis is factual history, how could Moses have known all the ancient geneologies, conversations, events, and correct interpretations of this events?</p>

                <p>First, let it be said, that archeology has supported (not "proved" but confirmed and illustrated) the Genesis account in many areas, especially regarding the patriachs and their customs.</p>

                <p>Some nineteenth-century liberals, such as Hartmann, taught that Moses could not have written the Pentateuch because writing had not been invented! Now we know that Moses could have written in any one of several ancient scripts, being learned in all the lore of Egypt.</p>

                <p>Moses no doubt used accounts left by Joseph, and the tablets, parchments and oral translations brought from ancient Mesopotamia by Abraham and his descendants. These would include the geneologies, the major sections, known as "the generations of Adam," etc.</p>

                <p>In the final analysis this is still not enough. The Holy Spirit of God inspired Moses to choose exactly the right materials and to ignore the rest. He probably supplied details of conversations and other things by direct revelation.</p>

                <p>It comes down to a matter of faith. Either God is capable of producing such a work through His servants or He is not. Believers of all generations from primeval times to today have set their seal that God is true.</p>

                <p>Archeology can help us reconstruct the culture of the patriarchs to make the Bible accounts more vivid, but only the Holy Spirit can illuminate the truth of Genesis to our hearts and daily lives.</p>

                <p>As you read the Believer's Bible Commentary on Genesis - or any of the OT books - you must be dependent on the Spirit's illumination of the Holy Word itself to really benefit from the comments.</p>

                <p>A true commentary is not an independent means, but an arrow, pointing to a " thus says the Lord."</p>
