    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
                        <p><sup id="1:1">1:1</sup> <b>"In the beginning God...."</b> This first four words of the Bible form the foundation for faith. Believe these words, and you can believe all that follows in the Bible. Genesis provides the only authoritative account of creation, meaningful for people of all ages but exhaustible by no one. The divine record assumes the existence of God rather than seeking to prove it. The Bible has a special name for those who choose to deny the fact of God. That name is <i>fool</i> (ps. 14:1 and 53:1). Just as the Bible begins with God, so He should be first in our lives. </p>

                        <p><sup>1:2</sup> One of several conservative interpretations of the Genesis account of creation, the creation-reconstruction view, says that between verses 1 and 2 a great catastrophe occured, perhaps the fall of Satan (see Ezekiel 28:11-19). This caused God's original, perfect creation to become <b>without form and void</b> (<i>t&#333;h&#251; w&#257;v&#333;h&#251;</i>). Since God didn't <i>create</i> the earth waste and empty (see Isaiah 45:18), only a mighty cataclysm could explain the chaotic condition of verse 2. Proponents of this view point out that the word translated <b>was</b> (h&#257;yeth&#257;) could also be translated "had become." Thus the earth "had become waste and empty."</p>

                        <p><b>The Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters,</b> preparatory to the great creative and reconstructive acts to follow. The remaining verses describe the six days of creation and reconstruction which prepared the earth for human habitation.</p>

                        <p><sup>1:3 - 5</sup> On  <b>the first day God</b> commanded <b>light</b> to shine out of <b>darkness</b> and established the <b>Day</b> and <b>Night</b> cycle. This act is not to be confused with the establishment of the sun, moon and stars on the fourth day. In <b>2 Corinthians 4:6</b> the Apostle Paul draws a parallel between the original separation of light from darkness and the conversion of a sinner.</p>

                        <p><sup>1:6 - 8</sup> Prior to  <b>the second day,</b> it seems that the earth was completely surrounded by a thick layer of water, perhaps in a form of heavy vapor. On <b>the second day</b> God divided this layer, part covering the earth with water and part forming clouds, with the atmospheric layers ( <b>firmament</b> or "dome" ) between. <b>God called the firmament Heaven</b> - that is, the expanse of space immediately above the earth (not the stellar heavens, nor the third heaven where God dwells). Verse 20 makes it clear that the heaven here is the sphere where the birds fly. </p>

                        <p><sup>1:9 - 13</sup> <b>Then God</b> caused <b>the dry land</b> to <b>appear</b> out of the <b>waters</b> that covered the face of the planet. Thus were born the <b>Earth</b> and the <b>Seas</b>. Also on <b>the third day</b> He caused vegetation and trees of all kinds to spring up in the earth.</p>

                        <p><sup>1:14 - 19</sup> It was not until <b>the fourth day</b> that the Lord set the sun, moon, and <b>stars</b> in <b>the heavens</b> as light bearers and as means for establishing a calendar.</p>

                        <p><sup>1:20 - 23</sup> <b>The fifth day</b> saw <b>the waters</b> stocked with fish and the earth stocked with bird-life and insects. The word translated <b>birds</b> means "flying ones" and includes bats and probably flying insects. </p>

                        <p><sup>1:24 - 25</sup> On <b>the sixth day</b> God first created animals and reptiles. The law of the reproduction is repeatedly given in the words <b>according to its kind</b>. There are significant variations within "kinds" of biological life, but there is no passing from one kind to another. </p>

                        <p><sup>1:26 - 28</sup> The crown of God's work was the creation of <b>main in</b> His <b>image and according to </b> His <b>likeness</b>. This means that man was placed on earth as God's representative, and that He resembles God in certain ways. Just as God is a Trinity (Father, Son Holy Spirit), so man is a tripartite being (spirit, soul, and body). Like God, man has intellect, a moral nature, the power to communicate with others, and an emotional nature that transcends instinct. There is no thought of physical likeness here. In contrast to animals, man is a worshiper, an articulate communicator, and a creator. </p>

                        <p> There is an allownce for or even an intimation of the Trinity in verse 26: <b>Then God</b> [ <i>Elohim</i>, plural ] <b>said</b> [singular verb in Hebrew], <b>Let Us</b> [plural] <b>make man in Our image..."</b> </p>

                        <p> The Bible describes the origin of the sexes as a creative act of God. Evolution has never been able to explain how the sexes began. Humanity was commanded to <b>be fruitful and multiply</b>. </p>

                        <p> God gave man a mandate to <b>subdue</b> creation and <b>have dominion over</b> it - to use it but not abuse it. The modern crises in the earth's environment are due to man's greed, selfishness, and carelessness.</p>

                        <p><sup>1:29 - 30</sup> It is clear from this verses that animals were originally herbivorous and that man was vegetarian. This was changed after the flood ( see chapter 9:1-7 ). </p>

                        <p>Were the six day of creation literal 24 - hour days, or were they geological ages? Or were they days of "dramatic vision" during which the creation account was <i>revealed</i> to Moses? No scientific evidence has ever  refuted the concept that they were literal solar days. The expression "the evening and the morning" points to 24 - hour days. Everywhere else in the OT these words mean normal days. Adam lived through the seventh day and died in his 930th year, so the seventh day could not have been a geological age. Wherever the "day" is used with a number in the OT  (" first day," etc.) it means a literal day. When God commanded Israel to rest on the Sabbath day,  He based the command on the fact that He had rested on the seventh day, after six days of labor ( Exodus 20: 8-11 ). Consistent interpretation here requires the same meaning of the word "day."</p>

                        <p>A difficulty, however, is that the solar day as we know it may not begun until the fourth day (chapter 1:14-19).</p>

                        <p>As far as the Bible is concerned, the creation of the heavens and the earth is undated. The creation of man is undated also. However, geneologies are given, and,even allowing for posible gaps in the geneologies, man could not have been on the earth for the millions of years demanded by evolutionists.</p>

                        <p>We learn from John 1:1, 14, Colossians 1:16, and Hebrews 1:2 that the Lord Jesus was the Active agent in creation. For the inexhaustible wonders of His creation, He is worthy of endless worship.</p>

                        <p><sup>1:31</sup> At the end of the six days of creation <b>God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good.</b> </p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

                        <p><sup>2:1-3</sup> God <b>rested</b> from His creative activity <b>on the seventh day.</b> This is not the rest that follows weariness but the rest of satisfaction and completion of a job well done. Although God did not command man to keep the Sabbath at this time, He taught the principle of one day of rest in seven. </p>

                        <p><sup>2:4-6</sup> The name Lord <b>God</b>  (Jehovah [Yaweh] Elohim ) appears for the first time in verse 4, but only after the creation of man (chapter 1:27). As <i>Elohim</i>, God is the Creator. As <i>Jehovah</i>, He is in covenant relation with man. Failing to see this, some Bible critics have concluded that these different names for God can only be explained by a change of authorship.</p>

                        <p> <b>This is the history</b> (verse 4) refers to the beginnings described in chapter 1. Verse 5, which reads, <b>"before any plant of the field was in the earth and before any herb of the field had grown,"</b> describes condition on the earth in 1:10, when the dry land appeared but before vegetation appeared. <b>The earth</b> was watered by <b>a mist</b> rather than by <b>rain.</b> </p>

                        <p><sup>2:7</sup> A fuller account of the creation of <b>man</b> is now given. <b>God formed</b> his body from <b>the dust of the ground,</b> but only the impartation of <b>the breath</b> of God made him <b>a living being.</b> Adam ("red" or "ground") was named after the red earth from which he was made. </p>

                        <p><sup>2:8-14</sup> The <b>garden</b> that <b>God planted in Eden</b> was toward the east, i.e., east of Palestine, the point of referrence for Bible directions. It was located in the region of Mesopotamia, near the <b>Hiddekel</b> (Tigris) and <b>Euprhates</b> Rivers. <b>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil</b> provided a test of men's obedience. The only reason it was wrong to eat of that fruit was because God had said so. In different forms, that fruit is <i>still with us today.</i></p>

                        <p><sup>2:15-23</sup> The penalty for violating the commandment was death (verse 17) - instant spiritual death and progressive physical death. In the process of naming the animals and birds, Adam would have noticed that there were males and females. Each one had a mate that was similar to itself, yet different. This prepared Adam for <b>a helper</b> who would be <b>comparable to</b> himself. His bride was formed from <b>one of his ribs,</b> taken from his side as <b>he slept</b>. So from Christ's side, His Bride was secured as He shed His life's blood in untold agony. <b>Woman</b> was taken not from Adam's head to dominate him, nor from His feet to be trodden down, but from under his arm to be protected, and from near his heart to be loved.</p>

                        <p>God gave headship to man before sin entered. Paul argues this fact from the order of creation (man was created first) and the purpose of creation (woman was made for the man) (1 Corinthians 11:8,9). Also, although it was Eve who sinned first, it is by Adam, the head, that sin is said to have entered the world. He had the position of head and was thus responsible.</p>

                        <p>Verse 19 is clearer with the English pluperfect tense. <b>"The Lord God</b> had <b>formed... every beast,"</b> i.e., He made man.</p>

                        <p><sup>2:24</sup> With the words of verse 24 God instituted monogamous marriage. Like all divine institutions, it was established for man's good and cannot be violated with impunity. The marriage bond illustrates the relationship that exists between Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5:22-32).</p>

                        <p><sup>2:25</sup> Although Adam and Eve lived in the Garden of Eden without any clothes, they <b>were not ashamed</b>.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
                        <p><sup id="3:1">3:1-6</sup> <b>The serpent</b> that appeared to Eve is later revealed to be none other than Satan himself (see Revelation 12:9). Those who seek to "demythologize" the Bible believe that this account of the fall is allegorical and not literal. They cite the talking serpent's deceiving Eve be accepted as factual? The Apostle Paul thought so ( 2 Corinthians 11:3). So did the Apostle John (Revelation 12:9; 20:2). Nor is this the only instance of a talking animal in Scripture. God gave a voice to Balaam's donkey to restrain the madness of the prophet (Numbers 22), and the Apostle Peter accepted this as literal ( 2 Peter 2:16). These three apostles were inspired by the Holy Spirit to write as they did. Thus to reject the account of the fall as literal is to reject the inspiration of Holy Scripture. There are allegories in the Bible, but this is not one of them.</p>

                        <p>Notice the steps that plunged the human race into sin. First Satan insinuated doubt about the Word of God: <b>"Has God indeed said?"</b> He misrepresented God as forbidding Adam and Eve to <b>eat of every tree.</b> Next, Eve said that they were <b>not</b> to <b>eat</b> or <b>touch "the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden."</b> But God has said nothing about <i>touching</i> the tree. Then Satan flatly contradicted God about the inevitability of judgment on those who disobeyed, just as his followers still deny the facts of hell and eternal punishment. Satan misrepresented God as seeking to withhold from Adam and Eve something that would have been beneficial to them. Eve yielded to threefold temptation: the lust of the flesh ( <b>good for food</b>), the lust of the eyes ( <b>pleasant to the eyes</b> ), and the pride of life ( <b>a tree disirable to make one wise</b> ). In doing so, she acted indepently of Adam, her head.  She should have consulted him instead of usurping his authority. In the words <b>"she took of its fruit and ate"</b> lie the explanation of all the sickness, sorrow, suffering, fear, guilt and death that have plagued the human race ever since that time. Someone has said, "The wreckage of earth and a million billion graves attest that God is true and Satan is the liar." Eve was deceived ( 1 Timothy 2:14), but Adam acted willfully and in deliberately rebellion against God.</p>

                        <p>Seculiar humanism perpetuates Satan's lie, "You will be like God."</p>

                        <p><sup>3:7-13</sup> The first result of sin was a sense of shame and fear. The aprons of <b>fig leaves</b> speak of man's attempt to save himself by a bloodless religion of good works. When called to account by God, sinners excuse themselves. Adam said <b>"The woman whom You gave to be with me..."</b> as if blaming God ( see Proverbs 19:3). Eve said. <b>"The serpent..."</b> (verse 13).</p>

                        <p>In love and mercy God search after His fallen creatures with the question <b>"Where are you"</b> This question proved two things - that man was lost and that God had come to seek. It proves man's sin and God's grace. God takes the initiative in salvation, demonstrating the very thing Satan got Eve to doubt - His love.</p>

                        <p><sup>3:14</sup> <b>The Lord God</b> cursed the <b>serpent</b> to degradation, disgrace, and defeat. The fact that the serpent is <b>cursed more than cattle</b> or any other <b>beast of the field</b> suggests that reptiles are primarily in view here rather than Satan.</p>

                        <p><sup>3:15</sup> But verse 15 switches to the Devil himself. This verse is known as the <i>protoevangelium</i>, meaning  "The First Gospel." It predicts the perpetual hostility <b>between</b> Satan and <b>the woman</b> (representing all mankind), <b>and between</b> Satan's <b>seed</b> (his agents) <b>and her Seed</b> (the Messiah). The woman's <b>Seed</b> would crush the Devil's <b>head</b>, a mortal wound spelling utter defeat. This wound was administered at Calvary when the Savior decisively triump over the Devil.  Satan, in  turn, would <b>bruise</b> the Messiah's <b>heel</b>. The <b>heel</b> would here speaks of suffering and even of physical death, but not of ultimate defeat. So Christ suffered on the cross, and even died, but He arose from the dead, victorious over sin, hell, and Satan. The fact that He is called the <i>woman's</i> <b>Seed</b> may contain a suggestion of His virgin birth. Note the kindness of God in promising the Messiah pronouncing sentence in the following verses.</p>

                        <p><sup>3:16-19</sup> Sin has inevitable consequences. <b>The woman</b> was sentenced to suffering in childbirth. She would be subject to her <b>husband</b>. The man was sentenced to earn his livelihood from <b>ground</b> that was <b>cursed</b> with <b>thorns and thistles</b>. It would mean <b>toil</b> and sweat for him.Then at the end of life, he himself would <b>return</b> to <b>dust</b>. It should be noted here that work itself is <i>not</i> a curse; it is more often a blessing. It is the sorrow, toil, frustration, perspiration, and weariness connected with work that are the curse.</p>

                        <p><sup>3:20,21</sup> <b>Adam</b> displayed faith in calling <b>his wife's name Eve... the mother of all living</b>, since no baby had ever been born up to this time. Then <b>tunics of skin</b> were provided by God through the death of an animal. This pictures the robe of righteousness which is provided for guilty sinners through the shed blood of the Lamb of God, made available to us on the basis of faith.</p>

                        <p><sup>3:22-24</sup> There was a shade of truth in Satan's lie that Eve would become like God (verse 5). But she and Adam learned by the hardway of experience to discern between <b>good and evil</b>. If they had then eaten of the tree of life, they would have lived forever in bodies subject to sickness, degeneration, and infirmity. Thus it was God's mercy that prevented them from returning to Eden. <b>Cherubim</b> are celestial creatures whose function is to "vindicate the holiness of God against the presumptous pride of fallen man.</p>

                        <p>Adam and Eve had to decide whether God or Satan was lying. They decided that God was. "Without faith it is imposible to please God." Thus their names are missing from the Honor Roll of Faith in <b>Hebrews 11</b>.</p>

                        <p>The ideal environment of Eden did not prevent the entrance of sin. A favorable environment is not the answer to man's problems.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

                        <p><sup id="4:1">4:1</sup> <b>Adam knew Eve his wife</b> in the sense that he had sexual relations with her. When <b>Cain</b> was born, she acknowledge that this birth was only by the Lord's enablement. In naming him <b>Cain</b> ("acquisition"), Eve may have thought that she had given birth to the Promised Seed.</p>

                        <p><sup>4:2-6</sup> <b>The process of time</b> mentioned in verse 3a allows for a considerable increase in the world's population. There must have been time when <b>Cain</b> and <b>Abel</b> were instructed that sinful man can approach the holy God only on the ground of the blood of a substitutionary sacrifice. Cain rejected this revelation and came with a bloodless offering of fruits and vegetables. Abel believe the divine decree and offered slain animals, thus demonstrating his faith and his justification by God (Hebrew 11:4). He brought  <b>the firstborn of his flock</b>, saying in effect the the <b>Lord</b> deserves the best. Abel's offering points forward to the substitutionary death of the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</p>

                        <p><sup>4:7</sup> Because Cain's jealous anger was incipient murder, God spoke to him in loving warning. Verse 7 may be understood in several ways:</p>

                            <ol style="font-size: 18px;">
                              <li><b>"If you do well</b> [by repenting], you will be able to look up again in freedom from anger and guilt. <b>If you do not do well</b> [by continuing to hate Abel], <b>sin</b> is crouching <b>at</b> your <b>door</b>, ready to destroy you. His [Abel's] <b>desire is for you</b> [i.e., he will acknowledge your leadership] and <b>you</b> will <b>rule over</b> him" [i.e., if you do well].</li>
                              <li><b>"If you do well</b> (or, as the Septuagint reads it, "If you offer  correctly") will you not be accepted?" The well-doing had reference to the offering. Abel did well by hiding himself behind an acceptable sacrifice. Cain did badly by bringing up offering without blood, and all his after-conduct was but the legitimate result of this false worship.</li>
                              <li>The RSV says, "If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it."</li>
                              <li>F.W. Grant says in his <i>Numerical Bible</i>, "If you do not well, a sin offering croucheth or lieth at the door. In other words, provision was made if he wanted it.</li>
                            </ol>

                        <p><sup>4:8-12</sup> Cain's evil attitude of jealous rage was soon translated into evil action, the murder of <b>his brother</b>. Though Abel is dead, he still witnesses to us that the life of faith is the life that counts (Hebrew 11:4). When the Lord's loving question was met by an unrepentant, insolent reply, He pronounced Cain's judgment - he would no longer be able to make a living from the soil, but would wonder as <b>a fugitive</b> in the desert. </p>

                        <p><sup>4:13-16</sup> Cain's whimpering complaint reveals remorse for the consequenses of his sin rather than for its guilt. But even then the Lord allayed the fugitive's fears for his life by putting a protective <b>mark on Cain</b> and a curse on anyone who killed him. <b>Cain went out from the presence of the Lord</b>, the saddest of all departures.</p>
