                      In recent days, as we continue to read and reflect on the Word of God, I have learned many things through devotion that have transformed my life. Initially, I thought that being kind, helpful to others, and not doing harm was enough to ensure my place in heaven. However, I realized that these actions alone are not sufficient in the eyes of God. What is truly needed is genuine faith in Him, acknowledging Him as the King and Savior of my life, loving Him wholly, and having an intimate relationship with Him.<br><br>
    
                      I have surrendered all my worries to God, and in doing so, I have felt the peace in my heart and mind. As God says, "Cast all your burdens on Me and I will give you rest." Concerning financial matters, I trust in His promise from Philippians 4:19 that He will supply all our needs according to His riches in glory by Christ.<br><br>
    
                      Even if I can only give a little to those in need, it brings me great joy and lightens my heart.<br><br>
                    
                      I love You, Lord. Amen.

              1. As children of God, it is essential for us to be immersed in His presence, as this will give us the strength to face any challenges that come our way. We should be prayerful and always study His Word, especially in our busy lives. It's important to set aside time for God despite our hectic schedules. <br><br>

              2. I acknowledge that this daily devotion program of the Kingdom of God has been a significant part of my spiritual growth. It has restored and strengthened my relationship with God. Even though my spouse and I, as servants of God, went through severe trials where we felt forgotten by Him and our prayers seemed unanswered, and despite the heavens appearing closed, the daily study and reading of His Word were our routine. Yet, through this devotion program, I experienced a profound power and presence of God. It allowed me to truly pour out the contents of my heart to Him, and I lost interest in watching TV or browsing Facebook and YouTube. 
              <br><br>

              3. Therefore, as we engage in devotion, let us seek intimacy with God, communicate with Him earnestly, and remain humble. I believe that He is the God who will perform great and marvelous things.

                  In my daily devotion, I have found it to be a crucial opportunity in my life. It has brought me closer to God. Previously, I only occasionally participated in spiritual activities. Now, with daily devotion, I initially struggled because I seldom read the Word of God, and reflecting on it was challenging. However, with the guidance of the Lord, I was able to move past these difficulties. Eventually, I became excited and joyful about the devotion. It has transformed my attitude, especially my tendency to nag my husband. I am grateful for daily devotion and, most of all, for our Lord, as it has significantly improved my attitudes. I have shared what I’ve learned from the verses through reflection and also with our family in our kingdom, sharing testimonies of how our lives have changed. <br><br>

                  I am deeply thankful for daily devotion and for God’s work in changing my undesirable attitudes.<br><br>

                  Thank You, Lord, for guiding us. In Jesus' mighty name, Amen.

                  When I first started my devotion, I didn't know much and didn't prioritize it. But as I continued with my devotions, I gradually became more motivated to participate. Even though there's no devotion on Sundays, my companions who attend church mentioned it, which encouraged me to stay committed. Now, I'm eager to continue our devotions. If we have relatives who attend church, let's invite them to get to know our Father more. We should encourage others in our churches to recognize the true God, and not worship idols, for they have eyes but cannot see, and feet but cannot walk. But our Father moves and speaks His words, so we should worship Him alone and acknowledge Him as our only God. That's all I have to say.
