                  When I first started my devotion, I didn't know much and didn't prioritize it. But as I continued with my devotions, I gradually became more motivated to participate. Even though there's no devotion on Sundays, my companions who attend church mentioned it, which encouraged me to stay committed. Now, I'm eager to continue our devotions. If we have relatives who attend church, let's invite them to get to know our Father more. We should encourage others in our churches to recognize the true God, and not worship idols, for they have eyes but cannot see, and feet but cannot walk. But our Father moves and speaks His words, so we should worship Him alone and acknowledge Him as our only God. That's all I have to say.

              Since I started my devotion, I've noticed how much the Daily Devotional has brought about positive changes and helped transform my life. Before I joined or participated in this Bible Study Group, I often spent my time playing mobile games, watching TikTok, or scrolling through Facebook and Instagram. But when I was invited to start doing devotions, I realized how little I knew about many important things. As I continued with my devotions, I began to understand the true meaning of each verse and realized how much more I needed to learn about following God. <br><br>
              
              I feel incredibly fortunate to have joined and participated in these fellowships, Bible studies, and devotions. This is also a reminder for us that if we want others to experience what we are feeling and achieving through our devotion, why not invite them to join us so they can also experience the same? My devotion has had a significant impact on my life—not only am I learning, but I am also growing in faith, deepening spiritually, and becoming more knowledgeable about God and closer to Him.

                  Because of this program, my perspective and approach to life have changed, and my daily routine has been transformed. Although there were times when I felt discouraged and considered leaving the program because my peers had left, a part of me felt I needed to stay. At first, I didn’t know what I was doing, and I received some criticism. Instead of taking it negatively, I used it as motivation to take the program seriously and prayed for understanding and wisdom from God. <br><br>
                  
                  I saw significant improvement and was overjoyed to find that I was the only one who grasped the point of the verse Matthew 25:3-13, which meant that I had truly progressed. I didn’t expect to come this far and wondered if I could continue when I went to college, as I had heard testimonies that college often leads people away from God. I am grateful that I didn’t leave the program. It has not only helped me spiritually and deepened my connection and knowledge of the Lord, but it has also been a source of comfort, as it seems to understand what I am going through spiritually. Through this program, I developed a personal devotion, and the fire in my heart was reignited. I am very thankful to the Lord for this opportunity.

                  God has been incredibly good in every aspect of my life. Since I started daily devotion, I can't count on my fingers and toes all the things He has done for me and my family. Little by little, He has transformed my lifestyle and behavior. Most importantly, my faith has become stronger, and I find joy in my heart when I read and listen to His Word. Previously, I would spend my time watching Korean dramas and other videos on social media, but the Lord gradually removed these distractions from my life. Even my worries about finances, bills, and allowances have been addressed by God. <br><br>

                I now appreciate even the small things more than before, whereas I used to complain. God has transformed my behavior remarkably. There is so much to be thankful for. Even now, I cannot contain the joy, happiness, and delight in my heart because God's love is incomparable. I continue to praise Your Holy Name, O God. All the glory belongs to You.🙏

              Brothers and sisters, I used to be someone with a stubborn and rebellious nature. I was the type who pretended to be a Christian, serving God but quickly returning to my old ways of drinking and neglecting Bible reading after church. However, the impact of this devotion program in the Kingdom has been immense in my life. When I first joined, I was very resistant and reluctant to follow their invitations, even setting my own terms for when I would be available. But I was told that I needed to humble myself and leave behind everything I knew, so I decided to give it a try. <br><br>
              
              After a few days of reading what was assigned to me, I initially felt indifferent, but over time, as I delved deeper into the readings, I felt that everything was becoming clearer to me. God showed me how humble I am, just dust, yet He lifted me from the dust and carried me with His hands. I realized that God can make me special, even though I came from something as insignificant as dust. When you place your life in God's hands, He gradually transforms you, and you can feel His excitement and desire to see you return to Him through a deeper relationship with His Word and through this devotion. <br><br>
              
              In the blink of an eye, the person who once had little regard for serving God, who was a drinker and only came to the front to play music, is now standing at the forefront, delivering God's message to others. This change came because of my devotion and seriousness in following it. No matter what happens, I would not trade the riches I have found in this experience. God's kingdom, which He has given me, is far more valuable than worldly wealth. <br><br>
              
              I used to sit at the back of the church, but now I stand at the front, teaching and sharing God's message with people. The best part is that my focus has shifted from material wealth and luxury to heavenly aspirations.

                Before I joined the devotion program, I had a strong desire to be used by God but didn’t know where or how to start, as I wasn’t actively participating in any religious activities, whether in Manila or Isabela. I am truly blessed that people reached out to me and introduced me to this devotion program. While I am still in the process of living out God’s teachings, here are a few of my wins with Him:<br><br>

                BEFORE: I wanted to be part of God’s movement on earth but wasn’t involved in any religious activities. I wanted to serve God but had not taken any actions to be used by Him.<br><br>

                NOW: I am gradually becoming active in movements that promote a relationship with God rather than just religion. For example, I now participate in "kamustahan" sessions.<br><br>

                BEFORE: I wanted to evangelize, invite, or share the Good News with others but wasn’t reading the Bible. I claimed to be a Born Again Christian but knew only a few Bible verses, which made me hesitant to share.<br><br>

                NOW: Since joining the devotion program, I’ve become bold and courageous in sharing the Good News with others by sharing my experiences and those of others involved in the program. I feel joy when new invitees experience God’s unique presence in their lives. Previously, my limited knowledge of the Bible and distance from my close friends were barriers to inviting others. But through the devotion program, I’ve reached out even to those far away to introduce them to God.<br><br>

                BEFORE: I knew little about God. I attended Sunday services but only remembered the sermon, not the Bible verses. I satisfied my spiritual hunger only on Sundays or when I saw posts on social media.<br><br>

                NOW: I am now spiritually nourished every day. I have a clearer understanding of what is right and wrong according to God. I am reminded to have genuine obedience and worship, rather than just accumulating knowledge of God’s Word.<br><br>

                BEFORE: I only remembered God when I was happy or needed Him, especially during problems.<br><br>

                NOW: I have learned to thank God even for the smallest things and not just remember Him when I need something. Slowly, I am learning to be content with life. I now have a conviction when I think, do, or say things that are not fitting for God. Although I still have many flaws, I am learning to bring my weaknesses to Him because I know I cannot change myself; only He can. I have rediscovered the act of kneeling before God, not because someone told me to, but because I know I am a sinner and need to plead for His forgiveness.<br><br>

                I pray that more people will draw closer to God through the Kingdom Chronicles devotion program. I hope that God touches us all to support and aid the needs of this program because what we have experienced are the fruits of it. God desires true servants, not just in words but through heart and actions.

              1. As children of God, it is essential for us to be immersed in His presence, as this will give us the strength to face any challenges that come our way. We should be prayerful and always study His Word, especially in our busy lives. It's important to set aside time for God despite our hectic schedules. <br><br>

              2. I acknowledge that this daily devotion program of the Kingdom of God has been a significant part of my spiritual growth. It has restored and strengthened my relationship with God. Even though my spouse and I, as servants of God, went through severe trials where we felt forgotten by Him and our prayers seemed unanswered, and despite the heavens appearing closed, the daily study and reading of His Word were our routine. Yet, through this devotion program, I experienced a profound power and presence of God. It allowed me to truly pour out the contents of my heart to Him, and I lost interest in watching TV or browsing Facebook and YouTube. 
              <br><br>

              3. Therefore, as we engage in devotion, let us seek intimacy with God, communicate with Him earnestly, and remain humble. I believe that He is the God who will perform great and marvelous things.

              You know, since I started joining in the devotionals, I've noticed some changes in myself. I've learned to be more calm because I used to be easily angered. Even the smallest things would set me off, and I'd get irritated even when no one had done anything wrong to me. This was probably due to the stress and numerous problems at work and in my personal life, which made me irritable. But now, that's changed. I've gradually learned to calm myself in different situations. Not everything needs to be handled with anger. It's better to understand the situation or problem first and then come up with a solution. If you prioritize anger, nothing good will come of it. <br><br>
              
              I've also started avoiding stressful situations. My patience and understanding have grown, and I now choose to remain silent to prevent situations from escalating or to end them quickly. I don't want to say hurtful things that I'll only regret later.<br><br>

              Before, I didn't really know God that well. Yes, I went to church, but as the verses in the devotionals say, just because you go to church doesn't mean you'll be saved. I admit that I committed sins before, even though I attended church. But now, through daily devotions, I've come to know God more. I understand better how He wants me to change and do good. He reminds me of the consequences if I don't follow Him. And even with all the sins I've committed, God is still there, ready to understand and forgive me—as long as my repentance is genuine and heartfelt.<br><br>

              Now, when I reflect on my devotionals, I can say that, yes, my character has changed. I've come to know God more and have developed a relationship with Him. However, I feel that my faith isn't as deep as it could be because I know there are sins I've committed that I haven't faced yet. Maybe that's why my devotion isn't complete. But I know that I've changed in some ways. I just pray for God's guidance and that He gives me the strength to face the challenges I'm dealing with right now. <br><br>
              
              I want to achieve an ultimate change within myself, so I know I can face everything. Everything will be okay, and I'll overcome the trials that God has given me. I'll continue with my devotions because they bring me comfort when I pray. Thank you so much for this program, even though I belong to a different religion, you still accepted me.

                  Reflecting daily on the Word of God illuminates our lives and transforms our perspective on earth. The Lord desires that we trust Him with our lives with a humble heart. To attain the promised life of fulfillment and eternity, we must be the salt and light to everyone we encounter. Let us earnestly pray about our role in this world and not be swayed by worldly matters. Instead, let us seek true growth through daily meditation on God’s Word. <br><br>


                  My first journey in daily devotion has been immensely helpful. I’ve realized there’s so much more I need to learn about my life here on earth. Reading the Word of God has had a profound impact on me; I’ve developed a conviction. Previously, I was apathetic in prayer, but now I have a strong desire for spiritual nourishment. I used to wake up and go about my day without giving thanks or praying, but since joining the daily devotion program, I’ve felt a renewed urgency to pray both morning and evening for our protection. Sometimes, God's Word can be challenging, fearful, or joyful, but the Holy Spirit helps us understand that we should never be afraid because God corrects our wrong perspectives. <br><br>
                  
                  Amen, thank God.

                  In my journey through daily devotion, I have experienced a range of emotions and challenges that sometimes weaken my faith in God. Due to the demands of daily life, there are moments when I struggle to keep up with my devotion schedule, among other reasons.<br><br>

                  Nevertheless, I am deeply grateful and humble before our Lord God because, despite my shortcomings and mistakes, I still feel His holy presence through His responses to my prayers and requests.<br><br>
                  
                  Now that I am engaged in a new level of daily devotion, I need to continually seek the guidance and help of the Holy Spirit to ensure that my actions and decisions align with God's will. I pray that He helps me follow His commandments consistently so that I do not regret my actions later and that I can guide others who may have lost their way. May He give me the strength to overcome all challenges daily. Amen.<br><br>

                  Once again, I express my heartfelt thanks for the goodness and love of our Father. In Jesus' name, Amen. 🙏 ♥️

                  During the first set of daily devotions, I felt immense joy because I was constantly in the presence of the Lord God and the Holy Spirit, who guides and provides anointing and proper reflection based on the daily verses. If you are already participating in devotion, continue with it because it shapes and matures our faith, making us resilient against any problems that arise. With God's presence, we will not be forsaken or abandoned. Trust in God, as He has called and chosen us for His Kingdom on this earth through His Kingdom program. We are among those who will enter the prepared place for those who follow and submit to His will. Whatever tasks are assigned to us in this devotion, let us obey and support the Kingdom of the Lord. For the promise of the Lord is that those who persevere to the end will inherit His promises. Amen. All glory belongs to our God.

                        The Kingdom Devotional program is a significant opportunity for everyone if embraced and participated in. First, while many of us previously engaged in devotion only once a day, this program encourages daily commitment, both in the morning and afternoon. We now focus on devotion regularly, including creating reflections. Unlike before, where devotion was more about contemplating God's words, this program incorporates social media to share reflections widely, fostering growth and gaining knowledge from the insights of others involved in spiritual development. <br><br>

                        Moreover, this program requires dedicating time to follow its guidelines, which aids in mentorship. As more people join and spread the word, the impact of the program grows, creating a vibrant community where everyone fears God and upholds His righteousness. Each member understands their responsibilities and builds a direct relationship with God. Our collective goal is to serve others and, above all, to serve God, leading to meaningful transformation.

                      As a believer, my greatest testimony is being chosen to study God's Word. In a world with so many people, I consider myself fortunate to be among the blessed. I’m grateful that my spouse and I can engage in daily devotion and reflections together.<br><br>

                      Through the devotion program provided by the Kingdom, I’ve learned discipline. Whereas before I struggled to keep to a devotion schedule, now I maintain a routine every morning. <br><br>
                      
                      Our commitment is to have devotion at 6 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. We honor this covenant with the Lord, meeting Him at these times. I believe that through our approach, even when we are in the car or facing obstacles, our faith and trust in God remain steadfast. Despite life's challenges, I find comfort knowing that the living God is with us and that devotion requires a genuine and consistent commitment.<br><br>

                  In recent days, as we continue to read and reflect on the Word of God, I have learned many things through devotion that have transformed my life. Initially, I thought that being kind, helpful to others, and not doing harm was enough to ensure my place in heaven. However, I realized that these actions alone are not sufficient in the eyes of God. What is truly needed is genuine faith in Him, acknowledging Him as the King and Savior of my life, loving Him wholly, and having an intimate relationship with Him.<br><br>

                  I have surrendered all my worries to God, and in doing so, I have felt the peace in my heart and mind. As God says, "Cast all your burdens on Me and I will give you rest." Concerning financial matters, I trust in His promise from Philippians 4:19 that He will supply all our needs according to His riches in glory by Christ.<br><br>

                  Even if I can only give a little to those in need, it brings me great joy and lightens my heart.<br><br>
                
                  I love You, Lord. Amen.

                        In my daily devotion, I have found it to be a crucial opportunity in my life. It has brought me closer to God. Previously, I only occasionally participated in spiritual activities. Now, with daily devotion, I initially struggled because I seldom read the Word of God, and reflecting on it was challenging. However, with the guidance of the Lord, I was able to move past these difficulties. Eventually, I became excited and joyful about the devotion. It has transformed my attitude, especially my tendency to nag my husband. I am grateful for daily devotion and, most of all, for our Lord, as it has significantly improved my attitudes. I have shared what I’ve learned from the verses through reflection and also with our family in our kingdom, sharing testimonies of how our lives have changed. <br><br>

                        I am deeply thankful for daily devotion and for God’s work in changing my undesirable attitudes.<br><br>

                        Thank You, Lord, for guiding us. In Jesus' mighty name, Amen.
