              Through my daily Bible devotion, I have come to care deeply for my country, the Philippines. Each day as I immerse myself in the Scriptures, my heart breaks for the suffering and hardship faced by our people. The poverty, the natural disasters, and the socio-economic struggles are overwhelming, and I often find myself crying out to God in anguish.<br><br>

              In these quiet moments of reflection, I am struck by how much God cares for our nation. The Bible reassures me that even in our darkest hours, His love and compassion are unwavering. It’s through this profound connection with God that I have come to see the Philippines not just as a land of trials, but as a place of immense hope and potential.<br><br>

              I am moved to tears by the thought that God has a divine plan for us, and He will use His people to bring about change. I believe with all my heart that our country, despite its current suffering, is held close to God's heart and is destined for renewal. My devotion has inspired me to act with greater empathy and commitment, trusting that through our collective faith and God's guidance, we will see our nation heal and flourish. My prayers are filled with both sorrow for the struggles and hope for the miraculous transformation that God will bring.

              First message: Our country was once highly regarded by other nations as one of the wealthiest in Asia. It fell due to corruption among its leaders and a lack of love for the nation, with people acting out of self-interest. The essence of the story is to love your country and God. 
              <br><br>
                  
              Second message: To revive the nation, only God can bring about this restoration. We must not be selfish; instead, let us love our country and our fellow Filipinos. 
              <br><br>
                  
              Third message: God has called our nation, with the blood of our ancestors flowing through us. God has chosen some of our fellow countrymen in the church to help restore the people to Him. The songs we hear are happening in our nation, and that’s why Kingdom Chronicles was established—to teach us to love God and our fellow human beings. We are the instruments through which our fellow countrymen can come to know God and enter His Kingdom, or join the Kingdom Chronicles. 
              <br><br>
                  
              Final message: The song of the nation, appointed by God, declares that Yahweh alone is our God. We are blessed to be part of Kingdom Chronicles, where God’s chosen ones begin their journey. Everything we learn should be shared with our fellow countrymen. From our nation will come those sent around the world to deliver God’s message (Christian sending nation), and our country will become the food basket of all Asia. We need to pray that all our loved ones can join us in Kingdom Chronicles.

                  It is truly overwhelming and awe-inspiring to witness the works of God among those who have completed their journey. I never imagined how profoundly blessed the events unfolding in our country would be. I’ve recently come to understand that the Philippines is chosen, refined, and tested. The prophetic songs that unify everyone in worship are also incredibly uplifting and encouraging.

          RISE, PHILIPPINES... <br><br>

            In our country, there is a lack of unity and concern for others, which is painful to see. It's as if the attitude is "pull your own tail," with little regard for fellow citizens. <br><br>

            In the 1950s and 1960s, the Philippines was one of the wealthiest nations in Asia, known as the "Pearl of the Orient Seas" due to its riches. The term "kayumanggi," which means "pure" and "wise," reflected the nation's esteemed position. <br><br>

            However, it's disheartening to see how our country has fallen. Once admired by many nations, the Philippines is now struggling, losing its dignity. The meaning of "Philippines" has changed to "domestic helper," and we are now one of the poorest countries in Asia, highly polluted and corrupt. <br><br>

            Comparatively, South Korea, once devastated after the war with North Korea, faced extreme poverty and hunger. The Korean president, despite being rejected for loans by other nations, was eventually helped by Germany. With this support, Korea rebuilt, creating factories and jobs. They invested in their people and fostered unity and love for their country. <br><br>

            In contrast, in the Philippines, there is a lack of unity and concern. Filipinos have become self-centered, indifferent to the plight of others, including the less fortunate who beg on the streets, are impoverished, and lack basic necessities. <br><br>

            Where is the "Pearl of the Orient" now, once a rich and esteemed nation in Asia? <br><br>

            Philippines, wake up and rise! Only God can lift our nation from its struggles. He alone knows our origins and our future path. Let us unite, love one another, and return to God, as He promises, "Return to Me and I will return to you... Seek My face and I will heal your land." <br><br>

            If we love God, we should also love our country. <br><br>

            Young people, the hope of our nation, and all Filipinos, let us unite and proclaim God's will to the world through the Kingdom Chronicle.
