            <h1>The Kingdom of God</h1>
            It’s Essence and it's application
        </center> <br>
    
<p> Introduction: <br>
      The Gospels say that Jesus preached the message of the Kingdom wherever He went. Therefore, the message about the Kingdom of God is the very essence of Jesus ministry. <br><br>

      The message of the Kingdom of God represents the whole understanding and manifestation of God’s heart for all people, tribes, tongues, and the nations of the world. <br><br>

      The Kingdom of God is not just a component of Christian faith; it is the very foundation of faith. <br><br>

      The one who understands the Kingdom of God possesses the real essence and practice of their faith in God. <br><br>

      Having the right understanding of the Kingdom of God provides a solid foundation about God and will lead to a lifestyle of victorious faith.

     <h2>I.  The Kingdom of God Under the Ruler-ship of Mankind</h2>

     
     <p>Dominion over all creation was given to Adam while he walked in close intimacy with God.</p>

     
     <p>1. In Genesis 1 and 2, we see God creating the heavens and the earth. The word used in Genesis 2 for "create" is "bara," which speaks of God’s power to create with just a thought.</p>

     <ul>
      <li>a.  The imagery is of God speaking the waters, stars, and wildlife into existence from His 	heavenly throne.</li>
      <li>b. And, if you remember in the creation story, of each thing God creates, He says, “and God 	saw that it was good”.</li>
      <li>c. However, the word for "create" used when God creates Adam is different. Here, the word 	is "yatsar," which means to form or fashion.
      <ul>
        <li>Unlike creating from His throne in heaven, God is now intimately engaged, like a 	potter forming a beautiful jar of clay. He breathes life into Adam.</li>
        <li>And only now does the text say, “and God saw it was very good”.</li>
      </ul></li>
     </ul>
