                <p><b>Steve Jobs</b><br> 
                  "I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others' eyes, my life is the epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. Ultimately, my wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on my bed and recalling my life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in have paled and become meaningless in the face of my death."
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Alexander the Great</b><br> 
                  When the great King fell ill, which led him to his deathbed. He gathered his generals and told them, "I will depart from this world soon; I have three wishes, please carry them out without fail."<br><br>

                  The king asked his general to abide by these last wishes:
                </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>The king of Macedon said, “My physicians alone must carry my coffin.”</li>
                      <li>"I desire that when my coffin is transported to the grave, the path leading to the graveyard will display the wealth I collected," the king said.</li>
                      <li>"My third and last wish is that both my hands hang out of my coffin," Alexander said.</li>
                    </ol>
    
                <p>The generals agreed to abide by their king's last wishes and asked him why he was doing so. Alexander said, "I want the world to know the three lessons I have just learned."<br><br>
                   The king interpreted his wishes and continued,</p>
    
                    <ul>
                      <li>"I want my physicians to carry my coffin because people should realize that no doctor can cure anybody. They are helpless in front of death."</li>
                      <li>The king described his second wish: "I spent all my life earning riches but cannot take anything with me. Let people know that wealth is nothing but dust."</li>
                      <li>Thirdly, I wish all to know that I came empty-handed into this world, and I will go empty-handed."</li>
                    </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>King Solomon</b><br> 
                  God gave Solomon wisdom—the deepest of understanding a man could ever have. <br><br>
                  There was nothing beyond him, nothing he couldn't handle. Solomon's wisdom outclassed the vaunted wisdom of wise men of the East and outshone the famous wisdom of Egypt.<br><br>
                   He was wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, wiser than Heman, wiser than Calcol, and Darda the sons of Mahol.<br><br> 
                   He became famous among all the surrounding nations. He created 3,000 proverbs; his songs added up to 1,005. <br><br>
                   He knew all about plants, from the huge cedar that grows in Lebanon to the tiny hyssop that grows in the cracks of a wall.<br><br> 
                   He understood everything about animals and birds, reptiles and fish.<br><br>
                    Sent by kings from all over the earth who had heard of his reputation, people came from far and near to listen to the wisdom of Solomon.<br><br>

      <p>2 Timothy 4:6-8</p>

      <ul>
        <li>NIV
          <ul>
              <li>6 For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near. 
              </li>
              <li>7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. </li>
              <li>8 Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Amplified Version
          <ul>
            <li>6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure from this world is at hand and I will soon go free. 
            </li>
            <li>7 I have fought the good and worthy and noble fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith firmly guarding the gospel against error.</li>
            <li>8 In the future there is reserved for me the victor's crown of righteousness for being right with God and doing right, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that great day—and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved and longed for and welcomed His appearing.</li>

      <p class="keyPoints">III. A Spiritual Truth that All People Should Know</p>

      <ul>
        <li>This earthly life is not our ultimate life, but we are all destined for eternity. Either we spend our life in torment or be with our Creator for all eternity.</li>
        <li>Our life on earth is our chance to live our life either of the two in eternity.  We can not say or choose where we want to spend our eternity. Because what will determine our eternity is how we spend our life here on earth.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li>
          <b>Matthew 25:46</b>:

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Revelation 20:10</b>:

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Revelation 20:15</b>:

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Revelation 14:11</b>:
          And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Revelation 21:8</b>:
          But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mark 8:36-38 AMP (Amplified Version)</b>:
          <sup>36</sup> For what does it benefit a man to gain the whole world [with all its pleasures], and forfeit his soul? <sup>37</sup> For what will a man give in exchange for his soul and eternal life [in God’s kingdom]? <sup>38</sup> For whoever is ashamed [here and now] of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.”<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Hebrews 9:27-28 NLT</b>:
          <sup>27</sup> And just as each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgment, <sup>28</sup> so also Christ was offered once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people. He will come again, not to deal with our sins, but to bring salvation to all who are eagerly waiting for him.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>John 10:10 AMP (Amplified Version)</b>:
          The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life, and have it in abundance [to the full, till it overflows].<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Matthew 11:28-30 AMP (Amplified Version)</b>:
          <sup>28</sup>  “Come to Me, all who are weary and heavily burdened [by religious rituals that provide no peace], and I will give you rest [refreshing your souls with salvation]. <sup>29</sup> Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me [following Me as My disciple], for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest (renewal, blessed quiet) for your souls. <sup>30</sup> For My yoke is easy [to bear] and My burden is light.”<br><br>
