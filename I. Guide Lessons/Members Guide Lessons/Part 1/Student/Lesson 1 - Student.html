        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b>Steve Jobs</b><br> 
              "I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others' eyes, my life is the epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. Ultimately, my wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on my bed and recalling my life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in have paled and become meaningless in the face of my death."
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Alexander the Great</b><br> 
              When the great King fell ill, which led him to his deathbed. He gathered his generals and told them, "I will depart from this world soon; I have three wishes, please carry them out without fail."<br><br>

              The king asked his general to abide by these last wishes:
            </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>“My physicians alone must carry my coffin.”</li>
                  <li>"I desire that when my coffin is transported to the grave, the path leading to the graveyard will display the wealth I collected," </li>
                  <li>"My third and last wish is that both my hands hang out of my coffin."</li>
                </ol>

            <p>The generals agreed to abide by their king's last wishes and asked him why he was doing so. Alexander said, "I want the world to know the three lessons I have just learned."<br><br>
               The king interpreted his wishes and continued,</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>"I want my physicians to carry my coffin because people should realize that no doctor can cure anybody. They are helpless in front of death."</li>
                  <li>The king described his second wish: "I spent all my life earning riches but cannot take anything with me. Let people know that wealth is nothing but dust."</li>
                  <li>Third, I wish all to know that I came empty-handed into this world, and I will go empty-handed."</li>
                </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>King Solomon</b><br> 
              God gave Solomon wisdom—the deepest of understanding a man could ever have. <br><br>
              There was nothing beyond his understanding or control. Solomon's wisdom surpassed that of the famed wise men of the East and outshone the esteemed wisdom of Egypt.<br><br>
              
               1. He was wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, wiser than Heman, wiser than Calcol, and Darda the sons of Mahol.<br><br> 

               <i>
               1 Kings 4:31 NIV <br>
               "He was wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite—wiser than Heman, Kalkol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding nations." 
              </i><br><br>

              Ethan the Ezrahite is mentioned in this passage as one of the wise men whose wisdom was surpassed by King Solomon. The verse highlights Solomon's exceptional wisdom by comparing it to that of other renowned wise men, including Ethan<br><br>

               2. He became renowned among all the neighboring nations, composing 3,000 proverbs and writing 1,005 songs. <br><br>

               3. He had extensive knowledge about plants, from the large cedars of Lebanon to the small hyssop that grows in the crevices of a wall.<br><br> 

               4. He had a comprehensive understanding of all creatures, including animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.<br><br>

              5. Kings from all over the earth, who had heard of his reputation, visited Solomon, and people traveled from near and far to hear his wisdom.<br><br>
