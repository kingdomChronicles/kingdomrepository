            <h1>A Question About Life Purpose</h1>
        </center>

        <p><b>Introduction:</b> <br>

          Many people may not fully recognize or live according to the life purpose that God has planned for them. Most people do not understand the true foundation of their life’s purpose.
        </p>
        
    
        <p class="keyPoints">I. Are you aware that the majority of people are not living according to the life purpose God has created for them?</p>
            <ol>
              <li>In your opinion, what is your purpose in life?</li>
              <li>Is our existence solely about being born, getting an education, securing a good job or starting a business, raising a family, and ultimately die.</li>
              <li>Are you aware that many individuals who are deemed successful by worldly standards often experience deep regrets in their old age or on their deathbed?</li>
            </ol>

        

        <p class="keyPoints">II. Life Lessons from Three Great Figures in the World.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Steve Jobs</b> - A billionaire, an American entrepreneur, inventor and a business magnate best known as the co-founder of Apple Inc.</li>
              <li><b>Alexander the Great</b> - was a Macedonian king and one of history's most successful military commanders, known for creating one of the largest empires in the ancient world. One of history's greatest conquerors, who conquered many kingdoms at a young age (20 y.o.) and conquered vast land in a short span of time.</li>
              <li><b>King Solomon</b>  - Known as one of the greatest kings in biblical history due to his wisdom, wealth and accomplishments.</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">These individuals are regarded as some of the most successful people in the world. Let’s explore their perspectives on life, death, and their accomplishments.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><b>Steve Jobs</b><br> 
                  "I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others' eyes, my life is the epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. Ultimately, my wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on my bed and recalling my life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in have paled and become meaningless in the face of my death."
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Alexander the Great</b><br> 
                  When the great King fell ill, which led him to his deathbed. He gathered his generals and told them, "I will depart from this world soon; I have three wishes, please carry them out without fail."<br><br>

                  The king asked his general to abide by these last wishes:
                </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>“My physicians alone must carry my coffin.”</li>
                      <li>"I desire that when my coffin is transported to the grave, the path leading to the graveyard will display the wealth I collected," </li>
                      <li>"My third and last wish is that both my hands hang out of my coffin."</li>
                    </ol>
    
                <p>The generals agreed to abide by their king's last wishes and asked him why he was doing so. Alexander said, "I want the world to know the three lessons I have just learned."<br><br>
                   The king interpreted his wishes and continued,</p>
    
                    <ol>
                      <li>"I want my physicians to carry my coffin because people should realize that no doctor can cure anybody. They are helpless in front of death."</li>
                      <li>The king described his second wish: "I spent all my life earning riches but cannot take anything with me. Let people know that wealth is nothing but dust."</li>
                      <li>Third, I wish all to know that I came empty-handed into this world, and I will leave this world empty-handed also."</li>
                    </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>King Solomon</b><br> 
                  God gave Solomon wisdom—the deepest of understanding a man could ever have. <br><br>
                  There was nothing beyond his understanding or control. Solomon's wisdom surpassed that of the famed wise men of the East and outshone the esteemed wisdom of Egypt.<br><br>
                  
                   1. He was wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, wiser than Heman, wiser than Kalkol, and Darda the sons of Mahol.<br><br> 

                   <i>
                   1 Kings 4:31 NIV <br>
                   "He was wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite—wiser than Heman, Kalkol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding nations." 
                  </i><br><br>

                  Ethan the Ezrahite is mentioned in this passage as one of the wise men whose wisdom was surpassed by King Solomon. The verse highlights Solomon's exceptional wisdom by comparing it to that of other renowned wise men, including Ethan<br><br>

                   2. He became renowned among all the neighboring nations, composing 3,000 proverbs and writing 1,005 songs. <br><br>

                   3. He had extensive knowledge about plants, from the large cedars of Lebanon to the small hyssop that grows in the crevices of a wall.<br><br> 

                   4. He had a comprehensive understanding of all creatures, including animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.<br><br>

                  5. Kings from all over the earth, who had heard of his reputation, visited Solomon, and people traveled from near and far to hear his wisdom.<br><br>

                  <b><i>Everything Is Meaningless</i></b><br><br>
                
                      1 These are the words of the Teacher, King David’s son, who ruled in Jerusalem.<br><br>

                      2 “Everything is meaningless,” says the Teacher, “completely meaningless!”<br><br>

                      3  What do people get for all their hard work under the sun?<br><br>
                      4 Generations come and generations go, but the earth never changes.<br><br>
                      5 The sun rises and the sun sets, then hurries around to rise again.<br><br>
                      6 The wind blows south, and then turns north. Around and around it goes, blowing in circles.<br><br>
                      7 Rivers run into the sea, but the sea is never full. Then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea.<br><br>
                      8 Everything is wearisome beyond description. No matter how much we see, we are never satisfied. No matter how much we hear, we are not content.<br><br>
                      9 History merely repeats itself. It has all been done before. Nothing under the sun is truly new.<br><br>
                      10 Sometimes people say, “Here is something new!” But actually it is old; nothing is ever truly new.<br><br>
                      11 We don’t remember what happened in the past, and in future generations, no one will remember what we are doing now.<br><br>

                      12 I, the Teacher, was king of Israel, and I lived in Jerusalem.<br><br>
                      13 I devoted myself to search for understanding and to explore by wisdom everything being done under heaven. I soon discovered that God has dealt a tragic existence to the human race.<br><br>
                      14 I observed everything going on under the sun, and really, it is all meaningless—like chasing the wind.<br><br>
                      15 What is wrong cannot be made right. What is missing cannot be recovered.<br><br>
                      16 I said to myself, “Look, I am wiser than any of the kings who ruled in Jerusalem before me. I have greater wisdom and knowledge than any of them.” <br><br>
                      17 So I set out to learn everything from wisdom to madness and folly. But I learned firsthand that pursuing all this is like chasing the wind.<br><br>
                      18 The greater my wisdom, the greater my grief. To increase knowledge only increases sorrow.

                <p><b>Ecclesiastes 2:1-11 (NLT)</b><br>
                  <b><i>The Futility of Pleasure</i></b><br><br>
                
                       1 I said to myself, “Come on, let’s try pleasure. Let’s look for the ‘good things’ in life.” But I found that this, too, was meaningless.<br><br>
                       2 So I said, “Laughter is silly. What good does it do to seek pleasure?”<br><br>
                       3 After much thought, I decided to cheer myself with wine. And while still seeking wisdom, I clutched at foolishness. In this way, I tried to experience the only happiness most people find during their brief life in this world.<br><br>
                      4 I also tried to find meaning by building huge homes for myself and by planting beautiful vineyards.<br><br>
                      5 I made gardens and parks, filling them with all kinds of fruit trees.<br><br>
                      6 I built reservoirs to collect the water to irrigate my many flourishing groves.<br><br>
                      7 I bought slaves, both men and women, and others were born into my household. I also owned large herds and flocks, more than any of the kings who had lived in Jerusalem before me.<br><br>
                      8 I collected great sums of silver and gold, the treasure of many kings and provinces. I hired wonderful singers, both men and women, and had many beautiful concubines. I had everything a man could desire!<br><br>
                      9 So I became greater than all who had lived in Jerusalem before me, and my wisdom never failed me.<br><br>
                      10 Anything I wanted, I would take. I denied myself no pleasure. I even found great pleasure in hard work, a reward for all my labors.<br><br>
                      11 But as I looked at everything I had worked so hard to accomplish, it was all so meaningless—like chasing the wind. There was nothing really worthwhile anywhere. <br><br>

                      </li>
                      <li>
          <p><b>Ecclesiastes 2:12-17 (NLT)</b><br>
            <b><i>The Wise and the Foolish</i></b><br><br>
            
                      12 So I decided to compare wisdom with foolishness and madness (for who can do this better than I, the king?).<br><br>
                      13 I thought, “Wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness.<br><br>
                      14 For the wise can see where they are going, but fools walk in the dark.” Yet I saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate.<br><br>
                      15 Both will die. So I said to myself, “Since I will end up the same as the fool, what’s the value of all my wisdom? This is all so meaningless!”<br><br>
                      16 For the wise and the foolish both die. The wise will not be remembered any longer than the fool. In the days to come, both will be forgotten.<br><br>
                      17 So I came to hate life because everything done here under the sun is so troubling. Everything is meaningless—like chasing the wind.<br><br>

</li>
<li>
        <p><b>Ecclesiastes 2:18-26 (NLT)</b><br>
          <b><i>The Futility of Work</i></b><br><br>
                     
                      18 I came to hate all my hard work here on earth, for I must leave to others everything I have earned.<br><br>
                      19 And who can tell whether my successors will be wise or foolish? Yet they will control everything I have gained by my skill and hard work under the sun. How meaningless!<br><br>
                      20 So I gave up in despair, questioning the value of all my hard work in this world.<br><br>
                      21 Some people work wisely with knowledge and skill, then must leave the fruit of their efforts to someone who hasn’t worked for it. This, too, is meaningless, a great tragedy.<br><br>
                      22  So what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety? <br><br>
                      23 Their days of labor are filled with pain and grief; even at night their minds cannot rest. It is all meaningless.<br><br>
                      24 So I decided there is nothing better than to enjoy food and drink and to find satisfaction in work. Then I realized that these pleasures are from the hand of God.<br><br>
                      25 For who can eat or enjoy anything apart from him?<br><br>
                      26 God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to those who please him. But if a sinner becomes wealthy, God takes the wealth away and gives it to those who please him. This, too, is meaningless—like chasing the wind.

                  <b><i>Remember God in your Youth</i></b><br><br>

                  1 Don’t let the excitement of youth cause you to forget your Creator. Honor him in your youth before you grow old and say, “Life is not pleasant anymore.”<br><br>
                  2 Remember him before the light of the sun, moon, and stars is dim to your old eyes, and rain clouds continually darken your sky.<br><br>
                  3 Remember him before your legs—the guards of your house—start to tremble; and before your shoulders—the strong men—stoop. Remember him before your teeth—your few remaining servants—stop grinding; and before your eyes—the women looking through the windows—see dimly.<br><br>
                  4 Remember him before the door to life’s opportunities is closed and the sound of work fades. Now you rise at the first chirping of the birds, but then all their sounds will grow faint.<br><br>
                  5 Remember him before you become fearful of falling and worry about danger in the streets; before your hair turns white like an almond tree in bloom, and you drag along without energy like a dying grasshopper, and the caperberry no longer inspires sexual desire. Remember him before you near the grave, your everlasting home, when the mourners will weep at your funeral.<br><br>
                  6 Yes, remember your Creator now while you are young, before the silver cord of life snaps and the golden bowl is broken. Don’t wait until the water jar is smashed at the spring and the pulley is broken at the well.<br><br>
                  7 For then the dust will return to the earth, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.<br><br>

                  8 “Everything is meaningless,” says the Teacher, “completely meaningless.”<br><br>
                  9 Keep this in mind: The Teacher was considered wise, and he taught the people everything he knew. He listened carefully to many proverbs, studying and classifying them.<br><br>
                  10 The Teacher sought to find just the right words to express truths clearly.<br><br>
                  11 The words of the wise are like cattle prods—painful but helpful. Their collected sayings are like a nail-studded stick with which a shepherd drives the sheep.<br><br>
                  12 But, my child, let me give you some further advice: Be careful, for writing books is endless, and much study wears you out.<br><br>
