        </center>

        <p><b>Pasimula:</b> <br>

          Maraming tao ang maaaring hindi lubos na nauunawaan o namumuhay ayon sa layunin ng buhay na inilaan ng Diyos para sa kanila. Karamihan ay hindi nauunawaan ang tunay na pundasyon ng kanilang layunin sa buhay.
        </p>
        
    
        <p class="keyPoints">I. Alam mo ba na karamihan sa mga tao ay hindi namumuhay ayon sa layunin ng buhay na nilikha ng Diyos para sa kanila?</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Sa iyong palagay, ano ang layunin(purpose) mo sa buhay?</li>
              <li>Ang ating buhay ba ay umiikot lamang sa pagsilang, pag-aaral, magkaroon ng magandang trabaho o magpasimula ng negosyo, pagpapalaki ng pamilya, at sa huli, ang kamatayan?</li>
              <li>Alam mo ba na maraming tao na itinuturing na matagumpay ayon sa mga pamantayan ng mundo ay madalas na nakararanas ng matinding pagsisisi sa kanilang katandaan o sa kanilang huling sandali sa buhay?</li>
            </ol>

        

        <p class="keyPoints">II. Mga Aral sa Buhay mula sa Tatlong Itinuturing na Dakilang Tao sa Mundo.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Steve Jobs</b> - Isang bilyonaryo, Amerikanong negosyante, imbentor, at magnate ng negosyo na kilala bilang co-founder ng Apple Inc.</li>
              <li><b>Alexander the Great</b> - Siya ay isang hari ng Macedonia at isa sa mga pinaka matagumpay na komander ng militar sa kasaysayan, na kilala sa paglikha ng isa sa pinakamalalaking imperyo sa sinaunang mundo. Isa sa mga pinakadakilang mananakop sa kasaysayan, na nasakop ang maraming kaharian sa murang edad (20 taong gulang) at mabilis na nakakuha ng malawak na lupain sa maikling panahon lamang.</li>
              <li><b>King Solomon</b>  - Kilala bilang isa sa mga pinakadakilang hari sa kasaysayan ng Bibliya dahil sa kanyang karunungan, yaman, at mga tagumpay.</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">Ang mga indibidwal na ito ay itinuturing na ilan sa mga pinaka matagumpay na tao sa mundo. Tuklasin natin ang kanilang pananaw sa buhay, ang kanilang mga tagumpay at kamatayan.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><b>Steve Jobs</b><br> 
                  "Nakarating ako sa rurok ng tagumpay sa mundo ng pagnegosyo. Sa mata ng iba, ang aking buhay ay ang huwaran ng tagumpay. Ngunit, bukod sa trabaho, kakaunti ang aking kaligayahan. Sa huli, ang aking kayamanan ay isa lamang katotohanan ng buhay na aking nakasanayan. Ngayong nakahiga ako sa aking kama at inaalala ang aking buhay, napagtanto ko na ang lahat ng pagkilala at kayamanan na lubos kong ipinagmamalaki ay kumupas na at naging walang saysay sa harap ng aking kamatayan."
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Alexander the Great</b><br> 
                  Nang magkasakit ang dakilang Hari, na nagdala sa kanya sa kanyang huling hantungan, tinipon niya ang kanyang mga heneral at sinabi, "Malapit na akong pumanaw mula sa mundong ito; may tatlo akong kahilingan, pakiusap, tuparin ninyo ang mga ito nang walang pagkukulang."<br><br>

                  Hiniling ng hari sa kanyang mga heneral na sundin ang mga huling kahilingang ito:
                </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>"Ang aking mga manggagamot lamang ang dapat magbuhat ng aking kabaong."</li>
                      <li>"Nais ko na kapag dinala ang aking kabaong patungo sa libingan, ang daan patungo sa aking libingan ay ilatag ang lahat ng kayamanang aking naipon." </li>
                      <li>"Ang aking ikatlo at huling hiling ay ang parehong kamay ko ay nakalaylay sa labas ng aking kabaong."</li>
                    </ol>
    
                <p>Sumang-ayon ang mga heneral na sundin ang huling mga hiling ng kanilang hari at tinanong siya kung bakit niya ito ginagawa. Sinabi ni Alexander, "Nais kong malaman ng mundo ang tatlong aral na kamakailan ko lang natutunan sa higaan ng aking nalalapit na kamatayan."<br><br>

                   Ipinaliwanag ng hari ang kanyang mga kahilingan at nagpatuloy,</p>
    
                    <ol>
                      <li>"Nais kong ang aking mga manggagamot ang magbuhat ng aking kabaong dahil nais kong maunawaan ng mga tao na walang doktor ang makakapigil sa kamatayan ng sinuman. Walang magagawa ang sinuman sa harap ng kamatayan."</li>
                      <li>Ikinuwento ng hari ang kanyang pangalawang hiling: "Inubos ko ang aking buhay sa pagkakamit ng yaman ngunit wala akong madadala sa kabilang buhay. Nais kong malaman ng mga tao na ang kayamanan ay walang iba kundi alikabok lamang."</li>
                      <li>"Pangatlo, nais kong malaman ng lahat na ako ay dumating sa mundong ito na walang dala, at aalis din ako mula sa mundong ito na walang dala."</li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Haring Solomon</b><br> 
                  Ibinigay ng Diyos kay Solomon ang karunungan—ang pinakamalalim na pang-unawa na maaring taglayin ng isang tao. <br><br>
                  Walang bagay na lampas sa kanyang pag-unawa o kontrol. Ang karunungan ni Solomon ay lumampas sa karunungan ng mga kilalang pantas mula sa Silangan at higit pa sa iginagalang na karunungan ng Egypto.<br><br>
                  
                   1. Siya ay mas marunong kaysa kay Ethan the Ezrahite, mas marunong kaysa kay Heman, mas marunong kaysa kina Kalkol at Darda, mga anak ni Mahol.<br><br> 

                   <i>
                    1 Mga Hari 4:31 MBB <br>
                    Mas marunong siya kaysa sinumang tao. Mas marunong siya kay Etan na mula sa angkan ni Ezra, at kina Heman, Calcol, Darda, na mga anak ni Machol. Naging tanyag siya sa lahat ng bansa sa paligid. 
                  </i><br><br>

                  Si Ethan the Ezrahite ay binanggit sa talatang ito bilang isa sa mga pantas na ang karunungan ay nalampasan ni Haring Solomon. Ang talata ay nagbibigay-diin sa pambihirang karunungan ni Solomon sa pamamagitan ng paghahambing nito sa karunungan ng iba pang kilalang pantas, kabilang si Ethan.<br><br>

                   2. Naging tanyag siya sa lahat ng mga kalapit na bansa, na nagkompos ng 3,000 talinghaga at sumulat ng 1,005 awit. <br><br>

                   3. Mayroon siyang malawak na kaalaman tungkol sa mga halaman, mula sa malalaking cedars ng Lebanon hanggang sa maliliit na hyssop na tumutubo sa mga siwang ng pader.<br><br> 

                   4. Mayroon siyang malawak na pag-unawa sa lahat ng mga nilalang, kabilang ang mga hayop, ibon, reptilya, at isda.<br><br>

                  5. Ang mga hari mula sa iba’t ibang panig ng mundo, na nakarinig ng kanyang reputasyon, ay bumisita kay Solomon, at ang mga tao mula sa malapit at malayo ay naglakbay upang marinig ang kanyang karunungan.<br><br>

                      1 These are the words of the Teacher, King David’s son, who ruled in Jerusalem.<br><br>

                      2 “Everything is meaningless,” says the Teacher, “completely meaningless!”<br><br>

                      3  What do people get for all their hard work under the sun?<br><br>
                      4 Generations come and generations go, but the earth never changes.<br><br>
                      5 The sun rises and the sun sets, then hurries around to rise again.<br><br>
                      6 The wind blows south, and then turns north. Around and around it goes, blowing in circles.<br><br>
                      7 Rivers run into the sea, but the sea is never full. Then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea.<br><br>
                      8 Everything is wearisome beyond description. No matter how much we see, we are never satisfied. No matter how much we hear, we are not content.<br><br>
                      9 History merely repeats itself. It has all been done before. Nothing under the sun is truly new.<br><br>
                      10 Sometimes people say, “Here is something new!” But actually it is old; nothing is ever truly new.<br><br>
                      11 We don’t remember what happened in the past, and in future generations, no one will remember what we are doing now.<br><br>

                      12 I, the Teacher, was king of Israel, and I lived in Jerusalem.<br><br>
                      13 I devoted myself to search for understanding and to explore by wisdom everything being done under heaven. I soon discovered that God has dealt a tragic existence to the human race.<br><br>
                      14 I observed everything going on under the sun, and really, it is all meaningless—like chasing the wind.<br><br>
                      15 What is wrong cannot be made right. What is missing cannot be recovered.<br><br>
                      16 I said to myself, “Look, I am wiser than any of the kings who ruled in Jerusalem before me. I have greater wisdom and knowledge than any of them.” <br><br>
                      17 So I set out to learn everything from wisdom to madness and folly. But I learned firsthand that pursuing all this is like chasing the wind.<br><br>
                      18 The greater my wisdom, the greater my grief. To increase knowledge only increases sorrow.

                  <b><i>The Futility of Pleasure</i></b><br><br>
                
                       1 I said to myself, “Come on, let’s try pleasure. Let’s look for the ‘good things’ in life.” But I found that this, too, was meaningless.<br><br>
                       2 So I said, “Laughter is silly. What good does it do to seek pleasure?”<br><br>
                       3 After much thought, I decided to cheer myself with wine. And while still seeking wisdom, I clutched at foolishness. In this way, I tried to experience the only happiness most people find during their brief life in this world.<br><br>
                      4 I also tried to find meaning by building huge homes for myself and by planting beautiful vineyards.<br><br>
                      5 I made gardens and parks, filling them with all kinds of fruit trees.<br><br>
                      6 I built reservoirs to collect the water to irrigate my many flourishing groves.<br><br>
                      7 I bought slaves, both men and women, and others were born into my household. I also owned large herds and flocks, more than any of the kings who had lived in Jerusalem before me.<br><br>
                      8 I collected great sums of silver and gold, the treasure of many kings and provinces. I hired wonderful singers, both men and women, and had many beautiful concubines. I had everything a man could desire!<br><br>
                      9 So I became greater than all who had lived in Jerusalem before me, and my wisdom never failed me.<br><br>
                      10 Anything I wanted, I would take. I denied myself no pleasure. I even found great pleasure in hard work, a reward for all my labors.<br><br>
                      11 But as I looked at everything I had worked so hard to accomplish, it was all so meaningless—like chasing the wind. There was nothing really worthwhile anywhere. <br><br>

          <p><b>Ecclesiastes 2:12-17 (NLT)</b><br>
            <b><i>The Wise and the Foolish</i></b><br><br>
            
                      12 So I decided to compare wisdom with foolishness and madness (for who can do this better than I, the king?).<br><br>
                      13 I thought, “Wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness.<br><br>
                      14 For the wise can see where they are going, but fools walk in the dark.” Yet I saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate.<br><br>
                      15 Both will die. So I said to myself, “Since I will end up the same as the fool, what’s the value of all my wisdom? This is all so meaningless!”<br><br>
                      16 For the wise and the foolish both die. The wise will not be remembered any longer than the fool. In the days to come, both will be forgotten.<br><br>
                      17 So I came to hate life because everything done here under the sun is so troubling. Everything is meaningless—like chasing the wind.<br><br>

</li>
<li>
        <p><b>Ecclesiastes 2:18-26 (NLT)</b><br>
          <b><i>The Futility of Work</i></b><br><br>
                     
                      18 I came to hate all my hard work here on earth, for I must leave to others everything I have earned.<br><br>
                      19 And who can tell whether my successors will be wise or foolish? Yet they will control everything I have gained by my skill and hard work under the sun. How meaningless!<br><br>
                      20 So I gave up in despair, questioning the value of all my hard work in this world.<br><br>
                      21 Some people work wisely with knowledge and skill, then must leave the fruit of their efforts to someone who hasn’t worked for it. This, too, is meaningless, a great tragedy.<br><br>
                      22  So what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety? <br><br>
                      23 Their days of labor are filled with pain and grief; even at night their minds cannot rest. It is all meaningless.<br><br>
                      24 So I decided there is nothing better than to enjoy food and drink and to find satisfaction in work. Then I realized that these pleasures are from the hand of God.<br><br>
                      25 For who can eat or enjoy anything apart from him?<br><br>
                      26 God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to those who please him. But if a sinner becomes wealthy, God takes the wealth away and gives it to those who please him. This, too, is meaningless—like chasing the wind.

                  1 Don’t let the excitement of youth cause you to forget your Creator. Honor him in your youth before you grow old and say, “Life is not pleasant anymore.”<br><br>
                  2 Remember him before the light of the sun, moon, and stars is dim to your old eyes, and rain clouds continually darken your sky.<br><br>
                  3 Remember him before your legs—the guards of your house—start to tremble; and before your shoulders—the strong men—stoop. Remember him before your teeth—your few remaining servants—stop grinding; and before your eyes—the women looking through the windows—see dimly.<br><br>
                  4 Remember him before the door to life’s opportunities is closed and the sound of work fades. Now you rise at the first chirping of the birds, but then all their sounds will grow faint.<br><br>
                  5 Remember him before you become fearful of falling and worry about danger in the streets; before your hair turns white like an almond tree in bloom, and you drag along without energy like a dying grasshopper, and the caperberry no longer inspires sexual desire. Remember him before you near the grave, your everlasting home, when the mourners will weep at your funeral.<br><br>
                  6 Yes, remember your Creator now while you are young, before the silver cord of life snaps and the golden bowl is broken. Don’t wait until the water jar is smashed at the spring and the pulley is broken at the well.<br><br>
                  7 For then the dust will return to the earth, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.<br><br>

                  8 “Everything is meaningless,” says the Teacher, “completely meaningless.”<br><br>
                  9 Keep this in mind: The Teacher was considered wise, and he taught the people everything he knew. He listened carefully to many proverbs, studying and classifying them.<br><br>
                  10 The Teacher sought to find just the right words to express truths clearly.<br><br>
                  11 The words of the wise are like cattle prods—painful but helpful. Their collected sayings are like a nail-studded stick with which a shepherd drives the sheep.<br><br>
                  12 But, my child, let me give you some further advice: Be careful, for writing books is endless, and much study wears you out.<br><br>

            <li>6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure from this world is at hand and I will soon go free. 
            </li>
            <li>7 I have fought the good and worthy and noble fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith firmly guarding the gospel against error.</li>
            <li>8 In the future there is reserved for me the victor's crown of righteousness for being right with God and doing right, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that great day—and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved and longed for and welcomed His appearing.</li>

      <p class="keyPoints">IV. A Spiritual Truth that Everyone Should Know and Understand</p>

      <ul>
        <li>This earthly life is not our ultimate existence; instead, we are all destined for eternity. We will either spend eternity in torment or in the presence of our Creator.</li>
        <li>Our time on earth is the opportunity to shape, prepare and choice of our eternal destiny. We cannot choose where we will spend eternity after our life here. </li>
        <li>What will determine our eternal fate is how we live our lives on earth.</li>
      </ul>
