            <h1>A Question About Life Purpose</h1>
        </center>
    
        <p class="keyPoints">I. Are you aware that most people are not living according to the life purpose that God has designed for them?</p>
            <ol>
              <li>In your opinion, what is your purpose in life?</li>
              <li>Are we simply meant to be born, get an education, find a good job or start a business, have a family, and then eventually die??</li>
              <li>Did you know that many people who are considered successful by worldly standards often have significant regrets in their old age or on their deathbed?</li>
            </ol>

        

        <p class="keyPoints">II. Life Lessons from Three Great Figures in the World.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Steve Jobs</b> - A billionaire and co-founder of Apple.</li>
              <li><b>Alexander the Great</b> - One of history's greatest conquerors, who conquered many kingdoms at a young age in a short span of time.</li>
              <li><b>King Solomon</b>  - Known as the greatest king, the richest king in history, and the wisest man to ever live.</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">These individuals are considered some of the most successful people in the world. Let’s examine what they have to say about life, death, and their achievements.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><b>Steve Jobs</b><br> 
                  "I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others' eyes, my life is the epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. Ultimately, my wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on my bed and recalling my life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in have paled and become meaningless in the face of my death."
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Alexander the Great</b><br> 
                  When the great King fell ill, which led him to his deathbed. He gathered his generals and told them, "I will depart from this world soon; I have three wishes, please carry them out without fail."<br><br>

                  The king asked his general to abide by these last wishes:
                </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>“My physicians alone must carry my coffin.”</li>
                      <li>"I desire that when my coffin is transported to the grave, the path leading to the graveyard will display the wealth I collected," </li>
                      <li>"My third and last wish is that both my hands hang out of my coffin."</li>
                    </ol>
    
                <p>The generals agreed to abide by their king's last wishes and asked him why he was doing so. Alexander said, "I want the world to know the three lessons I have just learned."<br><br>
                   The king interpreted his wishes and continued,</p>
    
                    <ul>
                      <li>"I want my physicians to carry my coffin because people should realize that no doctor can cure anybody. They are helpless in front of death."</li>
                      <li>The king described his second wish: "I spent all my life earning riches but cannot take anything with me. Let people know that wealth is nothing but dust."</li>
                      <li>Third, I wish all to know that I came empty-handed into this world, and I will go empty-handed."</li>
                    </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>King Solomon</b><br> 
                  God gave Solomon wisdom—the deepest of understanding a man could ever have. <br><br>
                  There was nothing beyond his understanding or control. Solomon's wisdom surpassed that of the famed wise men of the East and outshone the esteemed wisdom of Egypt.<br><br>
                  
                   1. He was wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, wiser than Heman, wiser than Calcol, and Darda the sons of Mahol.<br><br> 

                   <i>
                   1 Kings 4:31 NIV <br>
                   "He was wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite—wiser than Heman, Kalkol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding nations." 
                  </i><br><br>

                  Ethan the Ezrahite is mentioned in this passage as one of the wise men whose wisdom was surpassed by King Solomon. The verse highlights Solomon's exceptional wisdom by comparing it to that of other renowned wise men, including Ethan<br><br>

                   2. He became renowned among all the neighboring nations, composing 3,000 proverbs and writing 1,005 songs. <br><br>

                   3. He had extensive knowledge about plants, from the large cedars of Lebanon to the small hyssop that grows in the crevices of a wall.<br><br> 

                   4. He had a comprehensive understanding of all creatures, including animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.<br><br>

                  5. Kings from all over the earth, who had heard of his reputation, visited Solomon, and people traveled from near and far to hear his wisdom.<br><br>

                  Let's learn Solomon's Reflection about Life?<br><br>
                  Ecclesiastes Chapters 1, 2, and 12
                    </p>
                            

             <ul>
              <li>
                <p><b>Ecclesiastes 1:1-18 (NIV)</b><br>
                  <b>Everything Is Meaningless</b><br>
                
                      1 The words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem:<br><br>

                      2 “Meaningless! Meaningless!”<br>
                          says the Teacher.<br>
                      “Utterly meaningless!<br>
                          Everything is meaningless.”<br><br>

                      3 What do people gain from all their labors<br>
                          at which they toil under the sun?<br><br>
                      4 Generations come and generations go,<br>
                          but the earth remains forever.<br><br>
                      5 The sun rises and the sun sets,<br>
                          and hurries back to where it rises.<br><br>
                      6 The wind blows to the south<br>
                          and turns to the north;<br>
                      round and round it goes,<br>
                          ever returning on its course.<br><br>
                      7 All streams flow into the sea,<br>
                          yet the sea is never full.<br><br>
                      To the place the streams come from,<br>
                          there they return again.<br><br>
                      8 All things are wearisome,<br>
                          more than one can say.<br>
                      The eye never has enough of seeing,<br>
                          nor the ear its fill of hearing.<br><br>
                      9 What has been will be again,<br>
                          what has been done will be done again;<br>
                          there is nothing new under the sun.<br><br>
                      10 Is there anything of which one can say,<br>
                          “Look! This is something new”?<br>
                      It was here already, long ago;<br>
                          it was here before our time.<br><br>
                      11 No one remembers the former generations,<br>
                          and even those yet to come<br>
                      will not be remembered<br>
                          by those who follow them.<br><br>

                      <b>Wisdom Is Meaningless</b><br>
                      12 I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.<br><br>
                      13 I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind!<br><br>
                      14 I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.<br><br>

                      15 What is crooked cannot be straightened;<br>
                          what is lacking cannot be counted.<br><br>

                      16 I said to myself, “Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.” <br><br>
                      17 Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.<br><br>

                      18 For with much wisdom comes much sorrow;<br>
                          the more knowledge, the more grief.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Ecclesiastes 2:1-26 (NIV)</b><br>

                  <b>Pleasures Are Meaningless</b><br>
                
                       1 I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good.” But that also proved to be meaningless.<br><br>
                       2 “Laughter,” I said, “is madness. And what does pleasure accomplish?”<br><br>
                       3 I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives.<br><br>

                      4 I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.<br><br>
                      5 I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.<br><br>
                      6 I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees.<br><br>
                      7 I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.<br><br>
                      8 I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and a harem as well—the delights of a man's heart.<br><br>
                      9 I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.<br><br>

                      10 I denied myself nothing my eyes desired;<br>
                            I refused my heart no pleasure.<br>
                        My heart took delight in all my labor,<br>
                            and this was the reward for all my toil.<br><br>
                        11 Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done<br>
                            and what I had toiled to achieve,<br>
                        everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind;<br>
                            nothing was gained under the sun.<br><br>

                      <b>Wisdom and Folly Are Meaningless</b><br>
                      12 Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom,<br>
                          and also madness and folly.<br>
                      What more can the king's successor do<br>
                          than what has already been done?<br><br>
                      13 I saw that wisdom is better than folly,<br>
                          just as light is better than darkness.<br><br>
                      14 The wise have eyes in their heads,<br>
                          while the fool walks in the darkness;<br>
                      but I came to realize<br>
                          that the same fate overtakes them both.<br><br>

                      15 Then I said to myself,<br><br>

                      “The fate of the fool will overtake me also.<br>
                          What then do I gain by being wise?”<br>
                      I said to myself,<br>
                          “This too is meaningless.”<br><br>
                      16 For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered;<br>
                          the days have already come when both have been forgotten.<br>
                      Like the fool, the wise too must die!<br><br>

                      <b>Toil Is Meaningless</b><br>
                      17 So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.<br><br>
                      18 I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.<br><br>
                      19 And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.<br><br>
                      20 So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.<br><br>
                      21 For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.<br><br>
                      22 What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? 23 All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.<br><br>

                      24 A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,<br><br>
                      25 for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?<br><br>
                      26 To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

                  <b>The Teacher's Final Words</b><br>

                  1 Remember your Creator<br>
                      in the days of your youth,<br>
                  before the days of trouble come<br>
                      and the years approach when you will say,<br>
                      “I find no pleasure in them”—<br><br>
  
                  2 before the sun and the light<br>
                      and the moon and the stars grow dark,<br>
                      and the clouds return after the rain;<br><br>
  
                  3 when the keepers of the house tremble,<br>
                      and the strong men stoop,<br>
                  when the grinders cease because they are few,<br>
                      and those looking through the windows grow dim;<br><br>
  
                  4 when the doors to the street are closed<br>
                      and the sound of grinding fades;<br>
                  when people rise up at the sound of birds,<br>
                      but all their songs grow faint;<br><br>
  
                  5 when people are afraid of heights<br>
                      and of dangers in the streets;<br>
                  when the almond tree blossoms<br>
                      and the grasshopper drags itself along<br>
                      and desire no longer is stirred.<br>
                  Then people go to their eternal home<br>
                      and mourners go about the streets.<br><br>
  
                  6 Remember him—before the silver cord is severed,<br>
                      and the golden bowl is broken;<br>
                  before the pitcher is shattered at the spring,<br>
                      and the wheel broken at the well,<br><br>
  
                  7 and the dust returns to the ground it came from,<br>
                      and the spirit returns to God who gave it.<br><br>
  
                  8 “Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher.<br>
                      “Everything is meaningless!”<br><br>
  
                  <p><b>The Conclusion of the Matter</b><br>
                  9 Not only was the Teacher wise, but he also imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.<br><br>
                  10 The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true.<br><br>
  
                  11 The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails—given by one shepherd.<br><br>
                  
                  12 Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them.<br>
  
                  Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.<br><br>

              </li>
              <li>7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. </li>
              <li>8 Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.</li>

        </li>
        <li>Amplified Version
          <ul>

            </li>
            <li>7 I have fought the good and worthy and noble fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith firmly guarding the gospel against error.</li>

        <li>Our time on earth is the opportunity to shape our eternal destiny. We cannot choose where we will spend eternity after our life here. What will determine our eternal fate is how we live our lives on earth.</li>
