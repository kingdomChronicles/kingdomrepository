            <h1>A Question About Life Purpose</h1>
        </center>

        <p><b>Introduction:</b> <br>

          Many people may not fully recognize or live according to the life purpose that God has planned for them. Most people do not understand the true foundation of their life’s purpose.
        </p>
        
    
        <p class="keyPoints">I. Are you aware that the majority of people are not living according to the life purpose God has created for them?</p>
            <ol>
              <li>In your opinion, what is your purpose in life?</li>
              <li>Is our existence solely about being born, getting an education, securing a good job or starting a business, raising a family, and ultimately die.</li>
              <li>Are you aware that many individuals who are deemed successful by worldly standards often experience deep regrets in their old age or on their deathbed?</li>
            </ol>

        

        <p class="keyPoints">II. Life Lessons from Three Great Figures in the World.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Steve Jobs</b> - A billionaire, an American entrepreneur, inventor and a business magnate best known as the co-founder of Apple Inc.</li>
              <li><b>Alexander the Great</b> - was a Macedonian king and one of history's most successful military commanders, known for creating one of the largest empires in the ancient world. One of history's greatest conquerors, who conquered many kingdoms at a young age (20 y.o.) and conquered vast land in a short span of time.</li>
              <li><b>King Solomon</b>  - Known as one of the greatest kings in biblical history due to his wisdom, wealth and accomplishments.</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">These individuals are regarded as some of the most successful people in the world. Let’s explore their perspectives on life, death, and their accomplishments.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><b>Steve Jobs</b><br> 
                  "I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others' eyes, my life is the epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. Ultimately, my wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on my bed and recalling my life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in have paled and become meaningless in the face of my death."
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Alexander the Great</b><br> 
                  When the great King fell ill, which led him to his deathbed. He gathered his generals and told them, "I will depart from this world soon; I have three wishes, please carry them out without fail."<br><br>

                  The king asked his general to abide by these last wishes:
                </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>“My physicians alone must carry my coffin.”</li>
                      <li>"I desire that when my coffin is transported to the grave, the path leading to the graveyard will display the wealth I collected," </li>
                      <li>"My third and last wish is that both my hands hang out of my coffin."</li>
                    </ol>
    
                <p>The generals agreed to abide by their king's last wishes and asked him why he was doing so. Alexander said, "I want the world to know the three lessons I have just learned."<br><br>
                   The king interpreted his wishes and continued,</p>
    
                    <ol>
                      <li>"I want my physicians to carry my coffin because people should realize that no doctor can cure anybody. They are helpless in front of death."</li>
                      <li>The king described his second wish: "I spent all my life earning riches but cannot take anything with me. Let people know that wealth is nothing but dust."</li>
                      <li>Third, I wish all to know that I came empty-handed into this world, and I will leave this world empty-handed also."</li>
                    </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>King Solomon</b><br> 
                  God gave Solomon wisdom—the deepest of understanding a man could ever have. <br><br>
                  There was nothing beyond his understanding or control. Solomon's wisdom surpassed that of the famed wise men of the East and outshone the esteemed wisdom of Egypt.<br><br>
                  
                   1. He was wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, wiser than Heman, wiser than Kalkol, and Darda the sons of Mahol.<br><br> 

                   <i>
                   1 Kings 4:31 NIV <br>
                   "He was wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite—wiser than Heman, Kalkol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding nations." 
                  </i><br><br>

                  Ethan the Ezrahite is mentioned in this passage as one of the wise men whose wisdom was surpassed by King Solomon. The verse highlights Solomon's exceptional wisdom by comparing it to that of other renowned wise men, including Ethan<br><br>

                   2. He became renowned among all the neighboring nations, composing 3,000 proverbs and writing 1,005 songs. <br><br>

                   3. He had extensive knowledge about plants, from the large cedars of Lebanon to the small hyssop that grows in the crevices of a wall.<br><br> 

                   4. He had a comprehensive understanding of all creatures, including animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.<br><br>

                  5. Kings from all over the earth, who had heard of his reputation, visited Solomon, and people traveled from near and far to hear his wisdom.<br><br>

          <p> Let's learn Solomon's Reflection about Life?<br><br>
                      Ecclesiastes Chapters 1, 2, and 12</p>

                <p><b>Ecclesiastes 1:1-11 (NLT)</b><br>
                  <b>Everything Is Meaningless</b><br>
                
                      1 These are the words of the Teacher, King David’s son, who ruled in Jerusalem.<br><br>

                      2 “Everything is meaningless,” says the Teacher, “completely meaningless!”<br><br>

                      3  What do people get for all their hard work under the sun?<br><br>
                      4 Generations come and generations go, but the earth never changes.<br><br>
                      5 The sun rises and the sun sets, then hurries around to rise again.<br><br>
                      6 The wind blows south, and then turns north. Around and around it goes, blowing in circles.<br><br>
                      7 Rivers run into the sea, but the sea is never full. Then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea.<br><br>
                      8 Everything is wearisome beyond description. No matter how much we see, we are never satisfied. No matter how much we hear, we are not content.<br><br>
                      9 History merely repeats itself. It has all been done before. Nothing under the sun is truly new.<br><br>
                      10 Sometimes people say, “Here is something new!” But actually it is old; nothing is ever truly new.<br><br>
                      11 We don’t remember what happened in the past, and in future generations, no one will remember what we are doing now.<br><br>

                  <p><b>Ecclesiastes 1:12-18 (NLT)</b><br>                                       <b>Wisdom Is Meaningless</b><br>

                      12 I, the Teacher, was king of Israel, and I lived in Jerusalem.<br><br>
                      13 I devoted myself to search for understanding and to explore by wisdom everything being done under heaven. I soon discovered that God has dealt a tragic existence to the human race.<br><br>
                      14 I observed everything going on under the sun, and really, it is all meaningless—like chasing the wind.<br><br>
                      15 What is wrong cannot be made right. What is missing cannot be recovered.<br><br>
                      16 I said to myself, “Look, I am wiser than any of the kings who ruled in Jerusalem before me. I have greater wisdom and knowledge than any of them.” <br><br>
                      17 So I set out to learn everything from wisdom to madness and folly. But I learned firsthand that pursuing all this is like chasing the wind.<br><br>
                      18 The greater my wisdom, the greater my grief. To increase knowledge only increases sorrow.

                <p><b>Ecclesiastes 2:1-11 (NLT)</b><br>
                  <b>The Futility of Pleasure</b><br>
                
                       1 I said to myself, “Come on, let’s try pleasure. Let’s look for the ‘good things’ in life.” But I found that this, too, was meaningless.<br><br>
                       2 So I said, “Laughter is silly. What good does it do to seek pleasure?”<br><br>
                       3 After much thought, I decided to cheer myself with wine. And while still seeking wisdom, I clutched at foolishness. In this way, I tried to experience the only happiness most people find during their brief life in this world.<br><br>
                      4 I also tried to find meaning by building huge homes for myself and by planting beautiful vineyards.<br><br>
                      5 I made gardens and parks, filling them with all kinds of fruit trees.<br><br>
                      6 I built reservoirs to collect the water to irrigate my many flourishing groves.<br><br>
                      7 I bought slaves, both men and women, and others were born into my household. I also owned large herds and flocks, more than any of the kings who had lived in Jerusalem before me.<br><br>
                      8 I collected great sums of silver and gold, the treasure of many kings and provinces. I hired wonderful singers, both men and women, and had many beautiful concubines. I had everything a man could desire!<br><br>
                      9 So I became greater than all who had lived in Jerusalem before me, and my wisdom never failed me.<br><br>
                      10 Anything I wanted, I would take. I denied myself no pleasure. I even found great pleasure in hard work, a reward for all my labors.<br><br>
                      11 But as I looked at everything I had worked so hard to accomplish, it was all so meaningless—like chasing the wind. There was nothing really worthwhile anywhere. <br><br>

                      </li>
                      <li>
          <p><b>Ecclesiastes 2:12-17 (NLT)</b><br>
            <b>The Wise and the Foolish</b><br>
            
                      12 So I decided to compare wisdom with foolishness and madness (for who can do this better than I, the king?).<br><br>
                      13 I thought, “Wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness.<br><br>
                      14 For the wise can see where they are going, but fools walk in the dark.” Yet I saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate.<br><br>
                      15 Both will die. So I said to myself, “Since I will end up the same as the fool, what’s the value of all my wisdom? This is all so meaningless!”<br><br>
                      16 For the wise and the foolish both die. The wise will not be remembered any longer than the fool. In the days to come, both will be forgotten.<br><br>
                      17 So I came to hate life because everything done here under the sun is so troubling. Everything is meaningless—like chasing the wind.<br><br>


        <p><b>Ecclesiastes 2:18-26 (NLT)</b><br>
          <b>The Futility of Work</b><br>
                     
                      18 I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.<br><br>
                      19 And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.<br><br>
                      20 So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.<br><br>
                      21 For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.<br><br>
                      22 What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? 23 All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.<br><br>

                      24 A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,<br><br>
                      25 for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?<br><br>
                      26 To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

                <p><b>Ecclesiastes 12:1-12 (NIV)</b><br>
                  <b>The Teacher's Final Words</b><br>

                  1 Remember your Creator<br>
                      in the days of your youth,<br>
                  before the days of trouble come<br>
                      and the years approach when you will say,<br>
                      “I find no pleasure in them”—<br><br>
  
                  2 before the sun and the light<br>
                      and the moon and the stars grow dark,<br>
                      and the clouds return after the rain;<br><br>
  
                  3 when the keepers of the house tremble,<br>
                      and the strong men stoop,<br>
                  when the grinders cease because they are few,<br>
                      and those looking through the windows grow dim;<br><br>
  
                  4 when the doors to the street are closed<br>
                      and the sound of grinding fades;<br>
                  when people rise up at the sound of birds,<br>
                      but all their songs grow faint;<br><br>
  
                  5 when people are afraid of heights<br>
                      and of dangers in the streets;<br>
                  when the almond tree blossoms<br>
                      and the grasshopper drags itself along<br>
                      and desire no longer is stirred.<br>
                  Then people go to their eternal home<br>
                      and mourners go about the streets.<br><br>
  
                  6 Remember him—before the silver cord is severed,<br>
                      and the golden bowl is broken;<br>
                  before the pitcher is shattered at the spring,<br>
                      and the wheel broken at the well,<br><br>
  
                  7 and the dust returns to the ground it came from,<br>
                      and the spirit returns to God who gave it.<br><br>
  
                  8 “Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher.<br>
                      “Everything is meaningless!”<br><br>
  
                  <p><b>The Conclusion of the Matter</b><br>
                  9 Not only was the Teacher wise, but he also imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.<br><br>
                  10 The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true.<br><br>
  
                  11 The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails—given by one shepherd.<br><br>
                  
                  12 Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them.<br>
  
                  Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.<br><br>

        <li>This earthly life is not our ultimate existence; instead, we are all destined for eternity. We will either spend eternity in torment or in the presence of our Creator.</li>
        <li>Our time on earth is the opportunity to shape our eternal destiny. We cannot choose where we will spend eternity after our life here. What will determine our eternal fate is how we live our lives on earth.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li>
          <b>Matthew 25:46</b>:
          And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Revelation 20:10</b>:
          And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Revelation 20:15</b>:
          And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Revelation 14:11</b>:
          And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Revelation 21:8</b>:
          But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mark 8:36-38 AMP (Amplified Version)</b>:
          <sup>36</sup> For what does it benefit a man to gain the whole world [with all its pleasures], and forfeit his soul? <sup>37</sup> For what will a man give in exchange for his soul and eternal life [in God’s kingdom]? <sup>38</sup> For whoever is ashamed [here and now] of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.”<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Hebrews 9:27 NLT</b>:
          <sup>27</sup> And just as each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgment,<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>John 10:10 AMP (Amplified Version)</b>:
          The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life, and have it in abundance [to the full, till it overflows].<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Matthew 11:28-30 AMP (Amplified Version)</b>:
          <sup>28</sup>  “Come to Me, all who are weary and heavily burdened [by religious rituals that provide no peace], and I will give you rest [refreshing your souls with salvation]. <sup>29</sup> Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me [following Me as My disciple], for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest (renewal, blessed quiet) for your souls. <sup>30</sup> For My yoke is easy [to bear] and My burden is light.”<br><br>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>This can happen for various reasons, such as being distracted by worldly concerns, not understanding God's Word, or not seeking His guidance through prayer and devotion.
        <br>
        According to the Bible, God has a unique purpose for each person, rooted in His desire for them to fulfill their role in His Kingdom and live in alignment with His will (Ephesians 2:10). Discovering this purpose requires spiritual awareness, a relationship with God, and a willingness to surrender to His plans.</p>

      <p>Conclusion:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Once your eternal destiny is secured, your personal purpose in this life will be revealed.</li>
        <li>Having a clear understanding of your personal purpose will help you grasp your role and purpose within your country and community.</li>
        <li>Engaging in these roles will eventually lead you to discover your higher purpose, enabling you to experience true fulfillment in life.</li>
      </ol>
