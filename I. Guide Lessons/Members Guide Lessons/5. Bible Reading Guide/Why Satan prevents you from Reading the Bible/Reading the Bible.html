    <h2>Why Does Satan Hinder People from Reading the Bible?</h2>
</center>


<hr>

   

      <p>Satan’s opposition to reading the Bible is deeply rooted in his desire to keep humanity from discovering the truth about God, themselves, and their purpose in life. The Bible is referred to as the "Word of God" and contains wisdom, commandments, and truths essential for salvation and living a life pleasing to God. Satan, whose main goal is to lead people away from God, actively works to prevent people from reading, understanding, and living out the truths in Scripture. <br><br>

                <i>
                <b>John 8:44 ESV</b>
                You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies. <br><br>
                
                
                <b>John 17:17 ESV</b>
                Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.

          </div><br>
        
          <p>
        1. One of the main reasons Satan doesn’t want people to read the Bible is that it exposes his lies. Jesus called Satan the “father of lies” in John 8:44, saying, “there is no truth in him” and “he is a liar and the father of lies.” <br><br>
        
        2. In contrast, the Bible is a source of truth. Jesus prayed, “Sanctify them by your truth; your word is truth” (John 17:17). Reading the Bible brings people into contact with God’s truth, which can challenge Satan’s lies and schemes.   </p><br>

                In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. <br><br>
                
                <b>Romans 6:23 NLT</b>
                For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.

          <p>
        1. Satan wants to keep people in spiritual darkness and away from the salvation offered through Jesus Christ. The apostle Paul explained this when he wrote, “The god of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God” (2 Corinthians 4:4). <br><br>
        
        2. The Bible reveals God’s plan for salvation, culminating in the death and resurrection of Jesus. It shows that “the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23). By preventing people from reading the Bible, Satan aims to stop them from discovering the free gift of eternal life. </p><br>

                <b>Matthew 4:1-11 NLT</b> <br>
                <sup>1</sup> Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted there by the devil. <sup>2</sup> For forty days and forty nights he fasted and became very hungry. <sup>3</sup> During that time the devil came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.” <sup>4</sup> But Jesus told him, “No! The Scriptures say, ‘People do not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’ ” <sup>5</sup> Then the devil took him to the holy city, Jerusalem, to the highest point of the Temple, <sup>6</sup> and said, “If you are the Son of God, jump off! For the Scriptures say, ‘He will order his angels to protect you. And they will hold you up with their hands so you won’t even hurt your foot on a stone.’” <sup>7</sup> Jesus responded, “The Scriptures also say, ‘You must not test the Lord your God.’” <sup>8</sup> Next the devil took him to the peak of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. <sup>9</sup> “I will give it all to you,” he said, “if you will kneel down and worship me.” <sup>10</sup>  “Get out of here, Satan,” Jesus told him. “For the Scriptures say, ‘You must worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’ ” <sup>11</sup> Then the devil went away, and angels came and took care of Jesus.

          <p>
        The Bible equips believers with knowledge and strength to resist temptation. When Satan tempted Jesus in the wilderness, Jesus responded to each temptation by quoting Scripture: “It is written...” (Matthew 4:1-11). Jesus demonstrated the power of God’s Word as a weapon against the devil’s schemes. Satan doesn’t want people reading the Bible because it empowers them to resist his efforts to lead them into sin. </p> <br><br>

        <b>IV. The Bible Strengthens Faith</b>  </p>

                <b>Romans 10:17 KJV </b>
                So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

              </div>
            </div>
          </div><br>
          <p>
        Faith is essential to a believer’s walk with God, and Satan seeks to weaken it. Romans 10:17 says, “Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.” The Bible strengthens faith in God’s promises, His character, and His ability to fulfill His Word. By hindering people from reading Scripture, Satan can weaken their faith, making them more susceptible to doubt, fear, and disobedience.  </p><br><br>

                <b>James 1:22 AMP </b>
                But prove yourselves doers of the word [actively and continually obeying God’s precepts], and not merely listeners [who hear the word but fail to internalize its meaning], deluding yourselves [by unsound reasoning contrary to the truth]. 

                </i></p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div><br>
          <p>
        The Bible contains God’s commandments and instructions for living a holy life, which goes against Satan’s desires. James 1:22 calls us to “be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.” Satan doesn’t want believers to be “doers of the word” because obedience to God weakens his influence in their lives. The Bible not only teaches holiness but also provides guidance and conviction to follow it. </p> <br><br>

                <b>Ephesians 4:14 ESV </b>
                so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.

            </div>
          </div><br>        
        
          <p>
        1. Satan wants to keep people spiritually immature and weak. The apostle Peter encouraged believers to “grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 3:18). <br><br> 
        
        2. Spiritual growth comes through reading, studying, and living out God’s Word. Ephesians 4:14-15 warns against being “tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine,” which happens when people lack knowledge of Scriptural truth. By discouraging people from reading the Bible, Satan hopes to keep them spiritually immature and easily misled by false teachings. </p> <br><br>
        


        <p>
        <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>
        
        Satan doesn’t want you to read the Bible because it is the foundation of spiritual truth, the revelation of God’s plan for salvation, and the key to living a life of faith and obedience. The Bible empowers believers to resist temptation, strengthens their faith, and helps them grow in holiness. By preventing people from reading, understanding, and applying Scripture, Satan seeks to keep them in spiritual darkness, far from God. Therefore, we must be vigilant, actively reading and meditating on God’s Word to be prepared for Satan’s attacks and to live lives that glorify God.
