      <p>God’s will is shown in His Word. Understanding His wisdom helps us know who He is and what He wants from us. <br><br>
  
          No matter what we've learned, giving up our will to God is necessary for anyone who wants to truly follow and serve Him. <br><br>
          
          <b>How to Walk Like Jesus...</b> <br>
          
          In <b>Luke 22:42</b>, Jesus says, “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; <b>yet not my will, but Yours be done</b>.” <br><br>
          
          The idea of surrendering our will to God is a key message of the Bible. <br><br>
          
          Our human nature can be very deceptive and rebellious, making people think God doesn't care about what we say or do.<br><br>
          
          Pray for wisdom to understand that our disobedience is a serious issue.<br><br>
          
          Our emotions don't care if we are spiritually lost as long as we are in control of our decisions. But God should be the one making the decisions.<br><br>
          
          Adam and Eve chose their own way despite God's warnings, showing the rebellious nature of all humanity.<br><br>
          
          Remember, ignoring God's warnings leads to serious and unchangeable consequences.<br><br>
          
          Each child of God has a unique role in His Kingdom.<br><br>
          
          Our different gifts, talents, and personalities are meant to fulfill His perfect plan.<br><br>
          
          Living as Christians means we have responsibilities that we need to understand and follow for the rest of our lives.<br><br>
          
          True wisdom begins with respecting God, which means we must rely on His strength and attitude for success.<br><br>
          
          Those who try to mix their will with God’s will or let denial lead them into subtle rebellion will find their efforts fail.<br><br>
          
          Even if they work hard, they end up feeling empty and dissatisfied.<br><br>
          
          Why? Because God does not accept or bless offerings made on our terms.<br><br>
          
          Until we truly give up control and yield our will to Him, we haven’t really surrendered to God.<br><br>
