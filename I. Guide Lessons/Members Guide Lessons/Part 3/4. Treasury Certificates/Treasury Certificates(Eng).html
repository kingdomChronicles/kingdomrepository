    <h2>PREFACE</h2>

    <p>(Historical Origin of Filipino People's Treasury)</p>

    
   <p>The Origin of these Huge Funds were came from King Bernardo Carpio, during the early times for the Philippine Islands where some natives from Malaysia, Indonesia, Mongolia, China, Arab, India, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam and other Asian Natives including some natives from Eastern Russia, it is but uncommon that the Philippine Islands as some legends spoken that it is the Land of Incant Spirits or Land of Spiritual Fairies whereas according to the myth which <b>the Philippine Islands was a Biblical but True Story that some current natives in the Islands were the descendants of the Spiritual Tribes of Israel. And called the new landmark of Holy Promise Land</b>, but the story was enchanted and full of spiritual imagination. <br><br> 
    
    And that of story proceeds which we given the full context of the story that the Holy Land have full Spiritual Power and Glorious Blessings according to the divine promise, the context of this revelation of the multiple Assets of the People of the Philippine Islands were Originated from King Bernardo Carpio who is the Original Holder of White Mongolian Account and it was revealed when C3 AM 01and thru the context of previous rendered ad hoc decisions of the International Court of Justice that the Mongolian Raiders were signed into an old document stating, as described by the Old Mongolian Text Authenticator, that the Mongolian Adventurers must be paid the Islands two worth or weighed of taken one worth or weighed of gold they taken in the Philippine Islands and it started a thousand years ago which those worthy treasures were expanded and preserved, as hidden, into more lands where the Mongolian occupied and it was admitted by some Ancient European Leaders when they recovered some of those Treasures in Eastern Europe (which those documents were kept by C3 - AM-01). <br><br>
    
    And it classified by some Mongolian Warriors under captive by the European Society and they used some of these recoveries to hunt more lands outside Europe that served thereof as European Competition of Land Occupation. And there and then Europeans successfully landed to all Lands worldwide until the Spaniards landed in the Islands and they took the Islands as one of the discoveries of Spaniards and they tried to occupy the lands without any permission from the local natives there and they successfully claimed that lands using a match old print of map as similarly possessed by C3-AM-01 with appearance of the Authentic Signature of King Bernardo Carpio, Spanish King Philip VI, US Pres. William McKinley, Dr. Jose P. Rizal, US Pres. Gerald Ford, US Sec. Henry Kissinger and Pres. Ferdinand Marcos, <br><br>
    
    Which appeared thereafter thru Federal Agreement dated September 10, 1976 that Marcos was paid Philippine Islands sometime on year 1976 worth US$ 20, 000, 000, 000 or 10, 000 metric tons of gold as comparable to precious metal value and Spain successfully obtained the Islands by using that Carpio's Treasures and there and there, Spain occupied the Islands for more than 300 years until Dr. Jose Rizal came and reconstituted those wealth in the name of the People of the Philippine Islands under White Vatican Account<br><br>
    
    And the death of Dr. Rizal brought Spain under trouble and end of illegal occupation and with the pretending aid of the American Authorities, that caused thereof to end their conflict and made a Treaty and on December 10, 1898 the Treaty of Paris were ratified by and between the United States of America and Spain and paid Spain the sum of US$ 20, 000, 000 of total land area covering the Islands of Luzon to the Islands of Sabah with a constant measurement of 452,000 sq. km. under its previous name: Titulo De Propriedad Numero 4136. <br><br> 
    
    And after the ratification of said Treaty, the US Authorities occupied the Islands under that Treaty without any confirmation if the People of the Islands will be permitted by them to occupy the land and thru that Titulo that possesses by Dr. Rizal, it was been sold by Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. The entrance of year 1900 was so crucial for mankind when there an occurrence of World War 1 and 2 which the host of WWI forcibly abated and debated with other countries in Europe about the equal sharing of benefits to be collected from White Mongolian and Vatican Account.<br><br> 
    
    And thereafter the American Authorities forcibly left the Islands during World War 2 including the Original Documents of the Original Certificate of Title no. 779 under Survey Plan no. II - 4509 and thereafter the American Authorities reoccupy the Island without that documents that already addressed by UN General Assembly Pres. Carlos P. Romulo that the United States of America already left the Islands including those Original Documented Land Title and Survey Plan and the Assembly agreed not to practice their greed to reoccupy the Islands but agreed as stated that the Islands will be under supervision of the US Authorities and they will be given the Islands
    an Independence if they will be bought the Islands in the sum of US$ 100, 000, 000 within 50 years from time since the United Nation Organization was established.<br><br> 


    And before the Axis Powers fall into the Allied Powers, they entered Multiple Assets and Properties of the Axis Powers which
    distinguished by the Axis Powers as both King Carpio and Dr. Rizal Assets and Properties and was admitted by Pres. Karl Donitz that those loots belong to the Philippine Islands cause he admitted that both Adolf Hitler (son of Ignacio Enrique Coronado) and Tomoyuki Yamashita (son of Judge Alfonso Pijao) were a half Filipino Natives and they wanted their fathers to be satisfied with their loots not intended for them which Ignacio Enrique Coronado and acclaimed as Dr. Jose Rizal and Judge Alfonso Pijao was acclaimed as Bernardo Carpio <br><br>
    
    And those Treasures were set into more controversies among those war ravaged and non war ravaged countries that caused for King George VI to establish the World Court to promulgate Judgment over said issue under ICJ case no. 1425 and it reconsidered to reaffirm this Judgment sometime on year 1975 and Pres. Ferdinand Edralin Marcos filed and time deposited, under White Eagle Account and reinserted under this Account the White Mongolian and Vatican Account, some compensation assistance from Germany, Italy and Japan and some of these loots to some Banks in Europe both under Certificate of Deposits that to be matured from year 2000 and beyond which caused for the treasure pleaders to concentrate or point their claims over said deposits that sponsored by multiple treasures identified as loot of the Axis Powers<br><br>

    Which Pres. Marcos respond these inter-pleadings that those treasures were unexpectedly hide by the Axis Powers and unexpectedly recovered during his term of Office and by virtue of the International Court rulings those were belongs to the Treasury and Benefit of the People of the Philippine Islands. And after Marcos deposed sometime on year 1966, the sets and Committee of 300 under Queen Elizabeth II was designated as Trustee over said Deposits and the Committe of 300 whose assets and Properties under Global Agreement held by C3-AM-01 which we hereinto affirmed the same. And multiple pleader and claimants appeared before these Authorities to shift that wealth to them but there's a Spiritual Warning over said wealth that these wealth will never be set for personal or
    self-vested interest and therefore Denied all said Pleaders or Interest Parties for said wealth and this was solely prevailed by C3-AM-01 with reconfirmed as recognized Identity as Sole Authorized Signatory for these wealth and Sole Authorized Representative for Certifled Documents of Pres. Marcos<br><br>
    
    
    And by virtue of the International Rulings over these cases, that these Matured Funds was totally Cleared by any Criminal 
    Offenses and subject to be claimed by the People of the Philippine islands only thru ASBLP Group Group of Companies and Bank of ASBLP reconfirmed International Registry in the Committee of 300 as represented by C3 - AM-01 or HM, King Anthony Santiago Martin 
    and the People of the Philippine Islands only thru ASBLP Group of Companies and Bank of ASBLP represented by C3 - AM-01
    HM, King Anthony Santago Martin was Solely Claimed, as Reconfirmed, the following Provenances given herein below
